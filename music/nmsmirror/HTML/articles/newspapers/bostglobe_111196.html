<font size=+1>RUSH BRIDGES THE DECADES WITH EASE</font><br>
<b>by Paul Robicheau</b><p>

The more things change, the more they stay the same for Rush.  Yet the
Canadian rock trio keeps moving within its idiosyncratic yet successful
reign over the arenas for two decades.  And after a near-three-year
hiatus, Rush hit a packed FleetCenter Saturday with a lean, refreshed
delivery that bridged the '70s, '80s, and '90s.<P>
        The two-set show, topping 2 1/2 hours, let Rush stretch out more
than ever, from the 20-minute "2112" - an awkwardly futuristic suite with
fans shouting "Hey!" on cue and quadrophonic sound like it was 1976 all
over again - to several songs from the flat new "Test For Echo," which
were much better live.<P>
        Rush had a typically colorful light show, backing video (from
cartoon imagery to perfect-angle stage action) and a few props
(laser-firing radar dishes for the new CD's title track).  Yet the
emphasis remained on the trio's precise musicianship, which married
hard-rock flourishes with tricky, fusionlike shifts.<P>
        Drummer Neil Peart anchored the fresh attack, as he juggled mixed
stick grips with a looser feel, suggesting the influence of a recent
Buddy Rich tribute project.  his platform revolved from a primary new
single-bass kit to a double-bass set with electronic drums for "Red
Sector A" and "The Trees," which he spiced with cowbells.  And his later
solo remained indulgent but thoughtfully varied as a peerless tour de force.<P>
        Geddy Lee reached to sing the old high notes of "2112," yet
mostly seemed relaxed, even in lashing fleet, funky bass lines.  He
played less synthesizer, but mixed analog and digital sounds.  And
guitarist Alex Lifeson squeezed frantic bursts in freedom tales "Red
Barchetta" and "Freewill" that contrasted with his edgy, spacious chords
in newer songs like "Roll The Bones."<P>
        An encore of chock-a-block instrumental "YYZ" underscored Rush's
spot as an arena anomaly.  The trio's growth from Zeppelinesque space
rockers to cool techinicians couldn't have maintained fan support without
heart and humor.  As Lee sang in "Spirit of the Radio" (and airplay is
short now for Rush), "All this machinery making modern music can still be
open-hearted."<p>
