<font size=+1>Relics Of The Seventies Rock Into The Nineties</font><br>
<b>by John F. Comes</b><p>

Three men from the Great White North visited Savage Hall Saturday and 
promptly blew the doors off the place.<p>

The Canadian trio Rush proved that it can still put on a crowd-pleasing 
show in the pop-infected nineties.<p>

Frontman Geddy Lee, bass, keyboards and vocals, wasted little time and 
energy with the fake crowd chatter and got down to the business at hand. 
Backed by Alex Lifeson, guitars, and Neil Peart, drums, Lee used his 
trademark vocal styling to keep the near-capacity crowd on its feet for most 
of the show.<p>

Kicking off with "Force Ten," Rush played most of its well-known cuts 
from its long career. Songs like "Limelight," "Subdivisions," and "Big 
Money" did not lose any of their studio polished feel, but instead became 
soaring tracks blending big bass and searing guitar riffs with incessant 
drumming to shake the crowd as well as the rafters.<p>

Peart, apparently unaffected by his wrist problem, stole the show with a
15-minute solo. In recent years, solos have become a boring break or 
outrageous bravado, as in Motley Crue's Tommy Lee's contrived solos. But 
Peart made his solo a highlight of the show by using a combination of 
chimes, electronic drum pads, cowbells, and huge floor toms and kettle drums 
to showcase his drum skills.<p>

Lifeson, who was restrained in comparison to other guitarists, blended 
perfectly with Lee and Peart to help power the Rush sound. This is not to 
say he was lifeless, but rather a precisely made gear in a well-oiled 
machine.<p>

When the show opened, it looked to be your run-of-the-mill concert, but 
as the musical frenzy grew, so did the stage and lighting. A huge screen 
behind the group bombarded the crowd with video clips and surreal images.
The light show picked up when laser lights and multiple light patterns 
danced across the hall. The stage opened up to unleash even more lighting.
Rush also brought along two huge inflatable rabbits from its "Presto" 
tour. The rabbits came to life during "Tom Sawyer" and caused the loudest 
crowd reaction of the night.<p>

Rush came into town and proved once again that good rock music does not 
age, it only gets better.
