<p>

Went off to the doctor<br>
He slowly probes and grins<br>
Feces just won't descend<br>
In your large intestine<p>

Pounding at your anus<br>
Just inject this solution<br>
Sphincter muscle tense -- to fence the enema within<p>

I'm not giving in to this constipation's pressure<br>
I'm not going to live through that kind of awful torture<br>
I'm not giving up, try impossible schemes<p>

Listening to your screams --<br>
Listening to your screams<p>

You start to feel much stranger<br>
As he slides the enema in<br>
Face down on the pillow<br>
Feel the sudden need to break wind<p>

To the bathroom with a charge --<br>
This dung you can't hold in<br>
Glassy-eyed, mudslide, can't hide the enema within<p>

To you -- bowel movement is satisfaction.<br>
Felt the impact of bowel inaction.<p>

In you -- a solution, no more resistance<br>
     Is it living, or just existence?<br>
     Yeah, you -- it takes a little less persistence<br>
     To sit down and go the distance...<p>
