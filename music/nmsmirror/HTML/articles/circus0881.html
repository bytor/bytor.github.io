<strong>
    "Rush wrap up five-month tour" by Steve Weitzman</strong><br><br>

 <em>[ Taken from <strong>Circus</strong> -- August 31, 1981 ]</em><p>

THE ONE THING that's always been most appealing about Rush is that
they don't take themselves too seriously. They reaffirmed that fact
early on at their sold-out New York Madison Square Garden show when
they came on stage stone-faced and jumped into "We Are the Priests"
while the youthful audience lapped it up.<p>

Your Circus correspondent went in with an open mind, not having
seen this Toronto trio for a few years. The <strong>Moving Pictures</strong> tour
which had begun way back on February 20 in Michigan, was being
highly touted in ads as one of the audio-visual wonders of the
spring/summer concert season, and we were eager to see whether Rush
could keep up their harrowing, self-imposed pace. (The tour was
scheduled to saturate North America in five months of near daily
performances.)<p>

While the stage was being set up, John Swenson, a respected critic
with whom we usually agree, kept pointing out what a "great band"
they've become. Swenson, who looks like he could be Dr. John's
illegitimate son, couldn't contain his enthusiasm. Knowing his
credibility was at stake since all the rock world would read his
views quoted in this column, he rolled on like the Monongahela.
Saying he came to the show "out of pleasure" and not on assignment,
he added, "I thought they were a joke when I first saw them, but
I've really been impressed by them the last couple of years,
especially since hearing <strong>Permanent Waves</strong> [Mercury]. Wait till you
see the show; the effect they have is Who-like."<p>

What's going on here? Are Rush finally winning over the critics
who've mercilessly been directing written abuse at them for years?
Will there soon be only one writer left unimpressed with Rush?<p>

Rush's two-hour Garden concert, for all its flashy $40,000 light
show and glittery instrumental effects, proved to be one gigantic
yawn. Although Swenson defends the performance and claims that "the
band used to dominated by Alex Lifeson's guitar playing, but now
the spotlight is deservedly more on Geddy Lee," the shift in focus
really doesn't help.<p>

Musically, Rush are in no man's land.<p>

Granted, the three individual members, drummer Neil Peart, Lifeson
and bassist/vocalist Lee are better musicians than those a few
other heavy metal bands (Triumph, Motorhead) can boast. But after
seven years and 11 Mercury albums, they still can't be taken
seriously as instrumentalists when compared to recent powerhouses
like the Mahavishnu Orchestra or Return to Forever.<p>

Yet Alex Lifeson maintained the day after the show that "Our music
doesn't have those classic heavy metal chord changes. We never
considered ourselves a heavy metal band. We feel we have more to
offer than that."<p>

If Rush are not a heavy metal band, then they're a heavy metal band
with pretensions. They're not a true rock & roll band, as their
music is all stiffly calculated and pre-planned. Each identical
performance on this five-month extravaganza (during which Rush have
played to 905,000 people on 79 dates and grossed over $4 million)
holds all the excitement of a Howard Johnson's omelet. And if
they're trying to go the other way, as Lifeson claims, Rush have
never been able to grasp the sort of inherent musical elegance that
progressive bands like Yes and Genesis display.<p>

Though you wouldn't know it from the crowd's reaction, the band's
Iyrics are even weaker than the music. They've gone from utter
cosmic fluff (on previous albums) to inane drivel on <strong>Moving
Pictures</strong>. Take this from "Tom Sawyer": "The world is the world
is/Love and life are deep." Or this, from "Limelight": "Living on a
lighted stage/Approaches the unreal/For those who think and feel/ln
touch with some reality."<p>

The last laugh is had by drummer Neil Peart. He gets to write this
caca and doesn't even have to sing it.<p>
