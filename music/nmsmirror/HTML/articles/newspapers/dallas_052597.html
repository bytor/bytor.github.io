<font size=+1>'Rush' has momentum to spare<br>
Band builds on technique, tunes and turns of phrase</font><br>
<b>by Thor Christensen</b><p>

Rock hipsters always give Rush a good tar-and-feathering because they're
such an easy target.  Those sci-fi lyrics are just begging for
ridicule--not to mention the 10-minute drum solos.<p>

But for a band supposedly trapped in the hoary '70s, Rush sounded
surprisingly fresh Saturday night at Coca-Cola Starplex.  Touring behind
their 16th studio album "Test for Echo", the Canadian power trio kept their
excesses in check while still putting the accent on their jazzy chops.<p>

Geddy Lee, for example, no longer spends most of the show singing like
Alvin of the Chipmunks.  He wisely shifted his voice into a lower register
and put the spotlight on his inventive bass guitar playing.  He played his
instrument like a baritone sax in "Red Barchetta" and ended "Closer to the
Heart" with a funky, African-influenced solo straight out of a Bootsy
Collins concert.<p>

Guitarist Alex Lifeson opted for short, brooding outbursts instead of long
solos.  His riffing in new songs such as "Driven" and "Virtuality" was
closer to death-metal than prog-rock.<p>

And Neil Peart put a sense of swing into Rush's ever-shifting rhythms
while he amused the crowd by tossing a twirling his drumsticks as he
played.  A camera neatly positioned above him gave fledgling drummers a
bird's-eye view of their hero.<p>

Rush brought along its usual array of lasers, lights and video
imagery--all of which dazzled the crowd but was seldom overbearing.  The
emphasis was always on the music.<p>

Not everything clicked, however.  The dense new instrumental "Limbo" (as
in "Rush Limbo":  Get it?) was nowhere near as good as previous
instrumentals such as "YYZ" or "La Villa Strangiato."<p>

And the famous "2112 Medley" from 1976 was hit-and-miss.  The galloping,
guitar driven instrumental that opens the suite was brilliant as always (a
sort of hard-rock version of Richard Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries," if
you will).  But other parts were pure concept-rock cheese.  On the scale of
Bicentennial-year rock, "2112" ranks way below "Never Mind the Bullocks
Here's the Sex Pistols," but higher than "Shake Your Booty" or "Disco
Duck."<p>

The band played plenty of old stuff, including the kitschy anti-war
statement "The Trees" and other philosophic tunes such as "Limelight" and
"Free Will."  But some of the most impressive were newer numbers including
"Nobody's Hero" and "Half the World."<p>

Rush's deep-thinking stories about the human condition have never been
considered hip.  But while Bob Dylan sinks into self-parody, Mr. Peart's
lyrics grow more and more poetic.<p>
