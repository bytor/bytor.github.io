<strong>
  "Rush -- are they still going?" said the cynic. Yes, they
bloody well are, and after 20 years they deserve some respect!
The unique Canadian trio rock like fiends on their attacking
new album, as singer GEDDY LEE tells CHRIS WELCH.
</strong><p>

  It's a constant source of amazement that a band can sell out
huge venues like Wembley Arena, release platinum albums, boast
a worldwide army of fans, and yet still fail to register with
sections of the public at large. I was speaking to a top music
biz executive only recently, who had absolutely no idea Rush
were major players in the rock league. "But they're huge!" I
assured the man with virgin ears. "I don't believe you!" was
the vigorous response.<p>
  But as Rush reach their 20th anniversary next year, the band
that features Alex Lifeson (guitars), Neil Peart (drums) and
Geddy Lee (vocals and bass), celebrate by releasing a strong
new album 'Counterparts' (Atlantic). It's their 19th and third
for Atlantic, and is notable for its heavier, straight ahead
rocking style. Geddy Lee was in London recently and despite a
touch of jet lag, was delighted to explain the evolution of
'Counterparts'.<p>
  "One of our main goals of this record was to have a drier,
bigger sound, especially the rhythmic side of the record. We
have been learning in the past few years, how to become more
groove oriented, which is tough for white Canadian musicians! 
Neil and I have been trying to perfect a lot of new
rhythmic things. There seem to be more bands blending rhythmic
stuff with hard rock, and I think it's a great marriage. It's
one of those bandwagons we are quite happy to jump onto. We
like Fishbone and the Red Hot Chili Peppers who have such
eclectic influences, and their rhythm sections have that
American groove thing going which is very appealing to us."<p>
  The new album seems to be getting away from the old Rush
intensity, but Geddy says: "It's a different kind of intensity,
more gutteral and less cerebral, which will be a great
relief to many people when they hear the record!"<p>
  But there has always been an element of fun and good humor
in Rush, surely, despite their heavy, rather serious image?<p>
  "Oh yes, there always has," smiles Geddy. "You're right.
It's there when we are making the records. I am surprised it
doesn't show more. Maybe the musical colors we use are quite
dark, and gets interpreted as being deadly serious, even when
that's not the intention. But we are not trying to prove to
the world, like U2 that we are not taking ourselves seriously.
We are just more comfortable and more confident, and people
recognize we are not one dimensional."<p>
  An integral member of the band is drummer Neil Peart, who
also writes all their lyrics. It's 20 years since he joined
the band in 1974 but Alex and Geddy still like to call him
their newest member. "I guess we have to regard any time before
that as pre-history," says Geddy. "It's kind of a happy time
for us, knowing we have survived 20 years, with no other
changes. We have talked about expanding the band in the past,
and adding another member to free up my hands and feet. But
Rush is like a young boys club. We don't want any other members
to join! We make it work with the three of us and we don't
have another opinion to deal with, and another personality to
wrestle with on the road. We are afraid of tampering with the
chemistry."<p>
  Rush tend to embark on massive world tours with elaborate
stage shows like their 'Roll The Bones' epic in 1991. Combined
with the complex music they have to remember and deliver each
night, it can be a draining experience.<p>
  "The last one was a long tour, but it was fun until the last
three weeks when it got a bit deadly. We are always nervous
about coming to Europe, but our tours in Britain have always
been fabulous, and it was a joy to play in Eastern Europe."<p>
  Rush took six months off after their 1991 tour and began
writing their latest album. One of their most intriguing new
track is 'Wilderness of Mirrors' [Ed. note: "Double Agent"], a phrase 
which came from a T.S. Elliot poem and was also used by James Angleton
describing the CIA. "It's an odd song, part heaven and hell,
nightmare and dream song. 'Nobody's Hero' is quite different,
and goes out on a limb. It is very strong lyrically, about the
death of two people, and our perception of heroic ideals. We
seem to care for these people who appear to us on screen and
in books, and yet we don't know much about them apart from
this fake image we idolize."<p>
  "Yet we live amongst people who live heroic but quieter
lives, and we don't pay much mind to them, until they are
gone. It is a tragic song but we try to leave it with an
uplifting feeling of hope."<p>
  "Musically I think we are living in a very healthy time.
There was a real hole in the music scene five years ago, but
now a lot of new bands have come from the Western States.
Soundgarden, Fishbone and Primus are really great, interesting
bands. What happens is that because most people in the music
business don't know anything about music, they accidentally
sign some bands that are pretty good. In the wake of Nirvana's
success, a lot a bands who are better musically, have come to
light. A lot of A&R people don't want to take any chances
because their jobs depend on it. I supposes it's understand
able, but unfortunate."<p>
  Rush have never had a standard rock image -- no scandals, no
outrages, just straight ahead music for them. Geddy: "We
switched labels a couple of years ago because we didn't have
any feel for who was at our old company anymore and I kind of
objected to being inherited and transferred from one president
to another. We are NOT a typical band. We're regarded as
difficult because we have low key life styles. We went to
Atlantic because they are more music orientated. We just
needed a fresh start!"<p>
  Rush are obviously determined to play for their fans well
into the 21st century -- and perhaps then the rest of the world
will discover what they're missing!<p>

<strong>Rush 'Counterparts' (Atlantic)<br></strong>
tracks: Animate, Stick it Out, Cut To The Chase, Nobody's
        Hero, Between Sun and Moon, Alien Shore, Double
        Agent, Leave That Thing Alone, Cold Fire, Everyday
        Glory<p>

Rush have moved into a tougher, harder rocking groove on this,
their 19th album. The songs are tightly conceived and delivered
with all their usual panache and renewed vigor. As their
brilliant drummer-cum-composer, Neil Peart kicks off such
tracks as 'Alien Shore' and 'Speed Of Love' with a crisp
flourish of battering snare and bass drums, the strong pulse
is maintained, evens as the guitars of Alex Lifeson leave
those mystical spaces between chiming chords that are at the
heart of the Rush sound. Space, serenity, contemplation, some
anguish, some humor, and a lot of artistic fulfillment
remain the band's forte. The subjects retain the imaginative
perspectives one has come to expect from the Canadian trio.
'Double Agent' proves contradictions and confusions, while
'Nobody's Hero' looks at the contrast between perceived screen
heroics and  the real life bravery of everyday people. The
lyrics unfold like essays, while the bands's music flows like
a ceaseless turbulent tide.<p>
