About the audio clips...</font><p>

The audio clips put on the CD bootleg pages are meant as a GUIDE only,
to tell the relative sound quality as compared to other boots.<p>

They were all originally recorded directly from CD at CD quality (44.1Khz), 
at 16-bit and in stereo. Each clip consists of 3 different songs faded
in & out, and was encoded into MP3 using 44.1Khz & 64k. Each is somewhere
between 500-700k.<p>

PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME HOW TO PLAY THESE FILES. All computers have some sort
of MP3 player available out on the net (Winamp for Windows & Macamp for
the mac work great). Go to your favorite search engine, use the 
keywords "mp3, player, windows (or whatever computer you have)" and I'm 
sure you'll pull something up. <p>

And please let me know if you find these files useful!
