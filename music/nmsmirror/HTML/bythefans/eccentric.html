<font size=+3>The Parody Eccentric</font><br>
by Doug Taylor<br>
<em>July 13, 1997</em><p>

One writer with a challenge<br>
One person with a tune<br>
Seeking inspiration for a silly lampoon<p>

Trying to write some lyrics<br>
Trying to write some verse -- must immerse<br>
Myself within the plot, so I really must rehearse<p>

1-0-0-1-0-0-1<br>
Brain in gear<br>
1-0-0-1-0-0-1<br>
Thoughts go clear<br>
1-0-0-1-0-0<p>

Cursory glance at old ones<br>
My words just don't fit<br>
Version one's in progress but it sure won't get submit<p>

Sentence structure break down<br>
I think I've strained my wrist  -- must persist<br>
To make myself appear as a convincing lyricist<p>

I rewrite each of the lines<br>
A hundred times I revise<br>
Finally succeed<br>
With the next song to devise.<p>
