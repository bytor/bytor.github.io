<font size=+3>GEDDY LEE -- RUSH</font><br>
<font size=+2>IT'S A GROOVE THING</font><br>
By John Stix<p>

<em>
18 albums into its career, Rush continues to explore new sounds and 
styles.  <strong>Roll the Bones</strong> has a taste of rap, a bit of funk, and a 
bigger "groove" than we've come to expect from this Canadian trio.  Neil 
Peart has chosen to be more straight-ahead, leaving room for Geddy Lee's 
bass playing to be more aggressive.  And while he's stepping out on the 
bass, the absence of keyboards puts Alex Lifeson's guitar on center 
stage for the first time in a long while.  As the band prepared for a 
major tour, Geddy was eager to talk about how all these changes have 
occurred.<p></em>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  <strong>Roll the Bones</strong> is your clearest example of a rock trio 
record, damn the keyboards.  There's also more bass playing.<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  Right.  Well, that's interesting.  I went with such a different 
bass tone on this album.  I use a new WAL bass.  It's got a slightly 
richer tone.  I decided to get rid of some of the twang and get into 
being in the lower ranges, just grooving with the bass drum a bit more.  
I've gone back and forth as to whether people would take it as not 
enough bass on this record, or 'where did the twang go?'  I was hoping 
that people would appreciate the fact that it's a more subtle approach.  
But at the same time, there's a lot of real activity going on, and 
grooving with the bass drum.  I have a lot of fun playing bass on this 
record, and there's a lot of stuff happening with the drums.  It's 
interesting that you honed in on that.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  You filled a lot more holes than you have in the recent past.<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  I really got into grooving on this record.  There are a few 
times where the bass approach is more subtle, to let the song be, rather 
than to push myself up too forward.  There are other times where we just 
ram it.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  The clarity of the mix is excellent.  Everybody has his own 
sonic space.  Alex said a lot of it was designed into the songs.<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  To me, that's the way to do it.  If you have to fix something in 
the mix, that means there's something wrong with the arrangement.  The 
more experienced we get at making records, the more we appreciate the 
placements.  That's also something that we learned a lot from Steven 
Tayler, the engineer we've worked with on the last two records.  That 
is, when you're doing an overdub, really examine its purpose.  What is 
the range, musically?  Where is it going to slot in?  Not only the part, 
but the sound of it.  Does it have its own place?  Is it serving enough 
of a purpose to take up that much space on the track?  It's about 
building the track up so that everything does have its own place, and it 
becomes an arrangement thing.  In the past, we've put all kinds of cool 
stuff on, and then tried to juggle to get it all in there, and sometimes 
you just can't, because you've got too many things sharing the same 
place.  It's like, there's not enough room for all you guys in here!  
It's very hard, at one stage in your life, to accept that you can't put 
five great ideas on one song, 'cause if they're all great ideas, why 
shouldn't you be able to use them all?  The fact of the matter is, you 
can only appreciate maybe two of the five, so don't get precious about 
it, and make sure that the fundamental things are there, and the things 
that really serve the song best are there.  Remove the other ones.  It's 
not a crime to remove them.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Will you save those for a rainy day, or try to place them 
elsewhere, 'cause they were great ideas?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  No.  You've got to have confidence that there'll always be 
another great idea coming down the road, so don't worry about it.  Make 
sure  the song sounds great, and you've accomplished the goal.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Was there a reason you felt that you groove more with the drums 
on this?  Is that something that you knew going in?  Is it something you 
wanted to do that you haven't in a while?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  No, it just happened.  Obviously, the tempos the songs were 
written at, and the way the drum parts developed, go hand in hand into 
making the song groove the way it did.  But I didn't really expect it to 
be such an easy groove, especially considering how quickly everything 
came together.  The rhythm tracks of bass and drums were basically done 
in four days, which is unheard of for us, and unheard of for a lot of 
bands.  That, again, was the result of having solid rehearsal time 
beforehand.  Pre-production paid off in spades for us.  We spent ten 
weeks pre-producing, got all our arrangements and writing done in 
advance, had time left over for just plain rehearsal, where I would take 
the drum tracks and be able to play on my own, and we were playing real 
well just grooving together.  When the tracks went down so quickly, we 
looked at each other, 'Uh-oh, something's wrong.  We recorded too 
quickly.  That must mean the songs were too simple.'  But I think it was 
that we were just more prepared than we expected ourselves to be.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Where did the funk of "Roll the Bones" come from?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  I think there are grooves that you always want to play with, and 
I intentionally wanted to write a few more than usual songs at a kind of 
mid-tempo.  I think that was a good kind of limitation, because in a 
way, it forces you to examine that tempo, more than we have in the past.  
To keep every song different from the other, you've got to play around 
with slightly different feels, and Alex and I locked into this funk, and 
I use the word very tentatively.  We're talking about three white guys 
from Canada, you know.  So we have this section that was relatively 
funky for a rock context, and we really liked the way it grooved.  Neil 
had also given me some samples to work with in my drum machine.  He 
assembled a few rhythmic patterns that were very funky, 'cause we talked 
about at some point doing something that had a bit of that kind of edge 
to it.  So we used them when writing the song, and it really paid off.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  You played with funk ideas on the instrumental, "Where's My 
Thing."<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  That was actually written to a basic four on the floor bass drum 
beat.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  I heard Neil was asking for an instrumental.<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  We kept saying to him, "We're gonna write an instrumental on 
this record," and he goes, "Great!"  That started on <strong>Presto</strong>.  Every 
time we got halfway through it, I could see in the corner of my eyes 
this lyric that really suited the part, so it's like, 'All right, never 
mine, the instrumental can wait.'  So this time, we kept it up and 
finally he said, 'Look guys, no more lyrics until you write it.  Get it 
together!"  So we said, "All right."  It could have been a song, but we 
kind of left it as a challenge of being a good instrumental track.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Is this your WAL bass?  At one point you used the producer's 
bass.<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  That was way back on <strong>Power Windows</strong>.  I used Peter Collins' 
WAL.  That was the first time I used it.  Subsequently, every record 
past that was my own WAL.  But this time, we had another WAL that I had 
ordered, and it had a slightly larger body, and I figured the biggest 
sound difference is 'cause it's a red color (laughter).  I plugged in, 
and it sounded different.  It still had all the right WAL 
characteristics, but it had a little deeper, more resonant bottom end.  
I loved playing it.  It felt really good and gave instant gratification 
on the bottom end.  So I thought, 'Screw it, let's go in this direction, 
sound-wise.  Let's have a slightly thicker sound.'<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Is the basis of the sound direct to the board with a bit of 
cabinet?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  Most of the sound is DI, and I used the small Gallien-Krueger 
amp, miked.  Surprisingly, I used that for more bottom than for top, 
because I find that WAL has top to spare, and with a little bit of EQ 
magic you can get all the twang you need.  I used the little amp just to 
get the air moving, so you've got that kind of 'real' bottom end, air 
moving.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Why wouldn't you use a 15 or 18 inch speaker?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  It's excessive.  I don't think you need that.  You just need a 
little bit of air movement.  With a good engineer, you can get it out of 
a small speaker.  I think it's too out of control to try to record those 
huge speakers, myself.  You get a lot of overtones, undertones, and all 
kind of stuff moving around.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  When you're recording your bass and drums, is Alex also playing 
in the room?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  No.  Usually we build a bed track of guides, where I'll lay my 
SMPTE keyboard track down, beginning to end.  Actually, this time we 
saved a lot of trouble and a lot of time because the arrangements 
changed so little from the demo stage to the album.  We actually used 
the demos, stripped them on a piece of digital tape, and had the demo 
bass, guitar and keyboards and vocals all on a couple tracks, and Neil 
played to the tracks.  Then I'd go in and redo my bass.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  You don't have to worry about live headphone mixes and you have 
a solid thing going through for Neil.<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  Yeah.  The three of us haven't played live since <strong>Power 
Windows</strong>, and even on <strong>Power Windows</strong> it lasted about two songs, and 
then we decided to go this other route.  Peter Collins introduced this 
technique to us, that is by far, from Neil's point of view, the best way 
to record Neil.  He works much better under pressure, and he's so 
prepared that it's a lot more concentrated to be able to just focus on 
him.  Give him the track, and nine times out of ten, he does it on one 
take.  It's like, 'Here's your track.  You don't have to worry about how 
the bass performance was, or if the guitarist screwed up, or whatever.  
Just go for it.'  He really likes that.  If he screws up in one section, 
he can easily drop in and drop out.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  On the liner notes you give thanks to the birds.  What's that?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  I've become a birdwatcher in the last few years.  Outside of our 
window at the rehearsal hall, there were some dilapidated birdfeeders, 
and I made sure we fixed them up, and started putting feed in them.  It 
was just a glorious thing to look at, as you're writing.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Do you guys write on command more than waiting for the bubble 
of inspiration?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  I work best under pressure, and I don't mind doing it like that.  
For me, it's important to have my batteries charged.  Writing on the 
road used to be a necessity.  To do it now would be really hard.  It 
could be done if I had to do it.  I feel much better having a break from 
everything.  It's a motivational thing.  When you finish a tour and come 
home to a couple months of rest, you're dying to get back to work.  To 
me, that enthusiasm is worth its weight in gold.  So give me a couple 
months off, give me a date to go in, and I'll just start writing.  Then, 
to me, the whole album becomes a time capsule, a photograph of that 
point in your life, musically and emotionally.  I really like that idea.  
It's like a test.  What are you going to do?  What have you been going 
through; how will it come out?  From now on, when I hear those songs, I 
think back to what we were going through as people, as musicians, where 
our influences were, what we were thinking.  Sometimes you think, 'How 
could I have been thinking that?'<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Do you work on one song at a time, as opposed to finding a cool 
part, but it worked better in song D?<p>

Sometimes that happens, and sometimes you get the verse and the chorus, 
and you leave it, because you've got that song so far.  I like things to 
happen naturally.  In the past, I used to sit with a song that was 
cleverly arranged and had a lot of work done on it, but it sounded like 
you had a lot of work done on it.  Most of <strong>Hemispheres</strong> is like that.  
It's hard to think of one off the top of my head, but there are a number 
of songs that have been like that.  Whereas now, I think we have a 
little more confident and relaxed approach.  We'll go 'I'm happy with 
the way this verse is working.  It's going in the right direction.  
Let's put it back and get something else started.'  The we come back to 
it with a fresh ear, and suddenly it seem very obvious.  One thing Neil 
always says, "When you know what you've got to do next, it's a great 
time to stop."  It's great to come back into it the next day with a 
real good starting point, and you're fresh.  I like to work first thing 
in the morning.  To me, the most creative time is after breakfast.  I'm 
just chomping at the bit to get in there and start working.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Does Alex work at that time, too?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  Usually I'm sitting in the studio waiting for him to finish his 
exercises, so I get a head start on it.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  He told me he thinks he's waited about five six days for all 
the 10 or 15 minutes you're late.<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  It's a combination, because when a song starts taking a 
particular direction, he's got to take a break.  I'm usually doing all 
the computer operating, so when I'm doing an arrangement, the poor guy 
usually gets a half an hour of inspiration, and then he has to go out 
and watch TV for 20 minutes.  He can't stand to sit in there while I'm 
organizing all this stuff.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  What are you putting on computer?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  I put the entire arrangement on.  I use a drum machine for 
setting a very basic drum pattern, for verse, chorus, and bridge for the 
whole song.  I have it arranged from beginning to end, and whether it's 
got keyboards in it or not, I put down SMPTE code.  We tie that to an 8-
track tape recorder, and that's how we write.  We've got the entire 
arrangement on 8-track.  Once we decide where the verses, bridges, 
choruses all go, I spend the next hour pulling my hair out using 
computer arranging to actually throw the arrangement down there so that 
we have it.  Now we can work on the guitar parts, bass parts and vocal 
parts in detail.  Once the fundamental is written, we go back and 
rewrite, to make sure, 'Okay, this IV chord inversion could be more 
interesting,' or 'The vocal could be layered here.  I'll try double-
tracking, or some harmonies.'  We basically build the whole arrangement.  
On this album, it changed surprisingly little from that 8-track version 
to the final album version.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  Historically, keyboards have been much stronger in Rush.  Alex 
said the keyboards would be all on there, and he had to find a spot 
around them.  Were you aware the keys once took up so much space?<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  Not to the degree that we became aware of it later.  To me it 
was a new toy, a new texture.  It was very much a contemporary attitude 
in record making at the time, and something that I was interested in and 
wanted to learn from, and that we all wanted to have on the record.  
The mistake we made was not in getting into keyboards that heavily; the 
mistake was doing them first.  The mistake Alex made at that time was 
not being prepared with solid guitar parts before we did the keyboard 
overdubs.  You have to realize that he would write a very basic way, so 
he would have temporary parts worked out by the time we went in to 
record the keyboards.  That was his mistake, because there was too much 
open in the music.  If he would have done the preparation back then that 
he does now, which is an incredible amount of preparation, there would 
have been less room to do keyboard stuff on, because that would have 
been a definite part.  There were a lot of things that were indefinite 
coming from his side of things.  He wasn't prepared enough, early on.  
Whereas everybody else had their parts worked out.  That left it open 
for this onslaught of keyboards.  So, it was a two-way street there.  
The mistake was not having the guitar parts more definite.  Part of the 
responsibility lies on the band for not doing things differently, part 
of it lies on him for leaving things till later.  But when we realized 
that, we changed the approach, because all along, we considered 
ourselves very much a guitar band, and there definitely was no way we 
wanted to push the guitars out.  It just kind of happened.<p>

<strong>Guitar:</strong>  <strong>Roll the Bones</strong> makes use of keyboards for textures, to smooth 
it out at some points, or add tension and release.<p>

<strong>Geddy:</strong>  That's what we were after.  I'm glad it came off that way.  When 
Alex and I are writing, we generally write the bass, guitar, and vocals.  
That's generally our way of writing, and if the song starts becoming 
monotonous, we go, 'Okay, let's pull out another thing from our arsenal.  
Let's try the same thing, but let's try it from to keyboard point of 
view.  Maybe it'll give us another place to go to.'  I feel good about 
the way we've been working.<p>
