<font size=+1>RUSH COMES ACROSS LOUD AND CLEAR</font><br>
<b>by Mark McGonigle</b><p>

With Science-fiction like music and the high voice of lead singer Geddy Lee,
the rock group Rush seems to be a cross between Yes and Alvin and the
Chipmunks... with the volume turned up.<p>

The searlingly loud music which filled the outdoor ampitheater at the
Allentown fairgrounds for almost three hours last night during the Pat Travers
and Rush concert would be incomprehensible in any enclosed space.  The two
groups, who finished their tour together last night, have at least one thing
in common -- their belief in playing rock music at its loudest.<p>

The Pat Travers band opened the show with "Gonna Rock and Roll Tonight" a
number which immediately let the predominantly teen-age audience know this was
no place for the faint-hearted.  Althought the next song was entitled "Gettin
Better,"  it had nothing to do with the show, which stayed at the same low
level until Rush came onto the stage.<p>

But the crowd didn't seem to mind, and when the group played their hit single,
"Boom, Boom, Out Go the Lights," the audience enthusiastically joined in.<p>

One of the last songs the group performed was called, "Hammerhead." which it
is only fair to mention.  The number contained a  drum solo which would have
been the best part of that half of the concert if it hadn't been for two
concert-goers who provided a more entertaining diversion.  The two tried to
put up a sign welcoming Rush to the Lehigh Valley on the side of a trailer
near the stage.  With their unintentional Laurel and Hardy antics in
attempting to get the sign hung correctly, these two definitely provided the
most entertaining moments of the first act.<p>

Rush is a rock group with a little more finesse than the Pat Travers Band.
The music was not as loud or maybe my ears had just been sufficiently numbed,
and the group had somewhat more coherence.
