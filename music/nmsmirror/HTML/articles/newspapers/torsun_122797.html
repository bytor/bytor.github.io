<font size=+1>Rush retro CD takes in best of three decades</font><br>
<b>by Andrew Flynn</b><p>

Geddy Lee's wail, Alex Lifeson's blazing guitar
licks and Neil Peart's furious drumbeats -- these are the signatures of
Canada's foremost rock dignitaries. <p>

After almost 30 years, Rush has found its way into the international
pantheon of hard rock: a Canuck power trio who earned their stripes
through hard work and a technical prowess that awed fans and fellow
musicians alike. <p>

"We started the band when we were 15 years old," Lifeson said in a
recent interview from his home north of Toronto. <p>

"So it's been such a part of our lives -- it's been our lives -- and
everything has been centred around it for all these years." <p>

To celebrate their longevity, the band's record company has released a
retrospective on two separate CDs, featuring remastered Rush originals
from albums released between 1974 and 1987. <p>

"Listening to this retrospective, I guess I realized maybe how important
Rush was and is," says Lifeson. <p>

"It's unique, in that there aren't too many bands around that have had
that kind of history." <p>

And they don't call Rush the ambassadors of Canadian rock for nothing. <p>

They broke new ground for Canadian bands in the '70s and '80s by
being the first hard rock act to make it big south of the border. Unlike
other Canadians such as Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, Rush chose to
return to their home and native land. <p>

"In 1974 when we had our first American tour and (album) release, that
really opened a lot of doors," Lifeson says. <p>

"We worked so hard, we spent so much time down there that we showed
there was something that Canada had to offer in terms of music on an
international scale." <p>

It wasn't until the late '70s that Canadian artists such as Loverboy and
Bryan Adams began to crack the American market. The fact that Rush had
already been there gave them a leg up, Lifeson says. <p>

"Perhaps we just opened the door a little bit -- or at least unlocked it --
and made it a little bit easier. <p>

"Before that it was very difficult to get anything happening in the states.
Bands like The Guess Who and B.T.O. (Bachman Turner Overdrive), of
course, were successful on a certain level down there. But I think they
were gone by mid-'75 -- nothing really lasted very long." <p>

Official recognition of Rush's status as a national treasure came earlier
this year when the trio -- also noted for raising millions of dollars for
charity -- were awarded one of the country's highest honors, the Order of
Canada. <p>

They are the only rockers to be given the medal of distinction in its
30-year history. <p>

"Something about our home country has kept us here and moments like
this make you feel like you've made the right decision," Lee said after
receiving his medal. <p>

While this year has been a time for Rush to reflect on their career, it was
also marked by terrible tragedy when Peart's 19-year old daughter Selena
was killed in a car accident in August. <p>

Her death was a great shock to Peart, his family and the band. In
deference to Peart, says Lifeson, Rush has put itself on hold for now. <p>

"He needs time right now and so do the rest of us. We'll make sure he
gets it." <p>

Lifeson, Lee and Peart have always been good friends. Part of the
formula for their success has been good communication and respect; Rush
has never fallen victim to the petty squabbling that has destroyed other
bands. <p>

"We've always been lucky: we've never had any of those internal
problems," says Lifeson. <p>

"It's very rare. We've worked with so many bands and seen so much
stupid infighting and silly little games that people will play." <p>
