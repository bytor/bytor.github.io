Free concerts in these parts are hard to come by these days. When they do 
occur, they usually feature some local band that's just there as a background 
type of entertainment. But to catch a glimpse of a couple of up and coming 
groups merely for the blessing of being a student of ISU makes going to school 
here a good deal.<p>

Although Head East and Rush are not full-fledged starts yet, their names are
on the lips of occultists everywhere. Rush has just debuted their fourth album
"2112" and their presence Friday says quite a bit for the continuity of power
trio rockers.<p>

Rush got off to a slow start, with most of the audience not knowing how to
take Geddy Lee's lead vocals. Although he sounds like a cross between Beverly
Sills and Robert Plant, his vocal musicianship goes well with the versatile
guitar of Alex Lifeson.<p>

Lifeson had a tough job, as does any guitarist in a power trio, because he has
to play rhythm, lead and be expected to vary his style with certain sound
alterations and effects. He did this quite well, offering enough variation and
demonstrating an expertise which would not be so adaptable for just any
guitarist. On the movement "2112," a rock symphony which occupies an entire
side from the latest album, Lifeson manages to coordinate the rock rhythm and
lead in such a way as to convey well placed feeling reminiscent of more
classical modes, but adapted to the electric guitars of hard rock.<p>

Head East on the other hand, are players of a celebratory form of music. With
the musical help of keyboardsmen Roger Boyd, they have further rounded out
their sound to include more sophisticated rock movements striving for a wider
appeal than the rockers, Rush.<p>

Lead vocalist Michael Somerville also helped move the action as well with his
down-on-the knee gestures reminiscent of Al Jolson. He kept the audience busy,
moving around and occasionally dipping into the audience to shake a few
hands.<p>

However, there was a rather poor audio mix which made the instruments sound
like an indiscernable musical mass and didn't let the talents of people, like
guitarist John Schlitt, shine through.<p>

Nevertheless, the audience quite approved of Head East's performance, calling
them back for four encores, despite the imploringly uncalled for action of
keyboardsmen Boyd, who screamed for the concertgoers to get up off their
"fat-asses." All in all, it was like a homecoming for a group from these parts
who made good and look like they're going someplace. Head East. Our Boys.<p>

The idea of a free concert was a good one and is a great way to introduce the
students to what promises to be a good schedule of popular music for the
months to come. With their new album, Rush offers an alternative to standard
rock-ism while we can only speculate as to what Head East will do with their
new found popularity and how they will handle their responsibility
thereof.<p>
