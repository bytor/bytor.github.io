Some of the tabs here are incorrect, and because I'm not a musician I have
no idea which ones or what they should be. So instead of looking here, you
should bounce over to the 
<a href="http://deadbeast.net/rtp/">Rush Tablature
Project</a>. They have a ton of tabs, and links to tabs by other bands as
well.<p>

However, if you feel some reason you absolutely NEED to see the tabs housed
at syrinx, click <a href="tabs2.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/tabs2.html">here</a>.<p>
