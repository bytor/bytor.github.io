<em>April 28, 1992</em>
<p>

Well, I was only a kid<br>
Didn't know enough to turn away.<br>
Needed cash,<br>
But couldn't find another way.<br>
Nothing to lose.<br>
Gonna learn the fast food trade<br>
The way the Big Mac fries.<p>

Well, I was only a kid<br>
With a mop in my hand.<br>
Geeky look.<br>
Weird colors on a human gland.<br>
Taking orders<br>
For food that tastes really bland<br>
'Til I get my butt canned.<p>

<dl>
CHORUS<br>
<dd>
        Cooking up fries.<br>
        I cannot wait 'til break time<br>
        Serving up food<br>
        And hoping that nobody dies<br>
        Burgers on fire<br>
        Looking for a fire extinguisher<br>
        Spritzing the grill<br>
        The way the Big Mac fries.<p>
</dd></dl>

Well, I was only a kid<br>
Rushing 'round in a trance<br>
Hiding from friends<br>
Making fun at my circumstance<br>
I wanted Rush tickets<br>
But I only had three bucks in my pants<br>
The way the Big Mac fries.<p>

Well, I was only a kid<br>
Had to trash all my plans<br>
I'm still broke<br>
Working at this burger stand<br>
Looking for heaven<br>
And an on-the-job romance<br>
But I work with three Stans<p>

REPEAT CHORUS<p>

Patties round<br>
Frying on a silver grill<br>
Taking no chances on these suckers burning<br>
And the noon rush hour begins<br>
Rushing 'round<br>
Putting food on plastic trays<br>
Feeling dejected at pay unexpected<br>
Less than $2.75 for an hour<br>
The way the Big Mac fries.<p>
