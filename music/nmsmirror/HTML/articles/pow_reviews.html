<strong>From Rolling Stone -- 1985</strong></font><br>
<em>by David Fricke </em><p>

    While critics routinely dismissed Rush as pretentious operatic
heavy-metal bozos, this indeftigable Canadian trio was actually busy
becoming the Police of power rock. On their recent studio LPs,
leading up to 1984's appropriately titled <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong>,
they tightened up their sidelong suites and rhythmic abstractions
into balled-up song fists, art-pop blasts of angular, slashing
guitar, spatial keyboards and hyperpercusion, all resolved with
forthright melodic sense.<p>
    "The Big Money," the first hot FM focus track from <strong>Power
Windows</strong>, may be the best of Rush's Cool Wave experiment to date.
Neil Peart whips up a Molotov drum cocktail that is half Stewart
Copeland psycho-ska and half "Blitzkrieg Bop"; from deep within his
Edge-like echo pit, guitarist Alex Lifeson opens fire witha metallic
descending chord sequence that rips through the song's chrome-finish 
production like grapeshot. In "Territories," a simple
disco-style pulse becomes a Lifeson-spurred gallop, his Chinese
gutar chater alternating with the telegrahpic synth patterns and
sheet-metal keyboards played by singer-bassist Geddy Lee.<p>
    To most U2 and Simple Minds fans, these may not seem like major
advances. There are moments when <strong>Power Windows</strong> sounds too much
like the sum of its Eighties inspirations -- that ghostly U2
resonance, the Police-like mesh of multirhythms and ping-pong dub
effects. Yet Rush, no doubt responidng to familiar impulses, revs up
these songs with brute metal force. Lifeson's solo in "Grand
Designs" teeters on white noise, his demon strokes dissolving into
feedback howls and strangled vibrato, while Peart and Lee subdivide
the beat into frenzied algebra.<p>
    This is not a case of old Seventies arena-rock dogs fudging new
tricks. Rush remains faithful to vintage progressive aesthetics but
has accepted the challenge of the postpunk upheaval and made notable
adjustments. "Manhattan Project" is the first song about the A-bomb
that successfullly combines Genesis-like grandeur, real strings and
a breakaway middle a la Siouxsie and the Banshees at full throttle.
Lee has also toned down his keening shriek to a more accessible
tenor; Peart, the group's uncompromising lyricist, has streamlined
his verse to pithy effect. <p>
    None of this is likely to impress the New Wave in crowd, which
is their loss. Because <strong>Power Windows</strong> may well be the missing link
between Yes and the Sex Pistols.<p>
