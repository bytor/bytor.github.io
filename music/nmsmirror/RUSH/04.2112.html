<font size=+1><strong>Hugh Syme on the symbolism of the Man and Star</font>
</strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Hugh Syme (Creem 1983): </strong>"What I did do with that 
particular cover was read their lyrics, and
understand that there is a good force and a bad force: the good force was
music, creativity, and freedom of expression-and the bad force was anything
that was contrary to that.</dd><P> 

<dd>"The man is the hero of the story.  That he is nude is just a classic
tradition ... the pureness of his person and creativity without the trappings
of other elements such as clothing.  The red star is the evil red star of the
Federation, which was one of Neil's symbols.  We basically based that cover
around the red star and that hero.</dd> <P> 

<dd>"Now, that hero and that kind of attitude about freedom of expression and the
band having that kind of feeling ... at the time, it never ready occurred to
me, to be honest with you, that they would adopt it quite so seriously as a
logo.  Because it's appeared just about everywhere, thereafter."</dd>

<dl>
<strong><font size=+1>Geddy on the man/star symbol</font></strong><br><br>

<dd><strong>Geddy Lee (1983 interview): </strong>"Hugh Syme designed that.  
Once he received the lyrics for 2112 and
heard some of the music and know what the album was, sortof, what 
direction the album was going, and he designed the graphics to go along
with it and he came up with the design.  It sorta comes to us to sort of
stand for individualism, sorta man against the masses."</dd>

<font size=+1><strong>Neil Peart on the symbol</font></strong><br><br>

<dd><strong>Neil Peart (Creem 1982): </strong>"All it means is the abstract 
man against the mass [sic]. The red star symbolizes any collectivist 
mentality."</dd>

<font size=+1><strong>Where did the story of "2112" come from?</font></strong>
<br><br>

<dd><strong>Neil Peart (Dec 2, 1991 "Rockline" interview): </strong>
"The inspiration behind it was ...  It's difficult always to trace those
lines because so many things tend to coalesce, and in fact it ended up
being quite similar to a book called <STRONG>Anthem</STRONG> by the writer 
Ayn Rand.  But I didn't realize that while I was working on it, and then 
eventually as the story came together, the parallels became obvious to me 
and I thought, 'Oh gee, I don't want to be a plagiarist here.'  So I did give 
credit to her writings in the liner notes." </dd></dl><p>

<em>Anonymous, 2112</em><br>
<dd>"I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become
one, merging into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey.  The Twin
Moons, just two pale orbs as they trace their way across the steely sky. I
used to think I had a pretty good life here, just plugging into my machine
for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple Paper in the
evening.
<P>
My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes
of the Outer Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving
planets were banded together under the Red Star of the Solar Federation.
The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.
<P>
I believed what I was told. I thought it was a good life, I thought I was
happy. Then I found something that changed it all..."</dd></dl>

<strong>I. Overture</strong>
"And the meek shall inherit the earth."

<strong>II. Temples of Syrinx</strong>
... "The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every
Federation city.  I have always been awed by them, to think that every single
facet of every life is regulated and directed from within!  Our books, our
music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the
priests..."

We've taken care of everything
The words you hear the songs you sing
The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes.

It's one for all and all for one
We work together common sons
Never need to wonder how or why.

We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls.
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls.

Look around this world we made
Equality our stock in trade
Come and join the Brotherhood of Man
Oh what a nice contented world
Let the banners be unfurled
Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand.

We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
Our great computers fill the hallowed halls.
We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
All the gifts of life are held within our walls.

<strong>III. Discovery</strong>
... "Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath
the cave, I found it.  I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up,
holding it reverently in my hands.  I had no idea what it might be, but it was
beautiful" ...
... "I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make
them sound differently.  As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced
my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music!  How different it could be
from the music of the Temples!  I can't wait to tell the priests about it! ..."

What can this strange device be?
When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
It's got wires that vibrate and give music
What can this thing be that I found?

See how it sings like a sad heart
And joyously screams out its pain
Sounds that build high like a mountain
Or notes that fall gently like rain.

I can't wait to share this new wonder
The people will all see its light
Let them all make their own music
The Priests praise my name on this night.

<strong>IV. Presentation</strong>
... "In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of
grim, expressionless faces.  Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent
voice echoed throughout the silent Temple Hall." ...
... "Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet
rejection!  Instead of praise, sullen dismissal.  I watched in shock and horror
as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet..."

I know it's most unusual
To come before you so
But I've found an ancient miracle
I thought that you should know

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you.

Yes, we know it's nothing new
It's just a waste of time
We have no need for ancient ways
The world is doing fine

Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan.

I can't believe you're saying
These things just can't be true
Our world could use this beauty
Just think what we might do.

Listen to my music
And hear what it can do
There's something here as strong as life
I know that it will reach you.

Don't annoy us further
We have our work to do.
Just think about the average
What use have they for you?

Another toy will help destroy
The elder race of man
Forget about your silly whim
It doesn't fit the plan.

<strong>V. Oracle: The Dream</strong>
... "I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me.  Clearly
yet I see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the
staircase" ...
... "I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure
spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world.  I was overwhelmed
by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a
way that had been crushed by the Federation long ago.  I saw now how
meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ..."

I wandered home though the silent streets
And fell into a fitful sleep
Escape to realms beyond the night
Dream can't you show me the light?

I stand atop a spiral stair
An oracle confronts me there
He leads me on light years away
Through astral nights, galactic days

I see the works of gifted hands
That grace this strange and wondrous land
I see the hand of man arise
With hungry mind and open eyes

They left the planet long ago
The elder race still learn and grow
Their power grows with purpose strong
To claim the home where they belong
Home, to tear the Temples down...
Home, to change..

<strong>VI. Soliloquy</strong>
... "I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my
total despair.  I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now.  I
can no longer live under the control of the Federation, but there is no other
place to go.  My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of
my dream, and know peace at last."

The sleep is still in my eyes
The dream is still in my head
I heave a sigh and sadly smile
And lie a while in bed
I wish that it might come to pass
Not fade like all my dreams

Just think of what my life might be
In a world like I have seen
I don't think I can carry on
Carry on this cold and empty life
Oh...noo.

My spirits are low in the depths of despair
My lifeblood spills over..

<strong>VII. The Grand Finale</strong>
Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation
Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation
Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation
We have assumed control.
We have assumed control.
We have assumed control.

A Passage To Bangkok
- ------- -- -------
Our first stop is in Bogota
To check Colombian fields
The natives smile and pass along
A sample of their yield
Sweet Jamaican pipe dreams
Golden Acapulco nights
Then Morocco, and the East,
Fly by morning light

We're on the train to Bangkok
Aboard the Thailand Express
We'll hit the stops along the way
We only stop for the best

Wreathed in smoke in Lebanon
We burn the midnight oil
The fragrance of Afghanistan
Rewards a long day's toil
Pulling into Katmandu
Smoke rings fill the air
Perfumed by a Nepal night
The Express gets you there

The Twilight Zone
--- -------- ----
A pleasant faced man steps up to greet you
He smiles and says he's pleased to meet you
Beneath his hat the strangeness lies
Take it off, he's got three eyes
Truth is false and logic lost
Now the fourth dimension is crossed

You have entered the Twilight Zone
Beyond this world strange things are known
Use the key, unlock the door
See what your fate might have in store
Come explore your dreams' creation
Enter this world of imagination

Wake up lost in an empty town
Wondering why no one else is around
Look up to see a giant boy
You've just become his brand new toy
No escape, no place to hide
Here where Time and Space collide

Lessons

Sweet memories  Flashing very quickly by
Reminding me  Giving me a reason why
I know that  My goal is more than a thought
I'll be there  When I teach what I've been taught

You know we've told you before
But you didn't hear us then
So you still question why
You didn't listen again

Sweet memories  I never thought it would be like this
Reminding me  Just how close I came to missing
I know that  This is the way for me to go
You'll be there  When you know what I know

Tears
-----
All of the seasons
And all of the days
All of the reasons
Why I've felt this way
So long
So long

Then lost in that feeling
I looked in your eyes
I noticed emotion
And that you had cried
For me
I can see

What would touch me deeper
Tears that fall from eyes
That only cry?
Would it touch you deeper
Than tears that fall from eyes
That know why?

A lifetime of questions
Tears on your cheek
I tasted the answers
And my body was weak
For you
The truth

Something For Nothing
--------- --- -------
Waiting for the winds of change
To sweep the clouds away
Waiting for the rainbow's end
To cast its gold your way
Countless ways
You pass the days

Waiting for someone to call
And turn your world around
Looking for an answer to
The question you have found
Looking for
An open door

You don't get something for nothing
You don't get freedom for free
You won't get wise
With the sleep still in your eyes
No matter what your dreams might be

What you own is your own kingdom
What you do is your own glory
What you love is your own power
What you live is your own story
In your head is the answer
Let it guide you along
Let your heart be the anchor
And the beat of your own song
