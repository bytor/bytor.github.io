<p>
Walkin' 'round the lot<br>
Lookin' for an SUV.<br>
A brand new Bravada<br>
Is the only thing good enough for me.<br>
If my dream is won<br>
Though all my loot is lost<br>
I will buy the truck,<br>
But I will not count the cost.<p>

My credit check has cleared,<br>
And my loan is denied.<br>
The debts are too heavy,<br>
Rating a little too fried.<br>
If my dad will cosign<br>
Though all my pride is lost,<br>
I will buy the truck,<br>
But I will not count the cost.<p>

And when the engine starts,<br>
that's 5 grand down the drain.<br>
60 months worth of payments,<br>
but will it be worth the pain?<p>

And if the truck remains<br>
Though all the value's lost,<br>
I will pay it off,<br>
but I will not count the cost.<p>
