Subdivisions
  from 'Signals'

---
Performance notes:
   Most of this song is 'power' chords.  There are really only 4 chords
in this song: F#, G, A, & Bm. [ Well, actually there is a D thrown in
right toward the end ] The solo sounds nice with a little bit of
flanger/phaser.  I think the time signature changes a few times
but I couldn't tell you where.  I know, however, that it starts
in 7/4.  As is usual, we assume that the reader has heard the song
and can pick out the specific rhythms by ear.
