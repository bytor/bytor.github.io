You may have heard a lot of talk about this cd, about how great the sound is.
It's put out by KTS, a name that bootleg collectors will recognize -- they are
notorious for putting out recordings of excellent sound quality. I've even
bought one trusting in the KTS name without hearing it first (I was not
disappointed either). You'd think this was the greatest bootleg ever. BUT (and
that's a very BIG but)...<p>

The recording was done at a slightly slower speed than the original. Best
estimates run at about 5%. Why it's slower, when taped from a radio broadcast
is anyone's guess, but it is. You might not notice it at first (I didn't, and
I even knew about it beforehand), but several songs into the disc and it makes
it nearly unlistenable. And unfortunately, not many have speed control on
their cd players. I'm honestly surprised that someone else hasn't taken this,
sped it up, and rereleased it.<p>

Packaging on this is decent, with several pictures taken from New Orleans (if
one believes the back of the cd), and the cover repeated again on the cd
itself.<p>

Although the sound quality is superior to most of the RTB boots, this is one
to pass up. The slowness of it will make you want to hit your cd player by the
time you get to "Freewill". Try Atmospheric instead, if you're looking for an
audience CD boot, or trade for it with someone who has sped it up and taped it
on normal speed.<p>
