<font size=+1>Rumbles of Rush tour launch reverberating in Greenville</font><br>
<b>by Lynne Lucas</b><p>

<em>
Canadian rock trio Rush - Neil Peart, Alex
Lifeson and Geddy Lee - has been taking advantage of its rental of
Greenville Memorial Auditorium, using the facility to rehearse for its tour,
which kicks off Saturday night in Greenville.</em><p>

The picture frames have been rattling off the walls at Greenville Memorial
Auditorium this week, as Canadian rock trio Rush is inside plowing through
rehearsal for its upcoming tour.<p>

Like .38 Special last year, Rush is kicking off its tour Saturday night in
Greenville, having booked pre-concert rehearsal time at the auditorium for a
few days before the show. The band has been rehearsing there since Tuesday
night, said Chip Gray, the auditorium's executive director -- and, as he'll
quickly attest, not exactly at soft volumes.<p>

Nor, exactly do Rush fans come in soft volumes.<p>

The first concert of the tour, which is in support of the band's new album
"Presto," sold out Wednesday, pulling in ticket buyers from as far away as
Canada, Detroit and Arkansas.<p>

Gray estimated that more than 1500 tickets (the auditorium holds 6800) were
nabbed by fans outside the area, including several dozen from Ohio.<p>

"We had one guy call from New Jersey to charge his tickets," said Gray.<p>

"And then he asked, 'Do you know where the bus station is in Greenville?'"<p>

The rabid fan club comes to hear drummer Neil Peart, guitarist Alex Lifeson
and vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee perform technically flawless yet emotionally
soul-less hard rock.<p>

The new album, the group's 17th album over the last 15 years, is receiving
more critical praise than many others in its discography.<p>

True, Peart's lyrics are literate and he's long been a drummer's drummer
because of his technical facility and fancy work. But between the
over-arrangement of the music and Lee's shrill and unconvincing vocals, it's
hard to find the heart.<p>

Those who flock hundreds of miles to hear a Rush concert and gobble up their
records must hear something different in the music.<p>

A sold out opening tour night is what every rock band dreams of and that's
one of the reasons several groups opt to launch tours in Greenville, said
Gray.<p>

"This place is so small for a rock show that it's a good bet to sell out,"
he said.<p>

"Pre-tour rehearsals at the auditorium look attractive because the building
is easy to work in and relatively inexpensive to rent," said Gray. "Area hotel
accommodations are reasonable, and it's a good market for rock 'n' roll," he
added.<p>

Opening the Feb. 17 Rush concert will be Mr. Big, a driving rock quartet
whose personnel has led to "supergroup" labels.<p>

The lineup is strong singer Eric Martin; gifted guitarist Paul Gilbert;
Billy Sheehan, who three times has been named "Guitar Player" magazine's top
rock bass player of the year; and touted session and tour drummer Pat
Torpey.<p>

Although the foursome often lapses into typical power rock pitfalls --
especially recycled riffs and the more-is-better school of presentation --
the combination of Martin's soulful voice and Gilbert's guitar work
sometimes catches fire.<p>

Mr. Big will make an appearance at Horizon Records Saturday afternoon.<p>

The band will be on hand 1-2:30 p.m. for "autographs and rock 'n' roll
talk," said store owner Gene Berger.<p>
