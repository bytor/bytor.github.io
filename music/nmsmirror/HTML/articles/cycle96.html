Somewhere along the greasy Mackenzie Highway leading to Yellowknife, Neil 
Peart, left, considers blowing his brains out.  Fortunately, his finger was 
unloaded.  Otherwise, Neil wouldn't have lived to tell us of his 
rainbow-blessed journey north, which included a climb on the Columbia 
Icefield (right).</em>

<br clear=all><p>

It was a dumb idea to begin with, and I blame myself. Brutus and I were 
planning a two week motorcycle tour of Western Canada, and I mentioned that 
it might be fun to go farther north.  Far enough, perhaps, to see the 
midnight sun.<p>

We scanned the map and checked distances. There weren't many choices; in the 
far north, roads are few and inhabited destinations limited. A tempting 
little line high on the map, the Dempster Highway, reaches all of the way 
to Inuvik. And the Arctic Circle.  But no, not this time. Same for Alaska or 
the Yukon -- we could never make it there and back in two weeks.<p>

Some fool suggested Yellowknife, and we started ciphering.  The return 
journey, with a few scenic tangents, would be about 13,000 km; allowing for a 
day in Yellowknife, this would mean averaging more than 900 km a day, one day 
after another. Factor in uncertain weather, mountains, some long and remote 
stretches of unpaved road in British Columbia and the Northwest Territories, 
various police forces interfering with our idea of a proper pace and 
mechanical difficulties, and it looked a little daunting.<p>

At the same moment we looked up from the map and nodded solemnly to each 
other. Yes, we would go north of 60 to catch some midnight rays.<p>

<hr width=30% align=center size=5><P>
<font size=+2>
Here's mud in your eye</font><p>

	Thus we set off on a long, hard journey, on our sport-touring BMWs --
great for the paved roads, but not for the other part of the route: A Thousand 
Miles of Dirt. And worse: heavy rain in the Northwest Territories would turn a 
construction zone into a quagmire, and send us and our bikes sprawling in the 
mud. It was then, as I lay in the muck smeared in greasy clay and looked at my 
fallen motorcycle, that I knew for sure.<p>

It was a dumb idea to begin with.  And I blamed Brutus.<p>

<hr width=30% align=center size=5><P>
<font size=+2>
Going nowhere, really fast</font><p>

As a general rule, we favor two-lane roads (with the odd passing lane), the 
choicest scenery (with a nice hotel and a good wine list nearby) and creative 
routing (meandering around the countryside for hundreds of kilometres, but 
still getting to the hotel by cocktail time).  Our official motto: "Taking 
forever/to go nowhere/really fast."<p>

This plan we put into effect.  On the move with the rising sun, usually by 6 
a.m., we made rapid progress while the roads were quiet and the world was 
still waking.  Breakfast would come later at a small-town diner.  In the first 
days we rounded Lake Huron and then the North Shore of Lake Superior, with 
its landscape of glacier-scoured rocks and windswept pines so beloved by 
Canadian landscape painters.<p>

Beyond Thunder Bay, a hot prairie wind replaced the cool lake breeze, and in 
Manitoba the forest drew back like a curtain.  The wide green prairie opened 
on every side and the world seemed like a disk, with 360 degrees of horizon.  
A quick stop at the BMW dealer in Winnipeg corrected a leaky gasket and a 
faulty electrical relay, and we continued west with fresh oil and filters.<p>

In Saskatchewan, a scenic loop through the Qu'Appelle River Valley lured us 
off the Trans-Canada.  On a sudden ridge, we stopped and looked out over the 
deep canyon, across to the ancient corrugated walls of the other side, and 
down to where a tiny tractor plowed up a long cloud of dust trailing in the 
still air.<p>

In this prairie province, the Qu'Appelle Valley is, for lack of much else, a 
significant geological feature.  The winding, grassy trails of a ski hill have 
even been carved into the valley wall.  Yet, on the whole, the Saskatchewan 
landscape doesn't seem flat exactly, but more rumpled and rippled-a wide green 
duvet.  As Brutus and I sped over the vast grid of empty roads, the fields of 
wheat and canola were bright from the early summer rains.  My helmet filled 
with the perfume of lilacs as we passed the isolated farm houses. In Melville, 
a line of freight cars waited by the towering grain elevators-a classic 
prairie scene. Over a tall glass of lemonade outside the Waverley Hotel, 
Brutus and I discussed how our gas mileage seemed to be radically diminished 
by these "prairie autobahns." Some quirk of the atmosphere, no doubt.<p>

<hr width=30% align=center size=5><P>
<font size=+2>
Westward ho</font><P>
Thunderstorms whipped the streets of Regina that night and kept us awake to 
watch the lightning play.  By dawn the prairie sky was clear, and the streets 
washed clean.  We headed out of town on to the Trans-Canada -- until Brutus ran 
out of gas, a hundred metres short of Chubby's gas station. it turned out his 
gas tank hadn't been seated properly when the relay was replaced, and now 
there were three full litres out of reach of the fuel pickup.  This would be 
corrected at the BMW dealer in Calgary, where we also collected some needed 
supplies -- more foam ear plugs, a radar detector for Brutus, a screw for my 
sunglasses and a good Japanese dinner with flasks of hot sake.<p>

After breakfast at Lake Louise (still one of the most beautiful places I've 
been) we headed north on the Columbia lcefields Parkway.  This was territory 
new to both of us, so we'd planned this day to allow time for scenic 
overlooks, hikes away from the road to view waterfalls or the turquoise waters 
of Lake Peyto framed among the snow-painted mountains.  Time was set aside 
for photos and videos, wildlife viewing (black bear, white-tailed and mule 
deer, moose, wild bighorn sheep, ravens, magpies), and a climb up the 
Athabasca Glacier (breathtaking, in both senses).<p>

<em>
The Columbia lcefields Parkway (above left) demanded time for hiking and 
wildlife spotting.  An angry-looking bison (above) at the side of the Liard 
Highway caused a moment's pause while heading toward the Northwest 
Territories.  Before the rain and mud there was dust, torrents of dust, on the 
long trail north across permafrost and muskeg.</em></center><p>

Jasper is a pleasant town catering to outdoors lovers, and from there we 
turned west, leaving at dawn.  Mist hung on the lakes and mountains, and a 
herd of mule deer, heavy-antlered stags, rested in the dew-soaked grass.  
Through the Yellowhead Pass, we rode below Mount Robson (highest peak in the 
Rockies), and on into the northern British Columbia interior.  The weather 
remained fickle, and eventually we decided that the only way to be prepared in 
B.C. was to wear our rainsuits all the time.  With our sunglasses.<p>

Through this remote area I had thought we could dispense with the radar 
detector.  It was a dumb idea, and I blame myself. Sure enough, near the middle 
of nowhere we were stopped and charged with exceeding the posted limit.  
Brutus gave me a verbal thrashing, and I deserved it.<p>

From Hazelton, a long road led away into the bush.  Paved at first, it faded 
to gravel, then became narrow and rough until finally we reached the 
Sportsman's Kispiox Lodge.  We checked into a nicely appointed little cabin -- 
my favorite kind of accommodation, but a vanishing species.  The swift-moving 
Kispiox River bustled between the trees, snow-dusted mountains rose in the 
distance and a sudden rainbow glowed in the south.  From its end came not a 
pot of gold, but a Harley, roaring into my photograph and away up the little 
gravel road.  We wondered what he was doing there; perhaps he rode by and saw 
our BMWs, and wondered the same about us.<p>

The Stewart-Cassiar Highway leads straight north to the Alaska Highway, and it 
was partly paved, and partly not.  The day was partly clear, and partly... 
not.  We wore our sunglasses... and our rainsuits.  Most of the traffic 
consisted of RVs, many of them traveling in wagon trains, either for safety in 
numbers, or because once they caught up with each other, none of them could 
pass (having the bulk and acceleration of a glacier).<p>

Near the end of the longest day yet -- more than 1,100 km -- we were treated 
to the best road yet: the Alaska Highway, east from Watson Lake in the Yukon.  
Now traveling against the flow of RVs, all heading "north to Alaska," we had 
the road to ourselves.  As my notes recount: "The road becomes a winding, fast 
delight, and the efficient.  All weariness, pain, and fatigue are totally 
forgotten, lost in the sheer delight of riding a challenging road through 
majestic mountains."<p>

After that, things turned wild.  The Liard Highway, a wide, straight gravel 
road, leads into the Northwest Territories (where it is called, more 
accurately, the Liard Trail), through uninterrupted stretches of low forest, 
alternately dark with spruce or bright with aspens.  This is the land of 
permafrost, without which this part of the north would be a desert-the earth, 
frozen year-round, holds enough water to support the muskeg swamps and scrub 
forest.<p>

Torrents of dust on the road forced us to ride well separated, and at one 
point I came upon Brutus stopped in the middle of the gravel, pointing ahead 
to a large black shape at the roadside.  "It's a bear," he said.  "What do you 
think we should do?"<p>

After a moment's consideration, I said "I'll ride by it really slowly, and you 
have the video camera ready when it starts chewing on my leg." When I pulled 
alongside, the bear sat up, faced me with its ears erect, then turned and 
bounced into the woods.<p>

Another time it was a bison, a huge, angry-looking bull with flies swarming 
around its red eyes.  Once again I rode by slowly, wondering what he would do, 
but the bison shook his massive head a couple of times and lumbered into the 
bush.<p>

Whenever we stopped for a break or to look at a waterfall, another kind of 
wildlife closed in: the infamous northern insects.  The big flies were called 
"bulldogs" by the locals, and seemed to be attracted by the heat of our 
motorcycles, while the clouds of mosquitoes were after our blood.<p>

<font size=+2>
Twenty kinds of mud</font><p>
It is said that the Inuit have 20 words to describe different types of snow, 
and soon we learned that unpaved roads are like that too.  Sometimes a 
hard-packed surface let us cruise easily at 80 or 100 km/h, while on other 
sections it felt as if we were surfing through the loose stones. if we looked 
far enough ahead, we could pick out the sweet spot -- the groove left by 
trucks -- and simply let our wheels follow it.  Sometimes the bikes would 
oscillate beneath us, fishtailing in rhythm, and we had to learn to conquer 
our instinct to hit the brakes or back off the throttle -- pour it on, as a 
dirt rider would, and you can ride on through.<p>

A ferry carried us over the Liard River to Fort Simpson, far enough north now 
that at 11:00 p.m. I was reading by the light from the window of my hotel room 
(which had a bullet hole in it), and watching kids play in the streets 
outside.  Next morning we were on the Mackenzie Highway, headed for 
Yellowknife, and that's when the rain started.<p>

After almost 300 km of wet gravel and bleak wilderness, during which we 
encountered a handful of other vehicles, a ferry carried us over the Mackenzie 
River (the ferries are replaced in winter by "ice bridges"; the trucks just 
drive across the frozen river, which has the safe load ratings posted on the 
shore).  The rain continued, harder now.<p>

Over lunch at the Snowshoe Inn in Fort Providence, passing truck drivers told 
us this was the first big rain since the snow had melted, back in April, and 
if we were headed for Yellowknife... they shook their heads.<p>

It seems no matter where you go in Canada, it's a two-season country: winter 
and construction.  The road's rutted clay surface was awash, and had the 
consistency of paint.  With our wide, relatively slick tires, it was like 
skidding around on a greased griddle, and we gushed slowly through deep, 
slippery trenches.  Brutus's back wheel caught a protruding boulder, and he 
went down, sliding to a stop with the bike on its side.  Slipping and dancing, 
I managed to park my bike on its centerstand and skate over to help him.  Once 
his bike was righted, with the loss of a mirror, I couldn't get moving 
again -- each of my wheels was caught in a different rut, and the back wheel 
spun uselessly, pushing me sideways down the road.<p>

Brutus came over to help, but it was all we could do just to stand up. Soon my 
bike was down in the muck, and I followed, flailing into the mud-wrestling 
pit.  A tractor-trailer driver had been hanging back, waiting for us to pull 
ourselves together, and as it came skidding up to us, I flagged him down and 
called up to ask him how long this lasted.  If it went on much longer, we 
might be facing defeat.<p>

"Maybe five clicks more," he told me, before trying to drive off, but he 
couldn't get the big rig moving again.  As Brutus and I half-rode, 
half-waddled in the other direction, the truck's drive wheels spun in the mud, 
and the truck went nowhere.  After stopping for me. I blamed myself, and I'm 
sure the truck driver did too.  No doubt he's still hoping to meet me 
sometime, on a dark highway.<p>

<hr width=30% size=5 align=center><p>

Midnight tan</font><p>
After a 10-hour struggle through the gravel and mud of the Mackenzie Highway, 
our first stop in Yellowknife was the spray wash, where we stood in our 
rainsuits and sprayed each other before we turned to the bikes.  The Explorer 
Hotel is a surprisingly luxurious high-rise on the edge of town, and its 
restaurant made an excellent reward for our sufferings: Arctic char, caribou 
and buffalo steak, fine wine, and a decadent finish of Cherries Jubilee and 
cognac.<p>

The next day we explored the city, hoping the bright sun and fresh breeze 
would dry out the Mackenzie Highway before we faced it again on our way back.  
Yellowknife's population is only about 12,000, but it's the centre of 
government and business for a huge territory (a million square miles, or 
one-fifth of Canada's area).  Along its tidy paved streets, modern buildings 
house branches of most of Canada's franchise stores.<p>

In contrast, the Old Town reflects the community's beginnings, with lanes that 
wind around a bay of Great Slave Lake.  Float planes still take off and land 
all day, serving hunters, remote settlements, mines, oil rigs and defense 
installations.  The rustic Wildcat Cafe and the Bush Pilot's Brew Club 
overlook the shore, and the daring exploits of the early bush pilots are also 
documented in the city's museum, which we visited before our appointment at 
the local Honda dealer.<p>

It was time for another oil change, which we could have done ourselves in the 
hotel parking lot, but in these enlightened times, what do you do with the 
used oil?  Also, playing in all that mud had gummed up something in my 
engine -- it backfired loudly all over town while rough-looking characters ran 
for cover -- and I hoped a mechanic might be able to help.  The dealer was 
mainly geared to ATVs and snowmobiles, but the capable young mechanic, Mark, 
was able to find a sticking cable and get my fuel-injection back in synch.<p>

After running on five or six hours sleep a night for a week, we were in bed 
early that evening, with our alarms set for midnight -- the summer solstice.  
When I called Brutus's room, his sleepy voice told me he'd already decided 
"fuggit" and turned off his alarm, but now he growled: "Okay, let's get it 
over with." Nice talk, with our goal finally at hand.  I tried to convince the 
night manager to let us on the hotel roof, but he claimed to have no key, so 
we went to the parking lot.  At the stroke of midnight, a hint of sun still 
gleamed on the horizon, and an unearthly twilight reflected on the nearby 
lakes.  We took it all in, got our souvenir photos and videos, and went 
happily back to bed.<p>

Ahead of us now was the long homeward journey, down through Alberta to the 
Peace River and Edmonton, where we would pick up new tires and brake pads, 
then east on the Yellowhead Highway through Saskatoon and more of 
Saskatchewan's wide green duvet.  Near Winnipeg, we would pick up the 
Trans-Canada again, but the sunshine would end at the Ontario border, and wind 
and rain would chase us the rest of the way home.<p>

After yet another thousand-kilometre day, with cold and rain and strong winds 
gusting off Lake Superior, we huddled in the Parkway Motel in Wawa, Ontario.  
We were deeply fatigued, chilled and wind-battered.  Wet clothing was spread 
everywhere to dry.  The Weather Channel talked about more cold, more wind, 
more rain.  A taxi delivered take-out pizza to our motel room.<p>

At the same moment we looked up and nodded solemnly to each other.  It had 
been a dumb idea to begin with.  I blamed myself.<p>

Brutus did too.<p>
