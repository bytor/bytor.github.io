Unlike any of the other boots that are copies of the GUP video soundtrack, 
this CD is missing "Witch Hunt", and probably should be avoided because of it.
It is a true copy of the soundtrack, with no "extra" songs thrown in from the 
ESL soundtarck.<p>

The first few songs sound perfect, but after that sound like they were 
recorded at too high a level, distoring Geddy's voice. The crowd is
overwhelming at times, but usually during the music. It also sounds as if it
was recorded from an LP, pops can be heard during the encore. There is a 
bad cut between "Closer to the Heart" and the encore, and some of YYZ is 
chopped off. Each part of the encore is indexed, but not very well: the 
track for "Temples" actually starts partway through "YYZ".<p>

The packaging isn't great; the cover is a picture taken straight from the
Hemispheres tourbook (many will recognize it as the cover of "Rush Through
Time"), and the two inside pictures are also from the Hemispheres era. The
back lists it as being live "during '89 tours", which is obviously
incorrect. "Finding My Way" is included in the encore, although not listed
(or indexed).<p>

This is a cd bootleg to very much pass up. If you want a full recording of the
GUP soundtrack, you should check out "Currently in Vogue" instead.<p>
