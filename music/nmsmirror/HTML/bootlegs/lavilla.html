Where else could you find 2112, Natural Science, Xanadu and La Villa
Strangiato on one cd? This is a must-have for collectors, not only in terms of
song selection but in terms of quality. It was originally a radio broadcast,
pressed into a bootleg double-LP entitled "Xanadu", and finally arrived in the
CD format. Packed with over 74 minutes of music, this CD is well worth the
money.<p>

There has been much confusion over the date of the original concert. This CD
lists it as March 29th, while the LP listed it as March 16th. Neither of
these dates is correct (as Rush was playing the East Coast at the time), and
are more likely the date(s) of the radio broadcast itself. The most accepted
date is February 14th -- this has been confirmed as the one of the three 
dates Rush played in St. Louis.<p>

Although the sound quality is excellent, there are two flaws. First, this CD
was recorded from the LP bootleg itself, and occasionally "pops" can be heard
in the songs (most notably "La Villa"). The second is that the show may sound
TOO good to some -- it sounds more like a studio album, with the crowd faded 
in and out at the appropriate moments, than a true live album. That, 
however, is a matter of personal choice.<p>

The biggest flaw in this CD is the packaging. The cover is a washed-out
picture of the band with bad exposure; it appears to have been taken during
the "Signals" tour, and not "Permanent Waves" (when the concert was recorded).
The CD booklet is not even a booklet, merely a single piece folded in half.
Inside there are three pictures, one of each band member, but again the
pictures are washed-out. The CD itself is plain. One plus is that unlike most
bootlegs, the songs have the correct titles and are in the order listed on the
CD.<p>

This show is the same as the bootleg "Spirit Of St. Louis".<p>

If you come across this CD in your hunts at the local record store, by all
means pick it up!<p>

I was thoroughly impressed with this one. The version of Natural Science was 
worth the price of admission. The sound quality is very good, surely a 
soundboard recording. ( A side note...how do these guys get access to the 
soundboard?) Over all I recommend this one.<br>

This is one of the boots I have thoroughly enjoyed over the
years. If there was one more criteria to review, for example
"song selection", I'd have to give it a 9+, because the
version of Natural Science and the rendition of 2112 on this
boot are just fantastic.<p>

The photographic quality of the liners are actually pretty
good, but as the original reviewer noted, why the hell did
they use Signals-era photos? Etc.<p>

The sound quality is, for its TIME, very very good. 1980,
originally put to LP, remastered onto CD, yep, I'd say they
did a decent job in the changeover. Only some static pops
and slight distortion that are near-invisible unless you're
listening for them prevent this disc from getting a higher
mark for sound.<p>

Would I buy it again? I sure would.<br>
