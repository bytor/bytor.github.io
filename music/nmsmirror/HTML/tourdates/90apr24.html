<font size=+1>Canadian trio Rush plays the Spectrum</font><br>
<b>By Scott Brodeur</b><p>

At least the light show and special effects were innovative at last night's
sold-out Rush concert at the Spectrum. The music sure wasn't.  <p>

One of the premier power trios of the progressive movement, Rush was
embraced by the album-oriented rock movement only to be shoved aside by the
MTV set. During its two-hour performance last night, the Canadian band,
which is still able to pack arenas, showed how badly its songs have curdled
with age. Suite-like numbers such as "Subdivisions," "Free Will" and "Tom
Sawyer," once staples of the FM airwaves, sounded as dated as the worst
Mersey beat sounds or '70s disco music.  <p>

Even the material the band showcased from its latest effort, <u>Presto</u>
(Atlantic), was laced with cobwebs. For instance, "Show Don't Tell" and
"Superconductor," with a few adjustments, could have fit onto early '80s
albums such as <u>Moving Pictures</u> or <u>Permanent Waves</u> almost
seamlessly.  <p>

Most disappointing, however, was the failure of drummer Neil Peart or
guitarist Alex Lifeson -- both revered in the past for their pioneering
musicianship -- to step out of the mix and offer anything exceptional.
Peart's drum solo was boring for the most part, while Lifeson's guitar was
consistently shrouded with cloudy, indistinctive tones.  <p>

Singer-bassist Geddy Lee, despite his shying away from some high notes, was
the top performer of the night. Aided by a bubble bath of vocal
enhancement, including lots of echo and taped background vocals, Lee's
voice was strong and less piercing than in the past.  <p>

The band was further saved by an extraordinary laser and light show as well
as other effects, including three-dimensional cartoons and interesting
videos, that were worked into the show. Another extra was the placement of
two additional sets of speakers above the rear of the floor that provided a
stereo sound when used.  <p>

The show, with opening band Mr. Big, will repeat on Friday. Tickets are
$18.50.
