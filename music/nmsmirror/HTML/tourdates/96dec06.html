<font size=+1>MARATHON CONCERT A REAL RUSH
</font><br>
<strong>By Keith Spera</strong>, Music writer<p>

   Most music fans have at least one band that played a crucial role in their
formative years, and thus earned a permanent place on their list of all-time
favorites.  For me, that band is Rush.<p>
   So I pretty much checked my objectivity at the door of the UNO Lakefront
Arena Friday night before joining fellow hard-core fans -- young baby boomers
and old generation x-ers, mostly white, mostly male -- on the arena floor.
Having attended seven consecutive Rush tours since 1984, I can only judge the
show from the perspective of someone intimately familiar with the band's
output.  And compared to past outings, this was one of the most energized sets
that I've experienced, deftly showcasing the trademark mix of brains and brawn
that Rush acolytes revel in.<p>
   With no opening act, drummer Neil Peart, guitarist Alex Lifeson and
bassist/vocalist/keyboardist Geddy Lee served up a generous two-and-a-half
hours of music that drew from most of their 16 studio albums.  Longtime fans
were treated to two notable surprises: for the first time, the band presented
the 10-minute "Natural Science" (from 1980's "Permanent Waves") and the entire
Ayn Rand-inspired "2112" epic.  Lee strained to replicate his squeal in
"Temples of Syrinx"; happily, his voice has mellowed in the 20 years since it
was recorded.<p>
   They smoothly integrated classics with fresher material, moving from
"Freewill" to "Roll the Bones", from "Nobody's Hero" to "Closer to the Heart",
from an energized "Force 10" to the finale of an exuberant "Spirit of the
Radio", a cathartic "Tom Sawyer" and a powerhouse encore of "YYZ", in which Lee
crafted some especially dextrous bass lines.<p>
   If the Rush stage is a cathedral, Peart's riser -- atop which he is
encircled by a revolving cocoon of percussion that allows him to play both
acoustic and electronic kits -- is the altar.  He is the only drummer with any
business hauling out the most overused of arena rock cliches, the drum solo.
His eight-minute workout, based around the "Rhythm Method" theme he's expounded
on for years, was a taut, lyrical clinic on technical prowess and power.  Over
a rock-steady rhythm, he tapped out melodies on a cowbell and an electronic
xylophone, then switched to African-inspired beats on the toms to match his
African-inspired cap and vest.  Completing the African connection, merchandise
tables offered "The Masked Rider," Peart's travel log of his bicycling
adventures in West Africa.<p>
   Rush's two most recent albums, "Test For Echo" and "Counterparts", boast
some of the strongest, most vital music the band has made in a decade; after 22
years with the same lineup, the three still obviously enjoy their onstage
interplay, as reflected in the performances.<p>
   That, plus the visuals projected on the big-screen backdrop, the attention
to detail, the unexpected twists (like the quick breakdown following Lifeson's
solo in "Red Barchetta"), meant that this disciple, at least, left with his
faith renewed.<p>
