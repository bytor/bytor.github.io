<font size=+1>Rush thanks fans for loyalty with three-hour show</font><br>
<b>by Robert Schoenberger</b><p>

Being a Rush fan is kind of like being a 24-year-old who still wears Star Wars 
Underoos. You take a lot of abuse from non-fans, and every now and then, you 
wonder if you've outgrown them.<p>

Thursday night at the Summit, Rush paid homage to those of us who still listen
with a three-hour show full of lights, wonder and songs so long they've not
been played in concert in years.<p>

The concert to promote the band's 16th studio album <strong>Test For
Echo</strong> was part retrospective and part promotion, but it was mostly a
thank you.<p>

Nearly 20 years ago, Rush had a breakthrough with the 20-minute opus 2112.
This soaring space-opera about repression and individuality was too long for
radio and often too long for concerts, but Thursday, fans listened to find the
beauty and the anger of the piece still intact.<p>

Another highlight from the first half was drummer Neil Peart's 10-minute drum
solo in the instrumental "Limbo." Peart is arguably the most envied drummer in
rock, and his performance to a sold-out crowd showed why.<p>

Although they've been on the road for three months of nonstop shows, the
Canadian power trio seemed light-spirited. Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex
Lifeson showed off their surfing skills during an impromptu cover of
"Wipeout," and any time the two had competing solos, they actively tried to
upstage each other.<p>

Lifeson was the stage clown as always. He had the crowd in his hand, and he
knew it. During some of the tougher guitar parts, his quirky smile seemed to
ask, "You think this is hard? I've been doing this since you were in
diapers."<p>

And some in the crowd were wearing diapers. The age mix as a Rush show is a
socioeconomic abnormality that still baffles most experts. During the encore,
a mother in the third row held her baby up to see the band, while the
middle-aged man in a three-piece suit in the 10th row yelled, "Down in
front."<p>

There were '90s grunge kids and '60s flower children. Techno-lovers of the
'80s yelled out with the heavy metal fans of the '70s. The crowd wore leather,
jeans and business suits.<p>

Despite the professional polish of constant touring, the band did miss a few
notes and a few lyrics, but this was a very forgiving crowd.<p>
As one fan so eloquently said while exiting, "I would have gotten up to take a
piss at my mother's funeral, but I could not move during that show."<p>
