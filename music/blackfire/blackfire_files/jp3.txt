Andy, 
Giving your photos another look, I see 
that it does have the piezo. I made a 
few prototype preamps for John's earlier
prototypes before the module was 
completed, that were inside the control
cavity. This is obviously one of those 
Prototypes. I will get back to you when
I have some more definite information. 

I will try to find out something more 
about your particular guitar, as I'm 
now wondering if it's not the one I 
thought it was yesterday. 

Best Regards, 
Dudley

will do nicely for what I need. Thanks bunches
to both of you! Dudley: Re: the piezo. 
This guitar does indeed have a piezo bridge,
just not the piezo output control module on
the back as in the production model. I've 
attached another JPEG that shows the dual 
output jacks and piezo saddles in the bridge.
When I took the guitar to a luthier here in
Memphis that does custom work for some big
name guys (Clapton and Richards are old 
clients of his) I had a hard time getting it
back. He said it was the best acoustic 
simulation he's heard in a long while! Thanks
once again for looking into this and if any
of this piezo stuff rings any other bells 
regarding this particular unit than please 
let me know.
