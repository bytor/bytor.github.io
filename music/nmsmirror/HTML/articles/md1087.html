<em> [ Taken from Modern Drummer -- October 1987 ]</em>
<p>
    Well, I have to tell you, this has been a very interesting and
rewarding contest! 1,767 entries -- from places as far off as Zimbabwe and
Finland -- came flowing into the offices of Modern Drummer. They
represented many different styles and approaches. One of the more unusual
entries was sent in by a female drummer with a minimalist credo: The whole
tape contained just a single tom beat. Boom. She should have know I am not
one of those who believe that "less is more"!
<p>
    The first time around, each of the tapes was listened to by the
individual editors of MD. Once the entrants were narrowed down to about
150, these were listened to by a panel consisting of Ron Spagnardi, Editor/
Publisher, Rick Mattingly, Senior Editor, Rick Van Horn, Managing Editor,
and Bill Miller, Associate Editor. Together they scored each one and then
sent on the hightest-scoring 46 to me.
<p>
    Then my part of it began! I sat down with my Walkman and played each one
of the tapes, making notes as I listened. Also, I was careful not to listen
to more than 10 or 12 at a sitting, so I wouldn't get burned out or
overlook anything. I just closed my eyes and listened hard, and then I
wrote down what I liked and didn't like about the performance. When I was
particularly impressed by one, I put a big "star" beside the name.
<p>
    After I'd listened through once to each of them, I went through my
notes, choosing the "starred" ones for reevaluation, and checking to see if
any of my written comments on others seemed to merit a second listening.
After this, I was left with a lucky 13 semifinalists.
<p>
    I have to say that I was very impressed with the overall quality of
these 46 performances. In the little paragraphs that I wrote about each
tape, almost every drummer got a good review. (You won't find that out in
the real world!) All of these players had very good technique, very musical
sounding drums, and there was plenty of imagination and excitement. There
is no question in my mind that there are a lot of very good drummers out
there.
<p>
    The question might be raised: What did I judge them on? I must admit
the criteria were necessarily pretty subjective. Of course, I was aware of
technique and ability as I listened, but what moved me and the other
judges, too, I'm sure, were more subtle qualities of imagination, rhythmic
feel, and arrangement. I listened through those 13 tapes once more, this
time a little more critically, and once again made notes as I listened,
this time a little more analytically. That got me down to four finalists --
and now the judging got really tough. I listened to those last four again
and again -- but I just couldn't decide. I really liked then all, each for
different reasons. They really couldn't be qualitatively compared. Sure,
one of the things I'm happiest about is that these final four were all so
different in every way -- in musical style, indiviual style, and overall
approach. But it didn't make deciding any easier.
<p>
    For three days, I just kept coming back to those four and trying to
make up my mind -- which three, and in which order? They are all great, but
none of them is entirely the perfect choice. Who should be number one?
<p>
    Well, I decided, there really can't be a number one. What I have here
before me are four number ones. But I only have three prizes. So what else?
I'll have to get another prize!
<p>
    At this point, I decided to call my good friend Lennie DiMuzio at
Avedis Zildjian, to see if he might be willing to help me out in this. Sure
enough, Lennie came through for me, and now there is a "Fourth First Prize"
-- consisting of a set of Zildjian cymbals. My sincere thanks go out to
Lennie and the good people at Avedis Zildjian for their help in this (and
other) matters.
<p>
    In keeping with the idea of "four number ones," my ranking of these
four is somewhat arbitrary, based on the slenderest of prejudices, as is
the awarding of the prizes, so I won't degrade their efforts by that kind
of distinction here. These are some of the reasons why I like the winners.
<p>
    The entry by Jack Hess of Indianapolis is very original, in that he
spiced up his performance by triggering occasional synthesizer sounds. He
was one of a few entrants to think of this -- a very imaginative idea, but
he was the one to carry it off the best. He obviously spent a great deal of
time working on this piece, and the work pays off in the tightness and
integrity of the whole performance. The playing is first-rate, the rhythms
are very modern, and the dynamics are effectively varied both by tough and
by some tasteful rim playing. Overall, it's an excellent piece of music,
and it is very satisfying to listen to.
<p>
    I like the one by Wayne Killius, because it has such a nice approach to
a traditional, but abstract, form. His playing demonstrates a lovely touch.
It is also one of very few to use a bit of brushwork -- and is very musical
and unusual. The groove is very sophisticated, based around a funky,
walking kind of rhythm, and there are some great sections of what I call
"stiff-armed" syncopation -- a difficult style to control so smoothly. This
is a superbly restrained and deceptively simple piece of work.
<p>
    Mark Feldman of New York City sent in a nice tape also. I liked the
dark mood, the interesting construction, his smooth technique and
combinations of nice tonalities. I thought it was technically and
rhythmically quite sophisticated and very smoothly performed. Again, this
is not an easy style to pull of as well as Mark has done. The refrain of
the intro is a tasteful idea, and frames the whole piece nicely, making it,
like the others, truly a piece of music.
<p>
    The fourth one -- one I just couldn't leave out -- is by Mikel Masters
of Clearwater, Florida. I was impressed most of all because it is such an
exciting solo, but it also shows great technique, is smoothly delivered,
and is thoroughly bombastic and overplayed. I like that! The arrangement
revolves around an excellent melodic tom pattern, and I like the sound of
his drums very much, too. Part of my second set of notes reads:
"interesting, original, flashy..." and that about captures this one, a very
flamboyant and exciting performance, firmly in the Gene Krupa tradition.
