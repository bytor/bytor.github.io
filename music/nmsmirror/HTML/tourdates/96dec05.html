RUSH TO JUDGMENT</font><br>
Critical darlings?  No.  Fan favorites?  Yes.  Stubborn survivors?<br>
As all Rush Rangers know, absolutely.
<br>
<strong>By Hobart Rowland</strong><p>

     Sanctimonious intent and senseless experimentation are the
lethal ingredients in some of rock's deadliest moments, and at one
time or another, Rush has epitomized both.  Few acts have provoked
more delight and more disgust, more admiration and more irritation,
more euphoria and more nausea, than this durable Canadian power
trio.  The group has practically swaddled itself in contradictions,
weaving them into an armor seemingly designed to deter critics'
lashings and anything else that might throw the group's middlebrow
karma out of whack.<p>

     Lately, though, the data indicates that it may be safe for the
ultimate thinking headbanger's act to ditch its martyr's shroud.
Twenty-two years into its career, the band has sold more than 35
million copies of 20 releases, a dense catalog that includes 16
trips to the studio, three live CDs and one best-of collection.  It
continues to fill stadiums worldwide, proving that Rush is one of
the moist endurable live acts around.  The group found its first
fans on the road, and the stage still provides the most effective
make-or-break introduction to its music.  Make it through three
hours of Rush's union of art-rock pretention, busy guitar work and
abrupt time changes played dutifully, loudly and precisely, and you
should know full well where you stand on your way out.<p>

     At a time when the group may be past its creative prime, new
Rush releases consistently inch up the rock charts, often with
little help from radio.  Young, adventurous bands such as Primus
and Soundgarden proudly sing Rush's praises.  Even critics once
appalled by the band's music, and even more appalled by its
success, have started to find the occasional good thing to say
about Rush.<p>

     What gives?  Could it be that the rest of the world is finally
figuring out what millions of Rush fans have known all along?
Anything's possible, but more than likely what we're witnessing
involves a phenomenon significantly less dramatic:  patience.<p>

     "We had to wait [this] long for [a] generation to come around
and understand us," says Rush drummer Neil Peart.  "Because
certainly the [music] writers in the '70s didn't understand what
we were trying to do."<p>

     It's easy to come away from a conversation with Peart thinking
that he, guitarist Alex Lifeson and bassist Geddy Lee actually get
off on the critical abude they've suffered -- that it has only
heightened their resolve and bound them more tightly together.
After all, if Rush's existence hinged on the approval of anyone but
itself and its fans, it might not have made it past 1976's sci-fi
rock opera 2112, a release that resisted harsh -- and justifiable --
pummeling by rock's arbiters of taste (though it has since gone
platinum, proving once again that critics mainly influence other
critics).  Rather than buckle under to the name-calling, Rush moved
forward, negotiating its way through the late '70s with another
pair of numbing doodle-metal epics whose fairyland titles, A
Farewell to Kings and Hemispheres, pretty much say it all.<p>

     "We are experimental, so there have been tangents," says
Peart.  "I can look at an older song and say, 'That was an
interesting tangent that was like a dead-end canyon.'  But I don't
regret any of our excesses."<p>

     Rush's most refined tangent -- its stint as a synth-inclined,
radio-friendly pop band -- began with 1980's Permanent Waves, home to
the AOR staple "The Spirit of Radio," and culminated with 1985's
Power Windows, arguably the band's most consistent and least windy
work.  But again, if Rush had listened to writers such as myself
and ended on a high note in 1986, it wouldn't be on the road right
now supporting its 20th release, Test for Echo, an impeccably
produced, guitar-heavy affair good for at least four or five
decent moments.<p>

     "We're not trying to write for an imaginary audience or some
lowest common denominator," says Peart.  "We write for people like
us.  And there are a lot of them out there."<p>
<center>============================
</center><p>

     Even with the current moratorium on Rush bashing, one can
assume that most journalists inclined to devote more than a few
sentences to the band are A) serious fans or B) had once been
serious fans.  I admit to a mix of A and B;  I've been a Rush
Ranger for 16 years now, though of late my enthusiasm for the band
has fluctuated from release to release.  I inform Peart that I've
been questioning my faith, and he lets go the sigh of a person
who's heard it all before.<p>

     "Fandom is a very fickle enterprise," he explains.  "We have
to win [our fans] every time.  We never take for granted that we're
going to put out a record and people are going to buy it;  we never
take for granted that we're going to go on tour and people are
going to come.  It makes us insecure, but that's okay, we shouldn't
be secure.  If we fuck up, people won't love us."<p>

     My love affair with Rush began -- and to an extent ended -- with
Neil Peart.  His dizzying drum aerobics on early '80s releases such
as Moving Pictures and Signals blew my impressionable young
mind -- as they had many a teenage timekeeper since.  At the time, a
prized sketch of Peart girdled by his drums hung in my bedroom as
inspiration, though it didn't much help my technique.  Try as I
might, I couldn't survive the exhausting workout that is "Spirit of
Radio" without a break.  Keeping pace with my prog-rock inspiration
was a humbling experience, so I gave up trying and focused my
playing on more reasonable goals -- like, say, "Brown Sugar."<p>

     As I got older, my enthusiasm for Rush waned in proportion to
my decreasing respect for Peart's drumming, which, to my mind, was
becoming less interesting.  I'd discovered the Clash, the
Pretenders, Elvis Costello and Squeeze, and was getting into
drummers with whom I could actually play along without cramping up.
They were human;  Peart was superhuman, and therefore no longer
worthy of my attention.  But Peart makes no apologies to anyone for
his abstrusities.<p>

     "It's very facile to say that less is more," he says.  "I
don't believe that in drumming, and I don't believe that in words
either.  If you are going to use something simple it has to be
excellently chosen.  I would never be happy playing mindless rock
beats.  But I'll always find ways to imply that if it's what is
needed."<p>

     After a short defection, I was lured back to Rush for a time
during college.  The mother ship has a way of keeping a leash on
Rangers who stray.  It does so by sabotaging their pleasure centers
with a remarkable chord progression, a monster chorus or a wordy
lyric that's, nevertheless, hard to shake, thus, finessing
them -- okay, us -- back into the fold.<p>

     "People have grown up with us as we've grown up.  People have
dropped in and out along the way, but some stay with us," Peart
says.  "It's all been earned."<p>
<center>============================
</center><p>

     Aside from his duties as drummer, Peart writes Rush's lyrics.
He has since 1974, when he was hired to replace the group's first
drummer, John Rutsey, whose "mindless rock beats" couldn't be
molded to accommodate the band's increasingly intricate ideas.
Peart became the band's lyricist by default, after the rest of the
band expressed their distaste for the job.<p>

     "I'm only a lyricist for maybe a month every three years," he
says.  "But still, it becomes another profession of collecting the
stuff, refining the craft and keeping lists of phrases, bits of
conversation and possible song titles."<p>

     Peart's fussed-over prose has been a primary rallying point
for Rush haters over the years -- second only, perhaps, to Geddy
Lee's Pavarotti-chipmunk wail, which, in its highest late '79s
register, was pegged quite accurately as a cross between Robert
Plant and Donald Duck (he's since toned down the histrionics).  In
Peart's world, Tom Sawyer walks the 20th-century landscape as a
tough-as-nails warrior, Egypt enjoys half a CD's stay in outer
space and a forest is up in limbs when the maple trees pit
themselves against oaks in a battle over sunshine rights -- all of
which would seem pretty silly if Peart's tone wasn't so stone-faced
sincere most of the time.  Rush has a healthy sense of humor, often
opening its shows with clips from classic cartoons and Three
Stooges episodes, but you'd be hard-pressed to find much of it in
Peart's lyrics.<p>

     For the group's latest CD, Test for Echo, Peart sequestered
himself in room at Chalet Studio, a country retreat outside of
Toronto, for days, churning out lyrics to such dandies as "Driven"
("Driven to the margin of error / Driven to the edge of control /
Driven to the margin of terror / Driven to the edge of a deep, dark
hole") and "Virtuality" ("I'm a castaway, stranded in a desolate
land / I can see the footprints in the virtual sand").<p>

     "I think I've gotten better at [writing] over the years,"
Peart says.  "There is still plenty of metaphysics woven in there
and lots of abstract metaphors.  All of that stuff is there, but
I've learned better to write on multiple levels, where it can be
perceived as a simple statement if you want to take it that way."<p>

     Peart put away his notes during Rush's year-and-a-half hiatus
after the 1994 tour for Test for Echo's predecessor, Counterparts.
During that period, while Lifeson recorded a solo release (Victor)
and Lee spent time with his baby girl, Peart produced a tribute to
big band legend Buddy Rich (Burning for Buddy) and retooled his
technique behind the drum set.<p>

     "I completely restructured my whole approach to the
instrument, really ... holding the sticks differently, hitting
differently and sitting differently," says Peart.  "I even
postponed the recording of this album so that I'd have a full year
to let these things come to maturity."<p>

     Longtime Peart enthusiasts, however, needn't concern
themselves with any adverse side effects.  "It's very subtle;  the
listener probably won't notice it," he says.  "Even our co-producer
at the time commented that it still sounds like me."<p>

     Peart was forced to waste part of his break from Rush on a
less constructive project -- trying to quell gossip that he was
terminally ill.  "I almost hate to dignify rumors by addressing
them," he says, "but it was just a whole bunch of bullshit people
dreamed up.  People were phoning my parents and asking, 'Is it true
he's dying of cancer?'  What if it were true?  It gets so
uncivilized when you think about the realities of it.  People
always forget that there are real people involved."<p>

     Guess it comes with the territory.  When a band is moving
along as smoothly as Rush has for the last two decades without the
help of hype, it seems there's always someone around to toss a
little friction into the equation.  Still, there's no denying
Rush's increased hip quotient.  Whether the newfound
tolerance -- and, in some cases, respect -- has come as a result of the
group simply hanging in there long enough to earn it, whether the
band's music has actually improved with age or whether its
detractors have simply run out of nasty, one-off dismissals that
look good in print is grounds for the sort of debate that Peart
could not care less about.  Besides, he says, Rush still has a way
to go with some rock institutions.<p>

     "Geddy told me an interesting thing the other day -- that when
he was doing a small Q&A session for Rolling Stone, the writer let
slip that we are their readers' number one most requested group for
them to do a full story on," Peart says.  "But they won't because
of who they are and who we are.  That's a trip, if you ask me."<p>

     "We're just not cool enough for them.  But that's okay,
because they're not cool enough for us."<p>

Rush thanks fans for loyalty with three-hour show</font><br>
<strong>by Robert Schoenberger</strong>, Managing Editor<p>

Being a Rush fan is kind of like being a 24-year-old who still wears Star Wars 
Underoos. You take a lot of abuse from non-fans, and every now and then, you 
wonder if you've outgrown them.<p>

Thursday night at the Summit, Rush paid homage to those of us who still listen
with a three-hour show full of lights, wonder and songs so long they've not
been played in concert in years.<p>

The concert to promote the band's 16th studio album <strong>Test For
Echo</strong> was part retrospective and part promotion, but it was mostly a
thank you.<p>

Nearly 20 years ago, Rush had a breakthrough with the 20-minute opus 2112.
This soaring space-opera about repression and individuality was too long for
radio and often too long for concerts, but Thursday, fans listened to find the
beauty and the anger of the piece still intact.<p>

Another highlight from the first half was drummer Neil Peart's 10-minute drum
solo in the instrumental "Limbo." Peart is arguably the most envied drummer in
rock, and his performance to a sold-out crowd showed why.<p>

Although they've been on the road for three months of nonstop shows, the
Canadian power trio seemed light-spirited. Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex
Lifeson showed off their surfing skills during an impromptu cover of
"Wipeout," and any time the two had competing solos, they actively tried to
upstage each other.<p>

Lifeson was the stage clown as always. He had the crowd in his hand, and he
knew it. During some of the tougher guitar parts, his quirky smile seemed to
ask, "You think this is hard? I've been doing this since you were in
diapers."<p>

And some in the crowd were wearing diapers. The age mix as a Rush show is a
socioeconomic abnormality that still baffles most experts. During the encore,
a mother in the third row held her baby up to see the band, while the
middle-aged man in a three-piece suit in the 10th row yelled, "Down in
front."<p>

There were '90s grunge kids and '60s flower children. Techno-lovers of the
'80s yelled out with the heavy metal fans of the '70s. The crowd wore leather,
jeans and business suits.<p>

Despite the professional polish of constant touring, the band did miss a few
notes and a few lyrics, but this was a very forgiving crowd.<p>
As one fan so eloquently said while exiting, "I would have gotten up to take a
piss at my mother's funeral, but I could not move during that show."<p>
