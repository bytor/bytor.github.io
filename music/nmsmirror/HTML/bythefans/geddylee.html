<em>October 9, 1993</em>
<p>

At home<br>
drawing circles<br>
and pentagrams<br>
with him inside<br>
out there on his lawn<br>
Fender poised to play<br>
as his fans lay in pools of sprinkler flow<p>

Alex didn't like religion<br>
Ohh, and his hexes are makin' Neil lose his hair<br>
King Geddy Lee the wiccan<br>
Tool of the Underworld<p>

Geddy Lee worships As-mo-day<br>
Geddy Lee wore his toque today<p>

barely, I was a member<br>
a wiccan little boy<br>
seemed a harmless little cult<br>
but we unleashed a demon<br>
gnashed its teeth and bit ole' Geddy on the nose<p>

How could I not laugh?<br>
and he nailed me with an evil curse<br>
its effect uncertain<br>
Ohh, I'm still hopin'<br>
that what he said<br>
what he said, he erred<p>

Alex never had affection<br>
for those robes that even Neil wouldn't wear<br>
King Geddy Lee and witches<br>
rule our world<p>

Geddy Lee sent me VIBES today<br>
Geddy Lee lives in a new world way<br>
Geddy Lee lost his glasses today<p>

try to ignore this<br>
try to erase this<br>
from your hard drive<p>

Geddy is a priest of syrinx today<br>
Geddy was a Nazi in a play<p>

Geddy Lee asks that<br>
          asks that<br>
Geddy Lee asks that<br>
          asks that<br>
Geddy Lee asks that you be nice to people today.<p>
