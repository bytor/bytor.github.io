by Tom Beaudoin<br>
<em>April 4, 1995</em>
<p>

A knight alone<br>
Where is that throne?<br>
Thank heavens I'm old enough to use the toilet alone!<br>
I feel the knots<br>
In my stomach spots<br>
I'm into vertigo!<p>

Sometimes after this eating<br>
Like a lamb my tummy's bleating<br>
My medieval roommate<br>
Thought that it would be great<br>
To make me find some Solo Seating!<p>

[music intro to chorus]<p>

It's insane!  I took my chances<br>
On apple pie<br>
Tricked by Sir Comestancis<br>
In the woods<br>
I shouldn't trust him<br>
The more I was fed, I should have used my head<p>

[music link to verse]<p>

Now I've found the prime location<br>
To toss that rotten pastry<br>
About to heave, the apples want to leave<br>
Gee, they sure weren't very tasty<br>

In my dyspeptic confusion<br>
I want to give that guy a contusion...<p>

[music intro to chorus]<p>

It's not the same<br>
When it comes back out<br>
My mouth and my snout!<br>
Apple pie recycled!<br>
Makes me gag<br>
And so I vow revenge<br>
The more he will laugh,<br>
I'll jab him with my staff.<p>

It's insane! I took my chances<br>
On apple pie<br>
Tricked by Sir Comestancis<br>
In the woods<br>
I'll never trust him<br>
The next time we meet<br>
I'll vomit right at his feet.<p>
