"INTO AFRICA:  Two weeks on the road through sun-parched savanna 
and medieval villages"

        The sun dropped behind a broken finger of stone, and we
pedalled on.  I crouched over the handlebars and peered into the 
dark, trying to avoid the patches of loose gravel, sandy ruts and 
large stones.  My five companions were strung along the road ahead 
like wraiths, sensed only by moonglow on white helmets, tires 
crunching, and the occasional grunt or muttered curse.  We had not 
planned on this -- the Bicycle Africa itinerary didn't mention 
anything about pedalling through the dark savanna -- but Africa 
laughs at plans.<p>
     
David Mozer, our guide, had tried to consider everything in 
planning our two-week tour of Mali, from the timing of each 
village's market day, the most colorful time to visit, to the 
schedule of the riverboat that had carried us and our bicycles 
down the Niger.  But the riverboat had been a half-day late to 
the dusty river town of Mopti.  We could stay overnight, but 
that would put us another whole day behind, and after two 
broiling days on the riverboat we were eager to get out in the 
open country and do some cycling.  So we headed for Songo -- 60 km 
away, with only an hour of daylight remaining.  David thought 
the full moon would be bright enough to ride by, and if the way 
proved too perilous we could simply camp beside the road.  But 
once the harsh beauty of the savanna had shaded from twilight 
blue to silver and black, sleeping rough seemed less 
attractive -- nothing lights the imagination like the dark.  We 
kept riding.<p>
     
        Bicycle Africa has offered tours since 1983, exploring cultures
and landscapes in many countries, from Tunisia to Zimbabwe, and 
from Kenya to Senegal.  My first trip had been a month-long 
odyssey through Cameroon, which now stands as one of my richest 
experiences.  At the time, though, it felt more like a gruelling 
ordeal, capped by a harrowing escape through war-torn Chad.  I 
swore I'd never do anything like that again.  But, as many 
travellers have discovered, Africa has a way of calling you back.<p>
     
        The following year, I cycled through Togo and Ghana with David,
and now I was back a third time, beginning a two-week tour in 
Mali.  Landlocked in the remote heart of West Africa, more than 
half the country is buried under the ever-encroaching Sahara. 
The rest is mainly Sahel, "the boarder," a belt of parched 
savanna fringing the desert.  Mali is a thirsty land, and 
sometimes hungry when the rains fail.  But the upper reaches of 
the Niger, the "strong brown god," loop through the southern 
part of the country, where farmers work their fields and 
fishermen ply the river with nets and poles.  One gets the 
feeling that life goes on with difficulty, but generally without 
despair.<p>
     
        This trip had begun in Bamako, the capital, where the six of
us -- apart from David and myself, there was a California 
firefighter, a psychiatrist from northern Italy and two sisters, 
from Seattle and San Francisco -- boarded the riverboat for the 
two-day journey downriver.  It was a perfect introduction to the 
pageant of West African life:  angular canoes called pirogues 
worked along the shores, men poling at each end or stooping to 
gather in their nets.  Some carried produce or firewood; others 
ferried people between the sand-castle villages -- adobe cubes and 
rectangles surrounding the rounded mud turret of a mosque.  Some 
villages were more temporary:  beehive-shaped houses of woven 
straw belong to the "river people," the Bozo.<p>
     
        We made several stops, the big boat churning into the muddy
bottom and simple dropping its gangplank over the water.  People 
scrambled off and on, shouting and laughing, singing and hawking 
their wares.  One pirogue came alongside, heavy with bundles, 
boxes, women and babies, and suddenly flipped over -- a chorus of 
shrieks as everyone went into the river.  But in the African way 
of helping the larger family, people on our boat reached down to 
rescue the bundles, boxes, women and babies, and life went on.<p>
     
        In the larger town of Segou, we leaned on the rail as hundreds
of people crowded along the shore, some wrestling on or off the 
boat along a narrow plank, some just watching, others selling 
fruit, vegetables and everything from cheap watches to baby 
clothes.  A few of the Tuareg people stood out in their costume 
of head-to-toe indigo -- dressed for the desert, but with no 
caravans to lead.  They have begun to drift into the towns, 
trying to survive by selling their only lasting heritage:  the 
art of elegantly crafted jewelry, filigreed scimitars and 
tooled-leather boxes.  For centuries, the Tuareg had driven 
their camel trains across the Sahara, but trucks were taking 
over, and these proud nomads are becoming, like the Masai in 
East Africa, a colorful anachronism.  Progress takes prisoners.<p>
     
        Two nights later, on the dark road to Songo, fatigue was
setting in -- not to mention hunger.  After three hours of 
treacherous, anxious cycling, the moon finally illuminated a 
small sign at the roadside:  "Campement de Songo 4 km," pointing 
down a faint track in the bush.  With mingled hope and 
trepidation we pedalled into the shadows, snagged by thorns, 
jolted by rocks and skidding in the sand.  The campement was a 
thatched shelter on the edge of the lightless village, where we 
leaned our bikes with sighs of deep relief.  David performed the 
inevitable African ritual of bargaining for our food and 
lodging, and villagers materialized with shy smiles and big 
basins of rice and sauce, a West African specialty.  Two shotgun 
blasts echoed around us -- to celebrate a local wedding, we were 
told -- as we set up our mosquito tents under the stars.<p>
     
        Songo was our introduction to Dogon country.  Like the Tuareg,
the Dogon are a colorful anachronism; isolation and the strength 
of their culture have allowed them to endure for centuries 
without much change.  But the Dogon are settled and 
concentrated, their villages and farms spread along the 
Bandiagara Escarpment -- some built right into the cliffs, like 
the Anaszi cliff-dwelings of the American Southwest.  Dogon 
carving is celebrated in the West as among the finest in Africa:
 like the art of our Renaissance, each detail of a granary door,
a mask or post in the men's meeting house reflects layers of 
allegory and a complex set rituals and symbols.  It was easy to 
see why the French anthropologist Marcel Griaule spent 35 years 
studying the Dogon before publishing his definitive 
Conversations with Ogotemmeli.  As we pedalled away, our only 
regret was that we couldn't hope to comprehend it all, and we 
agreed that the only solution would be another visit -- Africa 
always calls you back.<p>
     
        But it calls collect and makes you pay.  Our next two days
offered long hours of bad riding through sand, rocks, thorns and 
heat, and life seemed reduced to a struggle to turn the pedals 
and find water.  But in the way Africa has of rewarding your 
sufferings, we finally arrived at a medieval city sculpted of 
mud.<p>
     
        Djenne rose to prominence in the 13th century when the Empire
of Mali brought wealth and refinement to the southern Sahara, 
and has been little altered since.  Riding beneath a huge 
archway of adobe, we wound through the mud-walled streets to the 
Grande Mosquee, a massive structure of timber-reinforced mud 
built in 1905, replacing a similar mosque that had stood for 
nine centuries until it was leveled in a religious war.  The 
minarets were capped with ostrich eggs, the exposed beams used 
as scaffolding to resurface the mud -- each year, after the rains.<p>
     
        Sore from cycling, we hired a pirogue to carry us to the next
town upriver.  (David would want the record to show that the 
rest of us talked him into this.)  "Environ six heures" -- about 
six hours -- we were assured, without mentioning that if, say, the 
motor died in our leaky old canoe, we would be stranded 
overnight on a desolate stretch of river with nothing to eat but 
rice gruel made from river water.  These things weren't planned, 
but of course they happened.  You never saw six people so happy, 
23 hours later, to climb on their bicycles and ride.<p>
     
        Mali has no beach resorts or famous game parks, and so attracts
few tourists.  This is partly why visitors can travel back in 
time to medieval towns more true-to-life than anything in the 
"olde Worlde," and to pueblo villages more vibrant than any in 
the American Southwest -- because people still live in them, much 
as they always have.  Isolated, they are free to not change.<p>
     
        Traditional African life is a cycle endlessly repeated, wheels
within wheels.  Dry seasons and rains are the larger rhythms in 
the closed circle of family, tradition, music, labor and 
laughter.  In contrast to our Western compulsion to "change the 
changes" -- sometimes for improvement, sometimes merely for 
novelty -- in traditional Africa what was once truth and beauty is 
always truth and beauty.  Homes, clothing, art, proverbs, 
dances, religion -- even hairstyles; always there is style, a 
sense of esthetics and protocol in every aspect of life, but 
there are no "fashions."  In the cultural upheaval taking place 
in African cities, this has begun to shift -- the young seem to 
like our revelations-per-minute approach to life -- but in the 
villages of Mali, the old ways remain surprisingly constant.<p>
     
        In a Dogon village of stone, mud and thatch, just at sunset, I
stood looking over the houses from an adobe rooftop, where I was 
setting up my mosquito tent.  The only sound I could hear was 
conversation -- no radio, no TV, no traffic, just the murmur of 
people talking, from that house there, that one over there, 
another behind.  As darkness fell, broken only by stars, a few 
kerosene lanterns and the rising moon, I climbed down to the 
courtyard and joined the rest of our group, sitting and talking 
with some of the villagers.  These are the times that call you 
back to Africa.<p>
