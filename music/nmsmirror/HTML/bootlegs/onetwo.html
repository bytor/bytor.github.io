This is the only Rush double cd bootleg I know of that comes in two 
separate cases. If you're looking to get it (although I'm not quite sure if
you should), make SURE you get both parts! This is a show from Roll the Bones,
but it is not the complete concert. It cuts out just after "Roll The Bones"
and comes back in in the middle of "The Pass". The songs that are missing 
(if you care to know) are "Show Don't Tell" and "The Big Money".<p>

The sound has its moments (and this boot definitely sounds better than
most of the Counterparts boots), but the recording level keeps
jumping around; sometimes it's too low and muffled, sometimes way too high.
And there are several people talking/yelling during some of the songs.
Surprisingly though, when the recording is good -- which is most of the time
-- you can hear all the instruments, although Geddy's bass tends towards 
the low side when Alex is wailing away.<p>

The packaging is bad, especially considering that this show comes in two
separate cases. There are no pictures of the band except the two on the front,
and a black & white picture of Neil on the back (obviously from an earlier
tour). Each part of the encore is indexed separately, and "Xanadu" is
mislabelled as "Kanadu". The place is also mislabelled as Rosemont Illinois.<p>

Overall, not a half-bad bootleg, worth a second listen if you have the time
and money. However, keep in mind that this is not the complete show, and there
are better sounding full show boots out there. <p>
