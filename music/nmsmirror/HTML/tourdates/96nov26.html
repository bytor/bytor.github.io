Fans Get a Power Rush 
</font><p>
<strong>By NATALIE NICHOLS</strong><P>

Rush's energetic, three-hour concert Tuesday night at the Forum was an
old-fashioned rock show, strictly for adoring fans. There was no stage-diving,
no crowd-surfing -- just an elated, near-capacity crowd flicking its Bics and
cheering on its heroes. <p>

The veteran Canadian power trio, in turn, provided everything a Rush
aficionado could want: hits, favorites and songs from the new album, "Test for
Echo," plus loads of instrumental noodling and plenty of lasers, strobes, video
and live camera shots of the band members on a huge split screen behind them.
(The only things missing were explosions and smoke.) <p>

The arena-rock trappings, including drummer Neil Peart's rotating riser,
belied the group's low-key presence, but complemented its brand of musicianly,
yet populist, prog-rock. The sound has remained remarkably consistent for 22
years: Stripping the blues from such influences as Cream and Led Zeppelin,
Rush produces rock flourishes galore but little groove. The tricky time
signatures and instrumental virtuosity offer some drama and Peart's
high-concept lyrical metaphors occasionally strike anthem-like notes. But the
repertoire is alarmingly one-note -- and either you dig it or you don't. <p>

Accordingly, the Forum audience was ecstatic as guitarist Alex Lifeson
and bassist-keyboardist Geddy Lee unleashed barrages of expert riffs (never
mind that Lee's grainy falsetto occasionally couldn't quite reach those high
notes). While his drumming was comparatively streamlined, Peart still managed
a lot of notes, including an epic, nearly 10-minute solo. <p>

In spite of all the jamming, however, the show was surprisingly devoid
of spontaneity. Parts of Peart's solo were played in sync with visuals, 
making it feel overly rehearsed. Not that the fans cared: When the lights 
finally came up, they screamed for more.

Rush at the Great Western Forum, November 26
</font><P>
<strong>by Skylaire Alfvegren</strong><p>

Whatever one's opinion of Rush's importance in the great pop scheme of
things, one must admire their paranormal musical abilities and unfaltering
dedication to their craft.  Few bands can boast packed arenas 22 years into
their careers without some reunion gimmick attached.  With the band
ostensibly on the road in support of their new Atlantic disk, Test for Echo,
this tour ( with two nights in L.A.) was the first to forsake an opening act
and offer three hours of unadulterated Rush!<p>

Rush attracts geeks of every persuasion and musical preference.  At the
Forum, tattered tour shirts abounded, from Sepultura to Miles Davis, Yes to
Rage Against the Machine.  The bank opened the first set with "Dreamline" on
a stage littered with various kitchen appliances, miniature electrical towers
and a Three Stooges cardboard cutout.  A few Test for Echo tunes and an
abbreviated run-through of their epic 2112 were enhanced by a cascade of neon
pink, purple and green lights that issued from prop satellite dishes.
Cheeseball biker-movie trailers ran during intermission instead of the
bygone arty shots dramatizing Ayn Rand's writings, or lush videos that
accompanied the music.  The second set commenced with the title track form
the new album and a plum-colored view of drummer/lyricist Neil Peart in
silhouette.  Like the Planet of the Apes movies, Peart's lyrics invite
interesting interpretations; during the evening, the many phases of Rush's
career were represented: sci-fi prog (2112), abstractions of man's struggle
("Tom Sawyer," "Subdivisions," "Free Will"), existentialist noodle-poodle
("Dreamline," "The Trees") and anthemic favorites ("Spirit of Radio," "Closer
to the Heart").<p>

As the lights dimmed in anticipation of Peart's percussive dementia, Kiss'
recent Forum show came to mind.  Rush didn't need exploding guitars or blood
capsules to dazzle their audience.  The juxtaposition of Peter Criss’
putt-putt "solo" with the extreme congestion of snares, toms, bells and
exotic gewgaws in Peart's bunkerlike drum kit was good for a chuckle.  The
crowd was a blanket of air-drums during his quarter-hour-long solo, the same
on he's been embellishing since the '70s, which features more rhythms that
stoned fans in the crowd.  Midway through, Peart stood up while the drum
riser turned 180 degrees to reposition a more world-beat-friendly kit within
smashing range.<p>

Some complain about Rush's lack of spontaneity.  But the straightforward
assault is necessary - no masturbatory jamming means more hits.  Guitarist
Alex Lifeson trilled with expert abandon, while mosquito-voiced Geddy Lee,
the Zeus of the bass-god pantheon, shrieked and thundered and tinkled.  As
always, they put on a excellent show.  Never mind their detractors; 30,000
L.A. Rush fans can't be wrong.<p>
