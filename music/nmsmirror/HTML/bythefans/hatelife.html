by Ken Maupin<br>
<em>September 18, 1991</em>
<p>

HUSBAND'S VERSE:<br>
Just another in-law, long outlasting their stay<br>
Just another Bon bill she expects me to pay<br>
Just another dinner means more heartburn and pain<br>
Just another day -- at the end of her ball and chain<p>

HUSBAND'S CHORUS:<br>
THE BROAD AIN'T LEAVIN' -- She always complains<br>
THE BROAD AIN'T LEAVIN' -- She drives me insane<br>
I HATE MY LIFE<p>

WIFE'S VERSE:<br>
Just another whiner, pours his beer down his throat<br>
Just another fat ass in a fishing boat<br>
Just another boozer, always jobless and broke<br>
Just another day -- in a castle with a Coor's Light moat<p>

WIFE'S CHORUS:<br>
THE CLOD'S A HEATHEN -- Just look at this stain<br>
THE CLOD'S A HEATHEN -- All men are the same<br>
I HATE MY LIFE<p>

HUSBAND'S SPOKEN VERSE:<br>
greedy jealous money-hungry shopping mall tourist<br>
talk show and soap opera watching self-taught psychotherapist<br>
irrational demanding whining freedom-choking feminist<br>
wrinkled grey-haired sagging vericosed arthritic gruesomeness<p>

WIFE'S SPOKEN VERSE:<br>
armchair natural gas-producing jaundiced beer-evangelist<br>
chauvinistic smelly hairy foul-mouthed macho egotist<br>
impotent pot-bellied balding middle-aged misogynist<br>
in-debt-up-to-his-eyeballs undereducated credit-risk<p>

FAMILY VERSE:<br>
Just another family, the Cleavers they aren't<br>
Just another household completely lacking heart<br>
Just another marriage on the rocks from the start<br>
Just another couple -- wed until "death do us part"<p>

FAMILY CHORUS:<br>
ONLY GOD KNOWS THE REASON -- The story's the same<br>
ONLY GOD KNOWS THE REASON -- Why love is so lame<br>
I HATE MY LIFE<p>
