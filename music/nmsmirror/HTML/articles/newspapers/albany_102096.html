<font size=+1>Rush is greeted with open arms</font><br>
<b>by Greg Haymes</b><p>

Albany -- Canadian rock trio Rush sent out their signals in support of their
new album, "Test for Echo," from the Knickerbocker Arena on Saturday night,
and the response came back loud and clear.<p>

Rush has always had a strong fan base in the Capital Region -- heck,
in their earlier days, they managed to sell out two shows in the Palace
Theatre only a week apart -- but this is the alterna-rock 90's, where bands
often achieve superstar status and then disappear in the span between their
first and second albums.<p>

Having released their debut album some 22 years ago, Rush is a
veteran band with a lot of history hanging around their necks.  But they've
been off of the scene for three years, which is nearly an eternity in the
rock world.<p>

In fact, "Test for Echo" has already dropped out of the Top 40 on
the Billboard album charts.<p>

So bassist-vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer
Neil Peart took their show to the people -- rehearsing in town last week and
launching their world-wide tour at the Knick on Saturday.<p>

It wasn't quite a sell-out, but it was pretty close, and the fans'
enthusiastic response welcomed back Rush with open arms.<p>

"We're only immortal for a limited time," Lee sang during the show
opener, but judging by the rabid response from the fans, Rush's time isn't
up quite yet.<p>

After all these years, Rush has finally managed to click with their
own unique brand of progressive rock rooted in the power-trio tradition of
bands like Cream, Hendrix, and Mountain.  And to top it all off, they've
thrust the whole hyper-hybrid smack into the cyber-happy 90's.<p>

Just a few years ago, Rush's music took second billing to
over-powering arena theatrics.  In concert these days, the band has still
got the stuff to dazzle an audience -- their bedazzling light show is still
second to none -- but this time around, they toned down the gimmicky end of
the show in favor of the music.<p>

The stage set was minimal, dressed only in a sort of kitchen-kitsch
motive complete with white refrigerator plunked down next to Peart's drum
riser and a shelf full of blenders, mixers, and other small appliances
sitting next to Lee's amps.  And of course, there were the requisite batch
of film and video footage on the big screens behind the band.<p>

But it was the music that was front and center, mixing old
repertoire with "Test for Echo" selections.  Whether it was the whip-snap
instrumental of "Limbo," the Bic-flickin' crowd fave "Closer to the Heart"
or the heavy metal leanings of "Time and Motion," Rush was up to the
required tasks.<p>

Touring for the first time ever without an opening act, Rush took
full advantage of the extra time onstage.  Their first set ran a full hour
and a half.<p>

"We're gonna take some Geritol and be back in 20 minutes," Lee
joked, but sure enough, they came charging back from intermission after
just 19 minutes with the title track of the new album.  And they kept
cranking it out for another 75 minutes.<p>

Rush was coming back from a three-year break (their longest ever),
and the time off clearly did them good.  They were considerably more
animated and looser onstage than they've been in the past, yet they've
sacrificed none of their precision.<p>

On the downside, Peart's lyrics -- inspired by writer like Ayn Rand,
John Dos Passos and science fiction in general -- frequently weigh like an
anchor on the music.<p>

Let's face it, lyrics like, "Why are we here?  Because we're here,"
aren't exactly the deep philosophical ponderings they aspire to.<p>

On the other hand, it's only rock 'n' roll.  The churning "Half the
World" attempted some kind of zen-like yin-yang balance, but in truth it
was a pretty good groove.  And there simply aren't very many bands who can
squeeze such an onslaught of poly-syllabic words into their lyrics and
still rock like Rush does.<p>
