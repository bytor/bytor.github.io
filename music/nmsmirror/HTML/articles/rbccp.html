     Hi Folks --<p>

   Here we are again -- a new album, <strong>Counterparts</strong>, is out 
and I hope
you're all enjoying it. As usual, I have written a little "bio-thing"
to accompany it, telling the story behind the making of the record,
and thoughts on some of the songs. This will probably be sent out to
educate the members of the press, and will also appear in the tour
book (and possibly here in the newsletter -- if they've got *room*, by
the time I'm finished answering all these questions), so I won't
recount the same stories.<p>
   Instead, I'll get straight to what's <strong>special</strong> about this forum:
answering the questions <strong>you</strong> people send in...<p>

<strong>
Q.1  What inspired the "Fear" trilogy, as heard in reverse order on the
     albums <em>Moving Pictures</em>, <em>Signals</em>, and <em>Grace 
Under Pressure</em>?
     Why were they recorded in reverse order?<br>
Q.2  What is the significance of the phrase "Now it's dark" at the end
     of the liner notes for <em>Roll The Bones?</em>

1/     I started with these two questions because many others have
     asked them too. The idea for the trilogy was suggested by an
     older man telling that he didn't think life was ruled by love, or
     reason, or money, or the pursuit of happiness -- but by <strong>fear</strong>.
     This smart-but cynical guy's position was that most people's
     actions are motivated by fear of being hungry, fear of being
     hurt, fear of being alone, fear of being robbed, etc,. and that
     people don't make choices based on hope that something <strong>good</strong>
     will happen, but in fear that something <strong>bad</strong> will happen.<p>
       I reacted to this the way all of us tend to react to
    generalities: "Well, <strong>I'm</strong> not like that!" But then I started
    thinking about it more, watching the way people around me behaved,
    and I soon realised that there <strong>was</strong> something to this viewpoint,
    So I sketched out the three "theaters of fear," as I saw them: how
    fear works inside us ("The Enemy Within"), how fear is used
    against us ("The Weapon"), and how fear feeds the mob mentality
    ("Witch Hunt").<p>
      As it happened, the last theme was easiest to deal with, so it
   was written first, and consequently appeared first on record, and
   the other two followed in reverse order for the same reason.<p>

2/    The phrase occurs in David Lynch's comedy classic <strong>Blue Velvet</strong>.

Q. Any plans to celebrate your 20th anniversary with a tour, records,
   videos?

   Yes indeed, we are giving that some serious thought. We can't think
of another group which has survived for so long with the same
individuals, and since those individuals are <strong>us</strong>, we think the
occasion deserves some tribute. We haven't decided exactly <strong>what</strong>
tribute yet, but we are thinking about the possibility of
retrospective shows, live recordings, and videos. Later in the year we
will have a clearer idea of what, exactly, we're going to do. But
we're going to do <strong>something</strong> -- <strong>at</strong> least have cake!

<strong>
Q.1  Any reason why you used a single bass drum for the <em>Roll The
     Bones</em> tour?<br>
Q.2  Are the references in <em>Middletown Dreams</em> to specific people, or
     are they allegorical?
</strong><br>

1/   Just before recording <strong>Roll The Bones</strong>, I started changing my
     drum kit around a bit, to keep myself out of "familiar patterns."
     I had always wanted to try one of those "double pedals", a
     mechanical linkage which allows you to play with two seperate
     pedals connected to the same <strong>drum</strong>, and I found I liked it a
     lot -- the notes were cleaner and more even, and I could get rid of
     that big empty resonating chamber: the other bass drum. So I did.<p>

2/  A bit of both actually. I was thinking of Sherwood Anderson and
    Paul Gaugin, a writer and a painter who found their "mission" late
    in life, but still followed them -- they dropped out of their jobs
    in insurance and banking, deserted their families, and took of to
    pursue a <strong>dream</strong>. Not that this was responsible behavior, you
    understand, but the theme of the song was the power of dreams, and
    I wanted to make the point that it's never too late, and it's not
    over until....etc.<p.
      The little vignettes in the verses are not specifically 
<strong>about</strong>
   those people, but were inspired by them as true-life examples. The
   young musician verse is more of a composite, based on so many
   small-town kids who follow that musical dream. An old story, but
   often enough a true one as well. (I'm here to tell you.)<p>
     "Middletown Dreams" came to represent a kind of "litmus test" for
   me -- the way people interpret that song shows how they look at
   life. Although this was not intended, it appears that I left those
   little stories vague enough that some people interpret them as
   representing *failure*, and that I was writing a <strong>pessimistic</strong>
   song. I call this the "Tragic View."  Whereas, as you can see, I
   was actually writing about dreams <strong>fulfilled</strong>, and this is called
   the "Romantic View."

<strong>
Q.  Inside the flap of your <em>Roll The Bones</em> tour program contains the
    morse code message "remember death." Why?
</strong><br>

    This gets heavy, so bear with me... The cover art reflects a style
 of 17th century Dutch painting called <strong>vanitas</strong>, in which symbols,
 such as the skull (and also candles, books flowers, playing cards,
 etc.), were used to remind the good Netherlanders of life's brevity,
 and the ultimate transience of all material things and sensual
 pleasures. These paintings sometimes used a latin motto: "memento
 mori," which translates as "remember death." So, as you can see, this
 is basically one of those lame intellecto-jokes, the kind that make
 your brain hurt to think about (See also the line in "Cut To The
 Chase" -- "I'm young enough to remember the future."  Like... 
<strong>What?</strong>)<p>
   But afterall, if you're not a follower of Shirley MacLaine, how can
 you "remember death?"  You can only remember that it's there. (And
 that's a big <strong>rip-off</strong>.)

<strong>
Q.1  Since you quoted the line "Now I lay me down in dreamland," I
     assume that someone else came up with it. If this is true, which
     writer came up with it, and in what book or poem of his or hers
     can it be found?<br>
Q.2  Is it true that you guys were offered the sound-track for the
     movie <em>Batman</em>?<br>
Q.3  Is there any humor to be found on the cover for <em>Presto</em>? If so,
     please let me in on it.

1/   It's more a paraphrase than a quote, really, but it comes from a
   prayer which was stitched into a sampler above my grandmother's
   bed. It began like this: "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the
   Lord my soul to keep..." When I came up with the line for "Second
   Nature," I pictured it with a kind of self-mocking smile, of irony,
   and of facing reality rather than ideals, so I put it in quotes.<p>

2/   No, it's not true.<p>

3/   Isn't it awful when you have to explain your jokes? It's so
  awkward when the joke fails, and people insist you try -- no one ever
  laughs at the *explanation* of a joke. Anyway, the idea was that
  these bunnies are taking matters into their *own*, um...paws, and
  making *themselves* appear from the hat, and flying around in it. Go
  on -- laugh your head off!

 Um...part <strong>four</strong> of a <strong>trilogy</strong>, get it? See

<strong>
Q.1   Any reason for your playing with your sticks upside-down
      sometimes?<br>
Q.2   Is there any particular order to the numbers on the dice on the
      cover of <em>Roll The Bones?</em>
</strong><br>

<dl><dd>
1/   When I was starting out, if I broke the tips off my sticks I
   couldn't afford to buy new ones, so I would just turn them around
   and use the other end. I got used to it, and continue to use the
   heavy end of lighter sticks -- it gives me a solid impact, but with
   less "dead weight" to sling around.<p>

2/   No order -- just descending into chaos. (This is also for Michael
   Splawn, with the U.S. Army in Kaiserslauten, Germany, who asked
   about the dice as well.)

  This question actually came to me through <strong>Modern 
Drummer</strong> a couple of
years back, but with no address, so I'm hoping it will make it back to
Roy through <strong>this</strong> forum. In answer to that long-ago question, 
no I didn't, but I have a lot of respect for the complexities of modern
drum-corp playing, and of course, I started out with the same 26
rudiments they do, and sometimes use that style of playing when it
suits the music.

<strong>
Q.   It's fairly well known that you've been influenced to a great
     extent by the writings of Ayn Rand. Knowing that her philosophy
     places a great deal of emphasis on individualism and creative
     integrity, particularly in the realm of art, how do you reconcile
     this with the fact that the music of Rush is written collectively?
     What happens if one of you has your heart set on a particular
     part, but the other two are dead-set against it?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
                                                 Eric Simpson<br>
                                                 Miami Springs, FL</font><p>

<dl><dd>
   Well, I saved this one until last, and you can see why! Eric and
other people often send long lists of questions, and I hope they
understand that I just can't justify spending half a page on a complex
answer for each arcane question (for myself <strong>or</strong> for the general
reader) so I have to be selective. Since I'm giving my time to this as
a service to others, I go about it in my <strong>own</strong> way -- like the selfish
bum I am.<p>
   Sometimes I choose questions which a <strong>few</strong> people have asked about,
but which are unlikely to appear in an interview; sometimes I choose
questions I think are interesting; sometimes I head off a growing myth
and debunk it for you; other times I just say "what the heck" and
answer any old one. So okay...<p>
   For a start. the extent of my influence by the writings of Ayn Rand
should not be overestimated -- I am no one's disciple. Yes, I believe
the individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty, but in
philosophy, as Aristotle said long ago, the paramount good is
<strong>happiness</strong>.  My self-determination as an individual is <strong>part</strong> of the
pursuit of happiness, of course, but there's more to it than that.<p>
   In this particular example, working together with Alex and Geddy is
a more important part of my pursuit of happiness than is my attachment
to any line of lyric or phrase of music. Thus the conflict you
describe would not arise -- if we disagree on such a detail, we work on
it until it satisfies <strong>everybody</strong>, and if (very) occasionally one of
us has to sacrifice a petty preference, they hey -- it's no big deal.
Especially when you compare such an issue against the satisfaction we
get from the <strong>big</strong> picture, the sum of our work together, it would be
foolish to sacrifice long-term happiness for a small difference in
taste.<p>
   I've said before that in regard to my own work, the lyrics, I am
more often <strong>excited</strong> by the input from the other two than I am
<strong>disappointed</strong> by it, and I certainly never feel 
<strong>compromised</strong> by it.<p>
   And there you can see how complicated it is to identify and pursue
happiness, and how complicated it can be just to answer one question
(out of <strong>twenty</strong> submitted by the curious Mr. Simpson, though others
often rival him.)<p>
   You see what I'm up against...<p>
