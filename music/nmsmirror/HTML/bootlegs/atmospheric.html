<strong>Sound Quality:</strong> 9+<br>
<strong>Packaging:</strong> 7<br>
<p>
This is probably the best audience Roll the Bones boot out of all those 
released so far. It even surpasses Over the Europe in terms of quality. And 
in spite of what was originally thought, those two boots <strong>ARE</strong> 
separate shows.<p>

The guitar and vocals are very sharp (including the backing vocals that Alex
does!), the drums solid, although the bass can be a bit hard to hear. Even the
intermission music (before "Show Don't Tell" for example) stands out, as does
the "surround" parts ("I will be the judge"). One slightly annoying
thing are the fans -- very loud and obnoxious, but luckily only during the
first couple of songs. They must've been told someone was recording the show
:-)<p>

One other thing that is nice (or annoying) is that every, and I mean EVERY 
song is indexed. Intermission music and song medleys included.

Packaging is a bit weak, but does contain some nice shots of the band during
the RTB tour. I especially like the back photo of Geddy & Alex playing
together! The cds themselves are very unique, having an ancient calendar on
them. Not quite Rush-related, but it seems like something they'd've put inside
Counterparts. <p>

Overall, a sharp-sounding show, well worth checking out, and the best 
audience RTB show out!<p>
