I looked in the toilet today<br>
My breakfast stared right back at me<br>
I'd lost some major chunks<br>
I think I'm , I'm gonna toss<br>
I think I'm gonna toss!<p>

Oooh, it seems like only late last night<br>
I was sitting and eating spam-and-cheese on white<br>
Grape tamales, and grits so jolly<br>
But now I'm all so blotto<br>
All I feel is vertigo!<p>

I get up out of bed<br>
Digested food rising to my head<br>
I dive in just in time<br>
To share last night's pork rinds!<br>
Go wild!<p>

Once I loved raw hamburger<br>
Mixed with eggs and a touch of tobasco!<br>
Once I would inhale molasses<br>
If they were stirred with rabbit droppings<br>
But then chunks would fly<br>
And I'd have to decide<br>
If I wanted to use it for ice cream toppings<br>
No more passersby gawking!<p>

My chow time's woefully bad<br>
Glancing at the porcelain throne just makes me sad!<br>
But just as I think my life's a wreck<br>
I eye the eggnog and the Chex!<br>
Yeah!<p>
