Venerable Rush up to speed after working vacation
</font><br>
<strong>By Salvatore Caputo</strong>, Staff writer<p>

Rush didn't rush to put out its current album, <strong>Test For 
Echo</strong>. The Canadian trio -- vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex
Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart -- took a sabbatical for 1 1/2 years after its
last tour ended in May 1994.<p>

The band, which combines complex, often bombastic, hard-rocking instrumental
forays with songs that beg for Lee's distinctive voice, is good to itself. Let
other groups tour in summer -- Rush stays home to enjoy the family and good
weather. "quality time" breaks like that help keep a group together for the
long haul, and Rush's haul has been 22 years since its self-titled debut album
was released.<p>

Still, 1 1/2 years was the longest break the three had ever taken, tough for a
group accustomed to working on a fairly regular schedule.<p>

"It's not like we went and laid on the beach or anything," says Peart, calling
in from a tour stop in San Jose.<p>

"Geddy wanted some paternity leave, and then I got involved studying and
practicing, and I wanted more time to pursue that before we started working
on a new record, so I pushed it back a little further for those reasons."<p>

When <strong>Test for Echo</strong> was released this September, the total
wait since <strong>Counterparts</strong> had been about three years, the
longest gap in Rush's discography. The time off was worth it, as the album
displays a rejuvenated band.<p>

Fans might be surprised that Peart, as accomplished as he'd been with Rush's
complex rhythmic approach, would want time off to study and practice, but he
was unsatisfied with his playing.<p>

"In this generation of drummers we've had to deal with mathematics, with click
tracks (metronomic pulses meant to synchronize recordings) and drum machines
and sequencers and stuff that made things pretty rigid.<p>

"And I found, for myself, I was feeling that rigidity as a player. all got
really stiff and linear, and as a listener, too, I didn't like the way it
sounded. It sounded stiff and uncomfortable."<p>

He didn't know what he was looking for but found it by accident during the
time off. While Lee was spending time with his family and new daughter and
Lifeson was recording a solo album called <strong>Victor</strong>, Peart
produced <strong>Burning for Buddy</strong>, an album to honor the late jazz
drummer Buddy Rich.<p>

He was taken with some changes in the playing of Steve Smith, one of the
drummers who worked on the tribute.<p>

"He was always a great drummer," Peart says of Smith, "but suddenly he had
this fluidity and sheer musicality about his playing that just knocked me
down."<p>

So Peart asked Smith for his secret, and it turned out to be a 70-year-old
jazz drummer named Freddy Gruber.<p>

Peart likens Gruber's lessons to the approach of a professional tennis
player's coach.<p>

"The coaches don't teach them how to play the game," he says. "They watch the
way they move, and say, 'Well, you know your serve could be better if you
raised your elbow.'<p>

"And it's this kind of thing that Freddy does. 'Raise the drum higher and hold
your hand like this and move your arm like that and move your feet this way'
and demonstrating that it is supposed to be a dance on drums, you're not
supposed to be driving nails."<p>

Peart sees the experience as part of the band's maturing process. It's no
secret that the band's earliest music featured flowery, "cosmic" lyrics and
that the instrumental part was often complex technically just to show off the
band's chops rather than to serve the compositions.<p>

"In the early days, you want to show off, and if you learn how to do
something, you'll stick it in the song, whether it fits there or not," Peart
says. "To me, that's cool. That's youthful exuberance, and I don't think that
should be criticized in too serious of a way.<p>

"It almost always leads to a confidence in a craft that makes those things
unnecessary."<p>

As the band's lyricist (he says nobody else in the group wanted the job),
Peart also feels his words have become more direct.<p>

"I'm still talking about the same kind of issues, but I'll try to take a
universal idea and make it personal," he says. "That's something that it took
me a couple of decades to develop the ability to do as a songwriter...<p>

"That's what the best of songwriting is -- something that's apparently simple,
if you chose to investigate further, suddenly has greater depth."<p>

<font size=+1>RUSH, Rush, rush echoes its raw power</font><br>
<strong>Larry Rodgers</strong><p>

        In its first tour in more than 2 years, rock power-trio Rush is
taking to heart the title of its new album, Test For Echo.<p>

        The signal came back loud and clear from an appreciative audience
Friday at the America West Arena as the Canadian band dished out an array of
tunes from its latest effort, as well as hits from 20-plus years.<p>

        The 1996 version of Rush sports a stripped-donw sound, with
vocalist-bassist Geddy Lee turning less to the synthesizer than in the past.
This allows more room for fun-loving guitar maestro Alex Lifeson and
superdrummer Neil Peart to shine.<p>

        After a rousing version of past hit The Big Money early on, Rush
settled into an electrifying first set featuring songs from Test for Echo,
including the driving Driven and Limbo, in which Lifeson unleashed some
savage licks. Half the world was played against an innovative video, as were
most other songs.<p>

        Later in the three-hour show, the band hedged its bets with older
favorites, including a soaring Freewill, as well as the obligatory Tom
Sawyer and Closer to the Heart.<p>

When Rush hits on all cylinders, as it did most of the night, you'd have to
go back to the days of Cream to find a rock trio that delivered as much
power onstage.<p>
