<em>September 19, 1991</em>
<p>

Like a million little dance clubs<br>
all the choices we made<br>
all the bouncers we got past<br>
all the songs that they played<p>

So many different directions<br>
Our separate paths might have turned<br>
With all the feet we've stepped on<br>
every person we've burned<p>

Somehow we find each other<br>
through all that masquerade<br>
somehow we find each other<br>
somehow we have stayed<br>
In the same damn place<p>

I don't believe in  DENSITY<br>
or the mystery of blind date<br>
I don't believe in forever<br>
or the club as a mystical place<p>

I don't believe in the lights or the sound<br>
or the DJ watching from above<br>
But I believe if you Ask Me To Dance<br>
We can push and then shove<br>
and make it last...<p>
