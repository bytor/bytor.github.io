A Show of Hands</font><br>
by Bill Reynolds<p>
<em>Taken from <b>Canadian Musician</b> -- February 1989</em><p>

Rush is the band with the attitude, 'I've got licks and I'm gonna use 'em!'
From their early days as an extreme hard rock trio to their pre-eminence at
the top of the heap in the eighties, they've always delivered to their loyal
fans music that will never bow to top 40 tastes. Their albums have become
increasingly melodic, but they reserve their right as players to 'strut
their stuff' as often as possible.<p>

Rush's mastering of technology over the years, along with the desire to
overcome the pretentious stigma of being 'composers' has resulted in a
series of more sophisticated and melodic recordings, culminating with <b>Hold
Your Fire</b> in 1987. As is their custom, every fifth LP is live, and <b>A 
Show of Hands</b>, the third such release of their career, is out this month.<p>

Bassist, singer and reluctant keyboardist Geddy Lee, who has never spent so
much continuous time at home as he has these last six months, stopped by the
Anthem record offices to discuss where the band has been, the making of both
the film and the record of the last two tours, and to hypothesize on the
future prospects of a band that has worked hard to deserve the respect and
success it has received, a band that shows absolutely no signs of flagging
in the stretch.<p>

Lee is a quiet and thoughtful kind of guy. He peruses questions carefully
before providing articulate answers that usually get to the root of his, and
his band's, mindset at any given point in their musical life. If it seems
slightly indulgent to release a third double live album, Lee points out that
it's a formula which has served to provide a spell of rejuvenation for the
creative juices of the band.<p>

"It makes sense to us because it buys time from the rigours of touring, and
it's a historical update. It's appropriate every once in a while to record
how your sound has changed and evolved over the years. It's also very
instructional, because it can be very painful listening to live tapes. All
musicians are infinitely more hypercritical of themselves than would be the
general public. But eventually you get past that stage of noticing the
little mistakes and start thinking about the stuff you're really proud of. 
It's like taking stock of your abilities as a player."<p>

Rush completed their <b>Hold Your Fire</b> tour last winter, but work on the
record hadn't even begun. They had 40 hours of tape to sift through, and
what began in the minds of the Anthem people as a quick two-week exercise
quickly ballooned to six. The live recordings were spread over the last two
tours, including Power Windows in 1985. The band made the decision to tape
as many shows because of their experiences with the last two, <b>All The
World's A Stage</b> (1976) and <b>Exit... Stage Left</b> (1981).<p>

Lee says of the first live recording, "It was very raw. Our sound was like
that in those days anyway, and we did very little fixing up or knob
twiddling. We were growing so fast that by the time it came out we thought
we could have done better. As a consequence it was very difficult for us to
listen to, even though it was immensely popular."<p>

Onward to 1981: when they decided to redress the balance for <b>Exit... Stage
Left</b>, they convinced themselves that it would be appropriate to eliminate
the ambience of the crowd in favour of technical accuracy. The lack of
audience involvement made it too sterile for the effect intended. Lee says,
"We were trying to keep every hair in place. We were being naive and missed
the point."<p>

With <b>A Show Of Hands</b>, Rush feels it has achieved the happy medium -- a live
document that is technically impressive to listen to, but at the same time
retains the buzz of the crowd. To achieve the vibrancy they were so badly
searching for, they reasoned that if they recorded dozens of shows, they
would find a few moments that transcended the uptightness of having the tape
machine on. "We were trying to find those comfortable takes. We were
splitting ourselves into two, playing for the tape and the audience. If you
make a tiny mistake, in your mind you feel you've blown it, and you get
uptight. It's a very psychological thing."<p>

Ironically, after hours and hours of taping, the loosest gig was on the last
night of the <b>Hold Your Fire</b> tour. They played three nights running in
Birmingham, England, the second of which was being filmed for a simultaneous 
release. Lee explains, "We had 10 cameras around the stage, big cranes, guys 
all trying to be discreet, but in no way being discreet. Talk about being 
uptight! Worried about the recording? Forget it! You got cameras stuck in 
your face."<p>

The next night the whole band was completely relaxed, because the camera
crews were doing only longshots, and they couldn't even see them. The tape
was running, but they were just happy to be without pots in their face. In
the end they went with their instincts in choosing final versions, reasoning
that any serious mistake could easily be corrected in the studio, whereas
essence was a more difficult quality to come by.<p>

SRO-Anthem V.P. Val Azzoli says the band was very concerned about paying
attention to CD technology with this LP. They wanted to give fans a break
because it's a live recording, so they put the double LP on a single CD,
filling all but 12 seconds of the 74-minute physical restriction. He says,
"everybody was freakin' out about that. 'You can't do this!' Why not? 'Well,
it's never been done before.' So what? They wanted two CDs so they could
charge $40 instead of $20. They were just being greedy. It was like, 'Stop
already! It's a live record! Let's give 'em more for their money.' that
would have been pure profit for the record company and the retailers, profit
which we wouldn't have seen, but we won that battle."<p>

With the LP mixed and ready to go, Lee figured it would be a breeze to
finish the movie soundtrack, but instead he was slaving away for another
four weeks getting that second night in Birmingham up to snuff. "I naively
thought we could use the same takes from the LP, but as consistent and
automatic as we sometimes are, it wouldn't work." Azzoli wants to see the
concert film released in conjunction with the record to selected repertory
cinemas in North America for a limited run. It will eventually find its home
on the video racks, like the other films.<p>

Rush's shows are usually 130 minutes, but the film gives a slightly
condensed version at 95. While the LP draws mostly from material on the last 
couple of records, the film is a real concert with a definite beginning and 
end. Howard Ungerleider. Rush's wizard lighting director, used a few tricks, 
like adding a couple of white spotlights, to provide more clarity with 
background silhouettes. Because there is so much trouble with transferring 
the colour red from live to film, and especially video, special precautions 
had to be taken. Lee thinks Rush finally has been captured in its essence 
onstage. "It's a new experience for me because I've never really seen the 
show, but we tried very hard to get the atmosphere and wonderful moods Howard 
creates."<p>

The incredibly complex procedures required to execute Rush's stage show have
developed because the band heartily embraced technology many years ago. It
all began innocently enough, with their desire to have Lee play rhythm
guitar while guitarist Alex Lifeson performed solos. They introduced the
bass pedals in the seventies to facilitate Lee playing two instruments
simultaneously, and since then have never looked back. As Lee says, "It's
like the little thing that grew. We became addicted to the idea of having an
extra member in the band without having an extra member. Now almost every
limb I have is connected to something."<p>

Lee says at times he feels very constrained by the banks of keyboards,
sequencers, sampling devices and MIDI control devices, mainly because he'll 
always consider himself a bassist first, a singer second, and a keyboard 
player a distant third. "I consider myself, if anything, a synthesizer 
arranger, almost a choreographer. I do a lot of writing on the keyboard, 
and then I use the Performer software with the MacIntosh computer. Before any 
other instruments are put down on tape, the keyboard arrangements, except for
the subtleties, are final. But with live performances it's a whole different
story."<p>

Jim Burgess of Saved By Technology convinced Lee that the complexities of a
Rush studio recording could indeed be recreated live. Offstage someone will
set up the samples for the songs, but Lee triggers them himself. "It's very
important for me to do that. and not someone else. It's a fine line, but I
still have to be in the right place at the right time. If I hit a sequencer
late, it's my fault. That way, I'm still in control, and my organization and
rhythm have to be impeccable."<p>

For Lee, the restricting aspect of being in charge of so many split-second
decisions is that it takes him away from his natural role as 'the player'.
He is pleased to still be able to write aggressive tunes like "Force Ten" on
the bass guitar and know they couldn't possibly have been written on his
keyboard. It's then that he realizes the true usefulness of the keyboard as
an arranging device. "That technology is amazing because it's like having 30
extra colours to work with, but at the same time we maintain a central idea
of what we want at all times. Rush is a constantly evolving concept of what
a hard rock band is how many people we can pretend to be at the same time."<p>

With the ever-present use of keyboards comes texture and the inevitable
richness that accompanies it. Lee is surprised when the word mellow is used
to describe Rush's music now in comparison to a few years ago, mainly
because he can't see working with Lifeson, whom he describes as a ferocious
guitar player, in a mellow band. But he does allow that Rush has become
preoccupied with melody over the years.<p>

He considers the first stage of Rush to be raw and energetic. "The
temperament was 'I've got licks to play that I want people to hear.' It was
a cocky, strut-yourstuff attitude, and my singing was extreme too because I
had to cut through that. But I don't have a desire to belt it out like I
used to. The older you get as a person, the more you get to know yourself,
and you want to use those things. And so here we are, the same band 15 years
down the road -- a rarity in itself -- and we're not opposed to letting our
growth as people and the new music that's around influence us.<p>

It's important for Lee to make sure he writes a good melody for his voice
now, one which can highlight the various moods and effects of which he's
capable. It may be a sign of maturity, or it may simply mean the band has
the luxury to stretch out and spend more time on each project. In the early
days Rush never recorded demos.<p>

Whenever they had three weeks off between tours they'd get in there and see
how much they could lay down before heading out again. The band now works as
hard as ever, but more energy goes into the process of recording rather than
busting their asses to break the American market.<p>

Azzoli says the band doesn't necessarily agree with him, but he thinks the
change in the group over the last few albums is radical. He says, "The 
lyrical content and the music reflect their lifestyle. They used to grind it 
out doing 200 dates a year. Now their families have grown a little, and 
they've become more reflective of their surroundings.<p>

Lee says the original impetus was to 'cement' a pile of riffs together and
get out in front of people. They considered themselves players and wouldn't
be caught dead calling themselves anything so pretentious as 'composers'.
But with more experience (and more success) they can now afford the time to
indulge in something they weren't nearly as concerned with originally, the
art of songwriting. Lee says, "It's something we want to excel at. It has
really shifted our focus, spending more time doing sketches before the final 
painting."<p>

Of course, this is Rush we're talking about here, and Lee is at pains to
remind everyone that they are still a trio, with all that extra room to get
all the licks in. "That's our biggest connection with our hardcore fans, and
why we never make top 40 radio. We can write a conventional song, but
inevitably there comes that weird part in a strange time signature, or what
Andrew Jackson, the respected English arranger who worked on our last album,
calls 'the nutty bit'."<p>

What goes around may come back again, surmises Azzoli, because apparently
Rush is getting antsy from hanging around the house for so long. They've
discovered they don't much like what they're hearing on the radio in their 
spare time. Azzoli says, "This is the first time Ged's been home for six 
months straight in 20 years. That's a long time. I dunno what this new album, 
which will be due out at the end of the year, will be like, but Ged's saying 
stuff like, 'God is this radio now? Come on! No one's kicking ass anymore! "'<p>

With Lee getting his frustrations pent-up by not touring them out of his
system, and Lifeson experiencing a flashback to his past through producing
another Anthem act, Clean Slate, the time may be ripe for Rush to shed some
of that orchestral skin, now that they've wrapped up the last five years
with <b>A Show Of Hands</b>.<p>

Azzoli explains Lifeson's producing role this way: "I wanted him to get back
to, 'Hey listen, we got eight dollars to make this record. We can't record
in Monserrat and Paris and Istanbul. We got a dingy little studio at 40
dollars an hour. Ya got three weeks. You're not gonna sleep... Remember
this?' By doing that he realizes all he's got is a guitar, an amp and a
lotta coffee, just like the old days in between tours."<p>

Azzoli says Lifeson got really pumped up with the streamlining of the
production process. "He's now in the mood of, 'Hey I got an idea, fuck the
outboard gear, I'm back to guitar and fingers!' And Ged's in that mode too,
because he's gone back to writing on bass which is, by definition, brasher."<p>

Whichever direction Rush decides to take when they return to recording late
this winter, it won't be toward the snoozerama of so much of today's radio.
Putting on his fast-talking, record company gunslinger persona, Azzoli moans, 
"Right now we're in this homogenous zone of the most boring fucking music 
I've heard in my life. Radio is not listening to the kids, which is a 
fundamental mistake society is making as well. A 35-year old mother dresses 
the same way and listens to the same music as her 15-year-old daughter, and 
that's not right.  It's just one big happy consumer group, all sitting around 
in Polo looking hip."<p>

It's not all doom and gloom, however, because Azzoli figures that the
archetypal guitar-bass-drums rock 'n' roll band will never leave the
spotlight. He says that this particular concept of music has stood the test
of time. "Three guys playing their instruments and expressing their
discontent with society will never die, because those three instruments 
have always been perfect for that emo tional and physical release."<p>

Over the years Rush has pretty much be come an institution, or least a
paragon, of the ideal power trio format. Looking back, Lee, says it never
even occurred to him that he had a career until a friend pointed it out to
him as recently as a couple of years ago. "We always looked upon it as a
long term thin, but I never connected that with the idea of 'careen' then my
friend said, 'You know, you do have a career. A lot of bands break up after
a while.' But I guess we're like Sammy Davis Jr. (laughs). He didn't get
into it to make couple of records either. That's not to say we'll always be
in the public eye, or always be a touring band, but as long as the
collaboration between the three people is rewarding, we'll keep at it."<p>
