<font size=+1>Bucking the trends, Rush rides the crest of 'Permanent 
Waves'</font><br>
<b>by Lynn Van Matre</b><p>

"It wouldn't seem that the times are right for our music, no," acknowledged
drummer Neil Peart of Rush, the low-profile, high-decibel Canadian rock trio
whose latest album recently moved into the headier regions of the best-seller
charts. "But then" Peart added, "you'd think that a band like Pink Floyd
would be too obscure for the times, too, and look at them -- they're at the
top of the charts."<p>

On a 1980 music scene long on short, pithy pop tunes, Rush turns out mostly
lengthy, quasi-mystical or philosophical songs on such topics as "Free Will,"
"The Spirit of Radio," and "Natural Science," the last a three-part affair
about "art as expression, not as market campaigns." Past albums have attempted
science-fiction rock opera and reflected songwriter Peart's interest in the
literary works of Ayn Rand; before that, the band carried on its pounding
power trio approach long after it ceased to be fashionable.<p>

Rush would rate high on very few "bands of the '80s" lists, it would seem; its
sound is neither fashionably spare nor couched in the catchy hooks that
capture the ears of radio programmers. But while there's little doubt that
it's the newer wave of bands that snares the lion's share of attention these
days -- at least among the media -- the fact is, in many cases it's the bands
considered by some of the more intolerantly trend-conscious to be outdated
"dinosaurs" that are coming out the big winners.<p>

Pink Floyd's marvelously lush and spacey sound, born in the late '60s and
served up again and again by the band throughout the '70s, may indeed be
anachronistic; but the magic still works. The band's newest release, "The
Wall," a double-record concept album espousing the Floyd's oft-repeated theme
of rock star as bitter victim, is currently the best-selling album in America
and has been for some weeks. And right now, three notches below it, in fourth
place, ranks Rush, enjoying their greatest commercial success in their
half-dozen years together -- partly because of the airplay accorded "The
Spirit of Radio," a single from the album, and partly, Peart would like to
believe, "because, regardless of whether we fit in with today's trends in
music or not, the vitality is still very strong.<p>

"And if you've got that vitality, I don't think the stylistic form of music
matters," continued Peart, who will appear in concert with Rush vocalist and
bass man Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson Thursday through next Sunday at
the International Amphitheatre. "It doesn't make any difference whether you're
doing white reggae or the resurrected '50s rock that most new wave music is
made up of, or an ongoing thing like we represent, a permanent wave that isn't
affected by styles."<p>

Given Peart's reasoning, the band's current album is called, appropriately
enough, "Permanent Waves." The name is, indeed, a poke at the new wave scene,
"but not necessarily the bands themselves," Peart added. "There are many new
wave groups we enjoy and respect, like Talking Heads and Elvis Costello and
Joe Jackson. Really, the joke was aimed more at the press, especially the
English rock press that is inclined to write off any band that was around last
week and go for whatever's happening *this* week."<p>

In the United States, Rush's reputation is largely that of a band written off
by the rock press, a group that can garner respectable crowds of faithful
followers but few favorable reviews ("Boasts a vocalist who sounds like a
cross between Donald Duck and Robert Plant... the power boogie band for the 16
Magazine graduating class," sneered a review of Rush's record output in "The
Rolling Stone Record Guide"). Peart professed puzzlement with that particular
belief about the band.<p>

"It's true, most people have the impression that we get only bad press," he
said. "We do get bad reviews, but we get good ones, too. I have scrapbooks
full of wonderful ones at home. But people do tend to think the press always
dumps on us. I don't know why. As for interviews, we've always done a certain
amount of those, too, and I like doing them, though it's never been a thing
that we've made any sacrifices for. We've just never forced ourselves to be
that strongly public relations-oriented. We spend most of our time on the
road, playing in front of people, and we have a direct one-to-one relationship
with people that way. We play our music for people, and they like it and buy
our records. To me, that's the only thing that really works."<p>

The rule in rock is that most bands tour to promote the sales of their albums
and look forward tot he day when they can take more time off the road; Rush,
Peart insisted, is one of the exceptions.<p>

"To me, the work has to be seen as the end product," he explained. "I'm not
working toward some goal of success. What I'm doing now is what I've always
wanted to do. We've been at it for six years now, and I still like the work
part. I get fed up with being on the road, but it has nothing to do with the
performing. It has to do with the unnecessary garbage that happens in the
other 22 hours of the day. When it comes down to those two hours that we stand
onstage and play, I still enjoy them a lot."<p>

Peart's interest in music dates back to his teen-age years; growing up in a
small town near Toronto, he was initially excited by the Who, then moved on to
such late-'60s acts as Cream, Led Zeppelin, Jeff Beck, and Jimi Hendrix.<p>

"There was so much anger expressed during that period, and so much sincerity,"
recalled Peart, who dropped out of school at 17 to try to make it as a
musician. "That was what I responded to, that feeling that there was something
genuine being expressed by people like Peter Townsend. When he wrote a song,
he knew how to express frustration and desire. And I think that a lot of the
values and standards that we have in Rush are the same as the values that
people stood for in the late '60s -- being true to the idea that, when you
write a song, you don't worry about whether it's suitable for airplay or
commercial enough.<p>

"A lot of bands buckle under to those kinds of pressures. The record company
tells them to make their next album more commercial or they won't put it out,
and the bands do, because it's like if they don't, it's the end. They don't
have enough faith in their work to stand up to that rap. I would rather just
say goodbye at that point. I can do other things. I've worked in stores and
done odd jobs before, and I could do it again.<p>

"We've had plenty of people in the music business tell us to make our songs
shorter and more commercial," he continued. "Those people aren't thinking in
terms of a long-term career for us; we are. We want to do this for a good
number of years, until we decide it's time to give it up. But for most record
companies, the ideal is a band that makes it fast. An example with our record
company (Mercury Records) would be Bachman Turner Overdrive. They lasted about
two years, sold millions of records, then faded out. They were a quick
investment, and the company didn't have to spend much money making them
successful. For us, it took four albums before we started to break even, and
record companies aren't interested in that.<p>

"Now we're at the point where we can say 'Shut up, it's none of your business'
to people who would try to tell us how to work," Peart said. "For a long time,
though, we had to fight like hell."<p>

While their recent commercial successes may have solved some problems, the
band could do without at least one aspect of Rush's higher profile.<p>

"We've noticed on this tour that there are a lot more weirdoes coming out of
the woodwork," mused Peart, a family man who likes his privacy. "We could
start a 'Flake of the Week' club. We get a lot of guy sending us pictures of
themselves and telling us they want to 'help us out' -- they don't want to
*take over*, they just want to 'do us a favor' by singing backup and doing
some original dance routines. And all kinds of people send us letters saying
that they have a plan to save the world and all they need is our help. Or they
come up to us and say they've read all our lyrics and know exactly what we're
saying and they're the only ones in the world that do. People extract amazing
interpretations out of things. Someone told me one of my songs was about me
going to search for God and finding Him. Yeah, right. Sure.<p>

"There's a good portion of our audience, just like any other group of people,
that we simply have no point of relationship with, and you just have to accept
that," he continued. "But then there's the ideal fan, the person who
appreciates every move we make and knows if we make a mistake and acts as kind
of a built-in judge factor. Those are the people we write our songs for."<p>
