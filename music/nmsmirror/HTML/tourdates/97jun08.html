<font size=+1>Rushing back into the spotlight after an 18-month
hiatus, Rush is back with a new sound and new tour</font><br>
<b>by Alan Sculley</b><p>

Rush is far from the only group giving the 1997 summer concert
season a distinct 1970s rock accent. But unlike contemporaries
such as Styx, Supertramp or Boston -- all of which are back in
action after personnel changes or temporary breakups -- Rush is
one of the few bands of the era to have stayed intact and
continuously recorded and toured. <p>

This fact is not lost on drummer Neil Peart. <p>

"When we got together, did we ever think about 20 years down the
line? No way," he said emphatically. "In fact, on our first tour we
collected souvenirs and so on, thinking it might be the last. You
dare not take anything for granted. I think another contribution to
our longevity is that we've never taken ourselves for granted, and
we've never taken our career for granted or our fans or anything.
It's always been a fresh battle every time." <p>

The latest challenge for Rush was their recent CD, "Test For
Echo," the 16th studio record for the Canadian trio, which also
includes bassist/singer Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson. <p>

The new CD follows an 18-month hiatus -- the longest break the
band has ever taken from recording and touring. In that time Peart
worked on a tribute album to drummer Buddy Rich, Lifeson made
a solo record (as "Victor") and Lee became a father of a baby girl. <p>

And when the trio reconvened in October 1995 to begin work on a
new CD at Chalet Studio near Toronto, some subtle changes had
occurred to alter the way they worked together. <p>

Within Rush, Lee and Lifeson write the music, while Peart handles
the lyrics. But for "Test For Echo," Lifeson, fresh from the Victor
project, arrived ready to make a greater impact than ever before. <p>

"I think this time it was harder for them (Lee and Lifeson) to find a
new balance because Alex was coming back with a new level of
confidence and involvement and wanted to assert that," Peart said.
"They had to find a new dynamic between them than they'd had in
the past. So it is more difficult." <p>

Things apparently didn't always go smoothly. <p>

"Any time there's a truly collaborative piece of work where you
have to create on the spot in the same room together, I think that's
a difficult situation," Peart said. "So I kind of empathize with what
they have to go through with that, but it certainly works, and it's
fortunate that they've been friends so long that they can weather
nearly any kind of a difficult patch." <p>

The finished product suggests that Lee, Lifeson and Peart found a
workable balance. "Test For Echo" retains the complex,
progressive rock sound established with well-known songs like
"Tom Sawyer" or "The Spirit Of Radio," but it does have its
shades of difference -- particularly in scaling back keyboards to
emphasize more of a guitars/bass/drums sound. <p>

"On this record, I was certainly very focused on drum set playing,
but at the same time, I never closed the door on electronics," Peart
said. "I had my samplers and all the pads and stuff sitting there if
they were required. But the songs as they came about simply didn't
require that. So very often just the songs themselves dictate which
way to go." <p>

With Solos And Lasers, The Rush Is On</font><br>
<strong>by Michael Kuelker</strong><p>

In the spirit of Rush, and as a throwback to the golden age of rock's
concept suites (which would be the 1970s), I am titling this review "Banshee 
Aria: Geddy's Monster Throb Descends Upon Maryland Heights." Or perhaps 
"Histrionica: Let the Solos Begin."<p>

Rush made its second pass on the "Test for Echo" tour, playing a long,
uproariously received concert here Sunday night.<p>

The trio, which has maintained its membership since 1974, hasn't lost a
beat. Geddy Lee plunked a Morse code of basslines, Neil Peart provided very 
busy end fills, and Alex Lifeson lent rhythmic heft. It was characteristic 
Rush.<p>

The Rush concept song of the '70s meant puzzles of music with esoteric
titles and was never long in turning into a guitar-hero, or bass-hero or 
drum-hero part. Today, Rush favors a tighter package, sometimes no less 
obscurely titled stuff but usually in the four- and five-minute range.  But as 
accepting as its audience is of the material the trio puts out roughly 
every two years, Rush knows it's the yowls from yore that spin the wheels of 
its concert caravan.<p>

The centerpiece of the show was "2112," the Ayn Rand-inspired opus from
1976, performed in its seven-part entirety. Nothing much has changed on that 
grim planet of the future. The priests of the Temples of Syrinx are still 
oppressive, power-mad dunderheads, and the hero's presentation of the guitar 
("Discovery") falls stupidly on their tin ears, which then necessitates 
"Oracle: The Dream" and "Soliloquy" and "The Grand Finale."<p>

Rush understands drama as much as it does power riffing -- how to gain
traction with plot and conflict, especially when they can cashier it to a 
denouement that turns on individualism and freedom through music.<p>

Canada's finest knows concert value, too. A giant video screen stretched
behind Peart, and music videos, liquidy computer graphics and newsreels beamed 
through the night. A generous, high-tech light show topped off the 
proceedings.<p>

"The Grand Finale" marked only the halfway point. After a 20-minute 
intermission, the group returned to bring on more of everything, filling out 
the evening to a three-hour festival of prog-rock triangulation and visual 
stimuli.<p>

The light show was stepped up on "Red Sector A" as green lasers beamed
by on-stage satellite dishes crisscrossed and formed holograms.<p>

Peart made a fetching sight when he lapsed into a grand mal seizure on
several banks of drums for a 10-minute solo.<p>

Lifeson proved better at rhythm than at lead guitar. His leads heave
into the shred bin too often, or they simply screech, but for the heavy metal 
riffing and atmospheric segues that are the meat-and-potatoes of Rush 
material, he is the ideal counterpart to Lee and Peart.<p>

Of the new material, "Animate" seems to create the most sparks.<p>

Among the abundant selections of older cuts that rang the audience's
chimes were "Limelight," "The Trees," "The Spirit of Radio" and "Tom 
Sawyer."<p>

Come to think of it, I'll let the air out of those pretentious review titles
I cited above and opt for something simple and heartfelt: "Rock critic sues
stinking-rich Canadians, claims to have suffered split retina from lasers."<p>
