<font size=+1>Rush To Judgement</font><br>
<b>by David Nathan</b><p>

"The first time I remember hearing the music of Rush was in the summer
of 1982.  I was 17 and working as a camp counselor.  A group of my
fellow counselors were huge Rush fans and played the band's tapes
endlessly.  It was an inescapable annoyance, and I've disliked Rush ever
since.<p>

So, when asked to do this piece for the band's upcoming show at the Cal
Expo, I said, through my dripping saliva, "Sure, I'd love the
opportunity to write about Rush."<p>

To be fair, I thought I should at least listen to the band's latest
release, "Test For Echo".  So I did.  The verdict.  Pretty
standard-issue Rush, except for a few grunge-influenced licks here and
there.  On the whole, though, nothing spectacular.<p>

In fact, it's been quite a while since Rush hit its creative peak in
1981 with "Moving Pictures", its best and most successful album.  This,
as chance would have it, was the very album that all those jerky camp
counselors kept playing over and over 14 years ago. So to say this
represents Rush's greatest work and refer to this same music as "an
inescapable annoyance" should tell you something about my feelings
towards the 40-something power pop-trio from Canada.<p>

I hate them.<p>

And this was to be my spin on the band as I awaited Geddy Lee's call
last week.  Lee, Rush's vocalist and bass player, was off to a bad start
when the phone finally rang 20 minutes after our scheduled interview
time.  Torontans are notoriously late people.<p>

Lee sounded pretty tired.  Turns out, he was calling on his off day from
the tour, and I don't think he really felt like talking to me, either.
Still, I asked him about how, if at all, he thought Rush has changed
over the years.<p>

He'd obviously heard this one before.<p>

"Well, it's been kind of a slow change from a strange band into a weird
band."<p>

I was a little surprised.  Geddy had made a funny!<p>

Feeding off this sudden burst of momentum, I reeled off another question
why Rush had taken such a long hiatus before recording "Echo."<p>

"We all needed a break," he said.  "In my personal life, my wife had a
child."  I inferred from Lee's tone that he was the father of the child
and, as is customary in these matters, congratulated him.<p>

He continued, "I won't specify any particular problems [between band
members] except the basic, 'Well, guys, we've been together for 20 years
and maybe we should take a break and make sure it's still what we want
to do.' "<p>

The reunion album, Lee declared, is "a successful attempt at stripping
down" Rush's sound.  "We've approached that in our last few records, but
I think we achieved it with this record."<p>

I'm not sure, but I think Lee was referring to the notable and merciful
departure from the overuse of keyboards on "Echo".  Many of Rush's late
1980s and early '90s discs have been watered down by needless
synthesizers, but I don't think I heard any on "Echo."<p>

As Lee continued answering boring, run-of-the-mill, "rock interview"
questions, I had an epiphany of sorts:  This Rush singer guy is pretty
cool.<p>

Unfortunately, this ruined everything.<p>

Here I was, all set to have fun making fun of Rush, the most pretentious
band in history, an easy target, and along comes
"Mr.-Down-to-Earth-Nice-Guy" Geddy Lee.  Everything he said was humble
and lovable.<p>

The lousy bastard.<p>

"What about the well-known 'Rush wuss factor'?" I asked using more
diplomatic phrasing.<p>

"Well, I don't think I ever considered us real rock 'n' roll in the
first place.  We may have rocked, but we didn't always roll," Lee said.
"As other forms of heavy rock have developed over the years, in context,
I don't think we're really that hard."<p>

He cited Bjork and Soundgarden, among others, as musicians he admires
today, and went on to offer some modest self-deprecation, humorously
referring to band member Neil Peart as "a goof," guitarist Alex Lifeson
as "an idiot" and to himself as "a jerk."<p>

I must tell you that, by this time, Lee had successfully taken the wind
right out of my sails.  I had fought him and lost.  With his jabbing
congeniality, old Geddy dropped me like a three-foot put and rolled me
out like wholesale carpeting.  And the worst of it is ... now I like
Rush!<p>

I just don't care for the music, that's all."<p>
