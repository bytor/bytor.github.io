Shoppin' here, I'm shoppin' there<br>
I'm looking for the can.<br>
There's nothing I need, nothing I want<br>
To make me feel like a man.<br>
I need it quick and I need it bad<br>
Or else I will waste away<br>
That's why I need that mystery meat<br>
Each and every day.<p>

<dl>
CHORUS<br>
<dd>
        OOO, I need some Spam<br>
        I said, I need some SPAM<br>
        OOO, I need some Spam<br>
        Packed tight with that funky clear jam<p>
</dd></dl>

Driving here, I'm driving there<br>
I've been searching for about a week.<br>
'Cause no store in my town carries the stuff<br>
And people think I'm a freak.<br>
Well, I need some Spam to keep me alive<br>
'Cause it's all I eat all day<br>
I like it fried or boiled or baked or zapped<br>
And many other ways.<p>
