<font size=+1>
After years spent scrambling to the top, Rush are not sure which path to
follow next. Maybe they'll just enjoy the view.

Rush, the little bar band that could, still thinks it can
after 14 years of rocking arenas.<p>

Trends continue to come and go, but the Toronto trio are
hardly likely to go out of fashion, for they've never been in
fashion even in England, where for years they have been
consistent winners (individually and collectively) in music press 
polls.  <p>

<em>
How many other acts have gone directly to world-touring
without ever trying either to write a hit or to cultivate an image?  
</em><p>

We're talking confidence here. This month Rush are releasing their third audio 
concert (on CD, cassette and double album), AND their second feature-length 
video concert.<p>

Once again the unmistakable voice of bassist Geddy Lee, the
consistent percussive complexity of Neil Peart, and the
characteristically brilliant playing of guitarist Alex
Lifeson confirms Rush's place as the only giant in the
Canadian rock jungle.<p>

Rush are hugely alone. Virtually all of their competitors
have capitulated. For similar proficiency you'll have to
check out the condescending cats in fusion jazz. For a
similar sense of adventure, you might look to Robert Plant,
who inspired the group when he was with Led Zeppelin.<p>

They started out by making five albums in 2 1/2 years. The
Rush ambition was first hinted at in a progressive-metal
mini-epic called "By-tor & The Snow Dog" on the second album
<strong>Fly By Night</strong>, which also introduced the inventive percussion
and lyrics of Neil Peart (replacing original drummer John
Rutsey).<p>

The breakthrough fourth album <strong>2112</strong>, was a downright Wagnerian
concept that made obvious their intention to be taken
seriously. "Attention all planets of the Solar Federation ...
We have assumed control ... "<p>

And the fifth, the first live double, showed them to be at
the head of their class. To move on they would have to
establish their own school.<p>

One year later, in September of 1977, came the first of their
great albums, <strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong>. This was not just the next
Rush album, this was the album by the next Rush. In one
mighty, artistic stroke, it separated them from their peers.
They were leaders. They would continue to have followers
(more than one million at Rush concerts in the next nine
months alone) but they would never again have imitators.<p>

For if the guts of Rush were no longer metallic, the team
still could not yet digest pop. Their spacey trip was purely
post-psychedelic; their progress no longer owed anything to
'progressive' music.<p>

After a more playful sequel called Hemispheres, though, the
turn of the decade brought a dramatic shift in the direction
of simplicity. One song on Permanent Waves was almost
entirely in 4/4 time.<p>

<strong>Moving Pictures</strong> was leaner still. Neil thinks of it as "the
<strong>Who's Next</strong> of our career." The longest track, an 11-minute
song called "The Camera Eye," was built around four insistent
notes. Aside from "Tom Sawyer," the writing was uncommonly
straightforward, though no less vivid. ("Living in a fisheye
lens / Caught in the camera eye / I have no hears to lie / l can't
pretend a stranger / Is a long-awaited friend. ")<p>

<strong>Signals</strong> and <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> continued 
their move away
from arty far-out fantasy towards artistic here-and-now
reality. They were mostly starker settings of darker
visions.<p>

Nonetheless, it was <strong>Power Windows</strong> (1985) that gave them back
their hope. Its last song begins: "So many things I think
about / When I look far away / Things I know things I wonder/
Things I'd like to say / The more we think we know about /
The greater the unknown / We suspend our disbelief / And we
are not alone. "<p>

"I'm agnostic," said Neil at the time, "but curious, and romantic enough to 
want it to be true."<p>

<strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> was hailed as the strongest album of their
career, the set of songs most likely to be imitated. But Rush
won't even imitate themselves.<p>

As Geddy sang (in Neil's words), "The things that we're
concealing / Would never let us grow / Time will do its
healing / You've got to let it go."<p>

Which is exactly what Rush have done.<p>

Alex, Geddy and Neil are part way through the longest break
of their careers. They have made no promises, not even to
each other. They have no plans ever again to do another
concert. Or not to. They haven't even decided when they are
going to make a decision.<p>

What they are doing is asking themselves hard questions about
what they are doing.<p>

"You start thinking that because you've been doing something
for a long time, you should feel guilty that you've been
doing it for so long," says Geddy. "Plus people come up to
you all the time and say, Don't you want to do something
different; And you go, well, sort of, yeah. But what do you do?
I'm not a caterpillar that can just turn into a butterfly. You
can't just snap your fingers and say, I'll change.<p>

"The reason for this break," explains Geddy, "is one of those
little awareness-moments where you realize you're burning out
on being ambitious, that you're burning out on the treadmill
of accomplishment.<p>

"You work very hard writing. You work very hard recording.
You take a token break to assume the role of husband and
father and person-involved-in-other-things. You tantalize
yourself with interests in art and architecture and baseball
and whatnot. And then you leave...<p>

"You're living one life and visiting another and trying to
teach yourself to assimilate instantly -- you get home and you try
to meld yourself into that person that you left... So we're
finally taking time to fully live a settled life."<p>

He is playing tennis with Alex and baseball with other
friends. He's reading various histories and exploring divers'
geographies. Recently he bought a cottage and is "looking for
things to put in it. It's been designated as My Project by my
benevolent wife, who is busy with her own career (she co-owns
a Toronto-based clothing design company called Zapata), and has
decorated many a home in her day, but has passed on the torch
to me ... and I'm not too shabby either."<p>

But hobbies aren't forever, it seems. After a
 while, "the game you play with yourself is how long can you stay away
 from working before you go nuts?"<p>

Neil is nuts about bicycling.<p>

An organized bicycle tour of China got him going. Since then
he and a group of friends have cycled the Alps from Munich to
Venice, the Pyrenees from Barcelona to Bordeaux and, this
past year, the Rockies from Calgary to Vancouver.<p>

He hopes that by the time you read this he will have brought
his bicycle back from a trip to Western Africa.<p>

"It's faster than walking, but still slow enough that you're
intimately connected to your surroundings," he says. "And
people are much more friendly to cyclists than to either
pedestrians or motorists -- a cyclist is obviously a harmless
eccentric."<p>

He is also working intensely on writing. He has always been
responsible for Rush lyrics; now he is concentrating on
prose. Especially travel writing. "For me it's perfect. It's
like Rush's music. There's nothing that doesn't fit into
travel writing."<p>

And no, he hasn't given up his addiction to reading, but now,
he says, "I find I want to re-read
every good book I ever read for enjoyment -- to see how it
was done."  <p>

He has no book writing plans for himself yet. The learning is 
satisfaction enough.  "It's like starting drumming over. At the beginning,
improvement and progression come so rapidly, whereas after
20-odd years of drumming, I've reached the point of such
small return that I know I'm <em>at</em> my potential.  Without false
humility or unworthy pride, I can say that I'm as good as I
can be.  <p>

"And that's a difficult thing to face."<p>

But as a friend recently wrote him, "Crisis is both danger
and opportunity."<p>

And fortunately, he doesn't feel he has stopped growing as a
musician, which is how he uses his peaking skills as a
drummer. "Your palette of colors may be full -- that's the
drumming part -- but how you apply those colors, of course,
that's the painting. And painting the arrangement together
with the other guys, that part has lost none of its shine."<p>

Geddy agrees. "Part of the reason that we are a trio," he
says, "is because when we were younger we wanted to be busy.
And strut our stuff. Not have to be subservient to another
instrument.<p>

"We were a technical band. We were musicians putting vehicles
together for our musicianship. I think our approach is very
different now. We're songwriters now, we're
craftsmen -- composers and orchestrators and arrangers."<p>

Geddy isn't looking to Neil just for attractive syllables to
mouth, he wants to be singing something he can stand behind.
"I have to feel comfortable with what he's saying."<p>

Rush defines itself by the choices it makes moment by moment,
song by song. "It's hard for us to see the big picture," says
Geddy. "We really don't know what we're going to do before we
do it."<p>

Some songs suit them all instantly. "Others need more
discussion, more exploration."<p>

After all, accepting a new lyric often means committing to
singing it hundreds times.<p>

Musically there is a shared sense of purpose. "As much as we
like to get heady or pseudointellectual," says Geddy, "the
reason we play in a band is because we like to play rock. We
like to play hard rock. I think that's the one thing you'd get the
three of us to agree on: we don't want to be wimpy.<p>

"So I guess whenever we feel like we're getting too mature,
something in us rebels and wants to kick some <strong>butt</strong>!"<p>

Sound like the formula for a perfect three-way marriage?<p>

"The analogy is tempting," says Neil, "but the difference is
that the nucleus of Rush is the work." Not the people.<p>

"And while the work is binding, we're outside of it. So that
takes a little pressure off the interpersonal part of it."<p>

For example, "If someone suggests a different direction,
you're at least willing to be open about it, because it
doesn't threaten you as a person."<p>

Geddy defines what they share as a sense of stability in the
worth of what they are doing together.<p>

"We're fortunate," says Neil, "that the essence of what we
want to do happens to be engendered by our being rock fans."<p>

They don't think they have a duty to the world. They do think
they have a responsibility to their fans. But that
responsibility does not include perpetuating themselves. Or leading 
anybody anywhere.<p>

Nonetheless, they have some of the most fervent post-teen
followers in the rock world. The previous live video showed
thousands of air drummers doing unison reproductions of Neil's
most complex foundation patterns and unison lip-sync on his
most complex lyrics.<p>

A particular challenge for Geddy was learning to relate to
the audience personally. "We're such a formal band -- so damn
structured. I've taken a more casual approach to talking to
an audience over the last couple of years."<p>

But it came hard. "I'm generally a quiet person
off-stage -- unless I'm with my closest friends and being at one
with 15,000 people made me uncomfortable. I didn't like the
Hitlerian schtick so many bands use, demanding that you Have
A Good Time. And I didn't have a lot to say."<p>

But he has learned to give people the impression that he is
being himself.<p>

Fully occupied behind his drum kit, Neil doesn't have that
problem, so he finds another: "the tendency to fall apart"
when recording live, knowing that "every little inaccuracy,
you don't just commit it into the ether of a live show, you
commit it onto the firm iron oxide of rolling tape" --  and onto
your inner consciousness, where it causes pain.<p>

But he feels it's important. A live album ends to "cement an
era" and gives the band time and encouragement for new
exploration. "It has always marked a change for us, though
not of conscious design." <p>

Geddy dreaded going from the album to mixing the video. <p>

"But you know? I really I enjoyed it. We were doing it to picture, and I never
get to see us.  There are effects and magical moments
I'd never known were happening." <p>

When he's on stage he has to think about the performance moment by moment. 
"For me the hardest thing to get right is to sing in key over the din of the
hall and the crowd and the PA. So I'm concentrating on the
monitors.  <p>

"You're also thinking about what you're playing on
bass, foot-pedal moves, what song is coming up next so you
can be in position to change switches to set up the next song
on cue...<p>

"At your peak you've got full peripheral awareness. You're
all lit up. The stage is pumping and you're connected to
everything going on. It's a high."<p>

Does this sound like a man who might throw it all over for
more art galleries and baseball games?<p>

He feels even more positively about studio recording.<p>

"Albums are really time-capsules for us. We go in with very little and work 
very intensely and come out with this finished thing. Who you are and what 
you're going through is very much a part of the record."<p>

They have to have faith that no matter how an album turns
out, it will prove one day to have been a necessary step on
their way to wherever they're going.<p>

"You experimented. You learned from it, and then let it go.
You move on. Letting go is the tough part. It's probably the
toughest part of life. But on you go."<p>

On to the next thing.<p>

Whatever that is.<p>
