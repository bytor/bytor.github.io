<font size=+1>Rushing back into the spotlight after an 18-month
hiatus, Rush is back with a new sound and new tour</font><br>
<b>by Alan Sculley</b><p>

Rush is far from the only group giving the 1997 summer concert
season a distinct 1970s rock accent. But unlike contemporaries
such as Styx, Supertramp or Boston -- all of which are back in
action after personnel changes or temporary breakups -- Rush is
one of the few bands of the era to have stayed intact and
continuously recorded and toured. <p>

This fact is not lost on drummer Neil Peart. <p>

"When we got together, did we ever think about 20 years down the
line? No way," he said emphatically. "In fact, on our first tour we
collected souvenirs and so on, thinking it might be the last. You
dare not take anything for granted. I think another contribution to
our longevity is that we've never taken ourselves for granted, and
we've never taken our career for granted or our fans or anything.
It's always been a fresh battle every time." <p>

The latest challenge for Rush was their recent CD, "Test For
Echo," the 16th studio record for the Canadian trio, which also
includes bassist/singer Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson. <p>

The new CD follows an 18-month hiatus -- the longest break the
band has ever taken from recording and touring. In that time Peart
worked on a tribute album to drummer Buddy Rich, Lifeson made
a solo record (as "Victor") and Lee became a father of a baby girl. <p>

And when the trio reconvened in October 1995 to begin work on a
new CD at Chalet Studio near Toronto, some subtle changes had
occurred to alter the way they worked together. <p>

Within Rush, Lee and Lifeson write the music, while Peart handles
the lyrics. But for "Test For Echo," Lifeson, fresh from the Victor
project, arrived ready to make a greater impact than ever before. <p>

"I think this time it was harder for them (Lee and Lifeson) to find a
new balance because Alex was coming back with a new level of
confidence and involvement and wanted to assert that," Peart said.
"They had to find a new dynamic between them than they'd had in
the past. So it is more difficult." <p>

Things apparently didn't always go smoothly. <p>

"Any time there's a truly collaborative piece of work where you
have to create on the spot in the same room together, I think that's
a difficult situation," Peart said. "So I kind of empathize with what
they have to go through with that, but it certainly works, and it's
fortunate that they've been friends so long that they can weather
nearly any kind of a difficult patch." <p>

The finished product suggests that Lee, Lifeson and Peart found a
workable balance. "Test For Echo" retains the complex,
progressive rock sound established with well-known songs like
"Tom Sawyer" or "The Spirit Of Radio," but it does have its
shades of difference -- particularly in scaling back keyboards to
emphasize more of a guitars/bass/drums sound. <p>

"On this record, I was certainly very focused on drum set playing,
but at the same time, I never closed the door on electronics," Peart
said. "I had my samplers and all the pads and stuff sitting there if
they were required. But the songs as they came about simply didn't
require that. So very often just the songs themselves dictate which
way to go." <p>
