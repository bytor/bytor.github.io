Directions</font>
<ul>
<STRONG>From San Francisco:</STRONG> 
Take US 101 south to the Shoreline Rd. East exit in Mountain View (after the 
San Antonio Rd. and Rengstorff Rd. exits). Go over 101 and follow Shoreline 
Rd. about one mile to the amplitheatre, which will be on the left.
<p>
<STRONG>From San Jose:</STRONG> 
Take US 101 north to the Shoreline Rd. exit (this is an odd exit, with Highway 
85 entering 101 here, and both Shoreline and Old Middlefield Rd. exits). Take 
the first right turn in the exit. At the stoplight, turn left onto Shoreline 
Rd. Follow Shoreline about one mile to the amplitheatre, which will be on the 
left.
<p>
<STRONG>Parking:</STRONG> 
Lot parking is available on-site for $6 per car. Spaces for handicapped 
parking are available in the front lot for $6 per car. Shoreline is surrounded 
by high-tech companies, who do not allow concert parking in their lots (if you 
happen to work for one of them, I believe you can park in your lot if you show 
ID). An alternative to parking in the lot is to park across 101 on one of the 
side streets and hike up Shoreline (it's not that bad a walk, and you'll have 
plenty of company).
</ul>

Music Stores in the Area</font>
<ul>
<STRONG>Tower Records:</STRONG> 
Corner of San Antonio Rd. and El Camino Real. <br>
<em>Every day 9 - midnight</em><br>
Your basic big record store. Has new CD's, tapes, minidiscs. Also sells blank 
audio/video tapes. Also sells videos & laserdiscs 
in the same store. Tower Books is right next store, as well.
<p>
<STRONG>CD Warehouse:</STRONG> In Sunnyvale on El Camino Real between Cezanne 
and Fair Oaks. Take El Camino south; as it curves to the left, it's on your 
right in a grey strip mall with apartments upstairs.<br>
Carries new and used CD's. Extensive used CD bins.

Places To Stay</font><p>
<font size=+2>
Places To Eat</font>
<ul>
If you like Asian food (of any nationality), you've got to check out Castro 
Street in Mountain View. Castro is the main street of Mt. View, and it has 
everything from Indian to Japanese to Indonesian within 3-4 blocks. A 
particular favorite: Yakko's Japanese restaurant, one block "north" of Castro 
on Dana, has great lunchtime bento boxes and lots of good stuff for dinner, 
too. Expect to pay $8-10 at lunch (inc. tax and tip), and $13-16 at dinner. 
There's also a pretty good Italian restaurant on Castro called Florentine (I 
know...Italy isn't part of Asia...so tell it to the diNapoli family!). The 
diNapolis also own a number of Florentine Pasta Shops (take home pasta and 
cook it, or eat from a limited menu), including one in the same strip mall as 
CD Warehouse (see above).

Other Things To Do</font><p>
<ul>
<STRONG>Shoreline Park</STRONG>, just beyond the amphitheatre on Shoreline 
Ave, is a park on the bay that's great for flying kites, running, skating, 
biking, etc. There's even a small lake where you can rent sailboards and 
canoes (and other small boats, too, I think).
<p>
<STRONG>Fry's Electronics</STRONG>, Sunnyvale. Lawrence Expressway and Kern Ave.<br>
If you'd like to see a bit of Silicon Valley, you should see Fry's Electronics 
in Sunnyvale. Fry's has everything from silicon chips to potato chips to small 
appliances. Each Fry's store has a different decoration scheme--Egyptian, Wild 
West, Aztec--and this one is designed to look like the inside of a computer. 
Note the green floor with gold paths running through it, the Enter and ESC 
buttons on the door, the giant resistors, the enormous magazine rack...this is 
nerd heaven. :)
