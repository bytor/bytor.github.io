Someone else has finally pressed a copy of the Oakland 1992 soundboard.
However, unlike most copies, this sounds better than the first "Rush 'N'
Roulette '92" CD. The sound is clearer, the vocals more up-front. This is
either a closer-to-master copy, or one that has been remastered.
It is NOT a copy of the RNR92 cd, as the cds break in different places.  <P>

This has all the same tracks, and is essentially the same recording as RNR92.
The medley, however, is a single track and not indexed individually as RNR92 
is. The booklet is also superior, containing several live concert shots (mostly 
from "Hold Your Fire") and a copy of the Rush Tour Dates Listing (found 
elsewhere on this web site) "Roll The Bones" section.<p>

It was obviously put together by someone who "cared", none of the tracks is
mislabelled (and yes, they actually put "The Spirit Of Radio" INSTEAD of
"Spirit of the Radio"!!).<p>

If you thought RNR92 sounded good, wait till you hear this one! A definite
MUST buy (you might want to get it even if you already have RNR92!). If you
have a choice between the two cd's, my vote would have to be with Mirrors.<p>

From the first listen I could tell that this boot was something else.  The 
bass and the intros' come in fine.  Alex's guitar is very upfront too.  Neil's 
drum solo is amazing!  The quality of this boot is of amazing quality.  This 
is truly something not worth tossing aside pick it up if you can.<br>

Mirrors overall is a GOOD cd. The sound of the guitar and drums are clear. 
Geddy's bass tracks are barely audible.  It is a struggle to hear them.  
Geddy's voice is not up to par at this show, eventhough it comes in clearly.  
What the hell!! During The Big Money and show dont tell, the low bass notes 
from the bass midi pedals causes the sound to break up a bit. It sounds 
terrible!! I guess the tape couldn't handle it.  The person mastering this cd 
obviously didnt know what Rush's sound should be like.<br>

If you didn't know it was a bootleg, you'd swear it was a legit. live album!
I definitely think it is the best live album out!
This is definitely a sound-board recording, and if you like
bass, be careful because this cd could blow your wolfers if
you're not careful.  It's just awsome.
If you only have room for one live album, this should be it!<br>

This is an awesome live album.  The extended version of Bravado is one of 
the most spectacular things I've ever heard.
This is a must for RUSH fans.<br>

By far one of the best Rush "boots" that you can get.
The overall quality of the sound is awesome (crank it and
it'll sound like you're *AT* the concert.) And it didn't hurt
that Rush played a great show that night. This CD is better
than it's Rush 'N' Roulette counterpart. RUN and buy this one
if you can find it.<br>

   I, like you said, thought it was a great sounding concert. I thought that 
it only had one problem though. A lot of the times through the songs I could 
hardly hear the bass guitar. I'm glad Geddy switched back to the Fender basses 
on their recent tours. I think they're a lot louder and they sound better 
than the Wal Basses that he used before. The guitar and drums come through 
clear as a bell. The packaging on mine must not be the same as yours because 
mine has no pictures or tour dates on the inside. All it has is the picture of 
Geddy on the front, and two separate pictures of Alex and Geddy on the back. 
And yes, the songs are all listed correctly and in the correct order.<br>

Great to own it!
The vocals are a little bit too much up front
and there's a couple of songs that have low hum
when the synthesizer plays bass parts.
I don't know the professional name for that
but it sounds like a tape that's recorded too loud.<br>

I have only seen Rush live once, so I thought I'd splurge on
this CD, and I wasn't disappointed.  I really enjoy this disc.
Rush is flawless throughout this show, the sound is excellent f
for a bootleg.  It almost sounds like it was released by the band
itself<br>

The best sounding Rush bootleg.  Rivals "A Show of Hands" in both song selection
and sound quality.<br>

This is a great CD.  As stated in the NMS review, it seems like this came off of
 the sound board.  Full range, deep bass....would have been nice to have this
kind of bottom end on "A Show of Hands". My only complaint, and the reason I 
didn't give it a perfect 10, was because it begins to distort on some tracks 
at the lower end.  The record was probably set, and left without adjustment, 
troughout the show.  Other than that, "Roll the Bones". Buy it.<br>

This is definately the best Rush boot out there. I desagree to the opinion that
"Animated" is the best one, though it is fantastic. "Mirrors" sound quality is 
very close to a regular live album. I truly believe it has been 
mixed/engeneered before being released.<br>

The best of the best. I first heard the medley while driving home from the 
show at JOnes Beach in the summer. When they gave the name of the CD I ran to 
my local record store and checked it out. It is absolutely tge best I have 
ever heard. But I do not hear anything from "Cygnus x-1" at hte end of the 
medley as the listing states.<br>
