  <font size=+2>O</font>ddly enough at the same time Peart pointed out he didn't have it in
for the New Wave which was an area which intrigued him. More than once
he'd gone into print saying that Johnny Rotten had been a performer of
enormous charisma and power with The Sex Pistols.<p>

  Said Geddy Lee, on the same subject as the album's title "As far as
I can see, new wave, old wave, yellow wave - it's all the same. The
water doesn't come and go. The waves do."<p>

  To sum up, the band's attitude to the press is perhaps given away on
a part of the album cover which shows a newspaper blowing in the wind.
The banner front page headline is a classic in the history of American
newspapers. It refers to the result of the 1948 Presidential election
  and the newspaper got the result wrong.<p>

  Still, if Rush didn't much like the British music press and the
attitudes of most of its members they couldn't deny that they got
plenty of coverage when their next British tour was announced.<p>
                          
  The band were revealed as having a month long touring schedule in
Britain for June, 1980. They opened at Southampton Gaumont (June 1 and
2), followed by five nights at London's Hammersmith Odeon (June 4 to
8), Glasgow Apollo (10 and 11), Newcastle City Hall (12 and 13), Leeds
Queens Hall (15), Chester Deeside Leisure Centre (16), Manchester
Apollo (17 and 18), Birmingham Odeon (20), Leicester De Montfort Hall
(21) and Brighton Centre (22).<p>
                          
  By the time the tour was announced ticket demand had already been
quite remarkable. Simply on speculative mail order bookings, or
information via word of mouth, Hammersmith Odeon had sold out for the
first two nights, both shows at Glasgow Apollo had already gone and
Newcastle City Hall reported that by the time their dates had been
announced they'd had enough postal bookings to fill the place anyway.<p>

  Meantime the band was finishing off their five month American tour
and considering what they were going to do for their next live album.<p>

   It's interesting that their original thought was that it was about
time for another live one - having enjoyed a lot of success with 'All
The World's A Stage' which had been released nearly four years
previously.<p>

  It could also have been that the band were feeling a little tired
both mentally and physically after the considerable effort they'd put
into making 'Permanent Waves' and then embarking on the subsequent,
hectic tour of North America.<p>

  However, as Neil Peart records towards the end of that tour
something changed their mind about the next album. "It had been our
announced intention to record and release a second live album but an
unlooked-for charge of ambition and enthusiasm caused a last minute
resolution to throw caution out of the window and dive headlong into
the making of a studio LP instead.<p>
  "The reasons for this are difficult to put to paper, being somewhat
instinctive, but all of us had been feeling very positive and our
Research and Development Dept (sound check jams) had been very
spirited and interesting, so it was felt that the creative hiatus
provided by a live album was not really necessary at present and it
would be more timely and more satisfying to embark on the adventure of
a new studio album".<p>

  By the time the band got to the UK, despite having decided not to
make a live album they found that the arrangements they'd made to
record their five nights at Hammersmith Odeon and the concerts at
Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle couldn't really be changed without
major hassles.<p>

  So they went ahead and recorded them anyway and the plan was that
these tapes could be added to recordings from the 1981 North American
tour - they plan ahead, these guys - and maybe a live album could be
extracted from that - a live album which would live up to the exacting
standards Rush set themselves.<p>

  <font size=+2>I</font> went to see the band twice at Hammersmith Odeon - it would have
been all five nights but I couldn't get the tickets - and on the first
one I felt just a bit concerned that they were perhaps going through
the motions. By the time I went to the second I realised they were
doing no such thing. Instead they were working harder at pacing their
set and trying to integrate the new material with the cataclysmic
older stuff. It turned out to be a good tour for Rush, all told - but
that was something they had still ahead of them when I went backstage
at the Odeon to talk to them.<p>

  Backstage seemed orderly but overpopulated. There was no particular
madness going on - just an awful lot more people than usual. I'd
requested an interview with Alex and I was hanging around outside the
dressing rooms while the road crew ushered in fans, six at a time and
as smartly lined up as a bunch of Coldstream Guards at the Trooping of
the Colour. The autographs were signed, the lucky six were wheeled
out, expertly and efficiently and the next half dozen were ushered
into the presence with equal precision. You had to admire the
way it was done really - no pushing, no crushing and everyone got
served.<p>
  
  It did mean hanging about for ages and when it finally came to
talking time I found myself face to face with Neil. Of course I
thought the interviews are done in strict rotation and I got Neil
again. No matter - they're all good talkers.<p>

  We found a deserted dressing room and within a few minutes of small
talk it was Peart who raised the hoary old topic of the NME interview
with Miles and the whole crypto-fascist smear. I was surprised really
because all of that was very much history.<p>

 "I look back on that and I still can't believe it" he said, shaking
his head. "We were just having a good conversation discussing our
political views and I was surprised at the way it came out in the
paper. I guess it doesn't really bother me anymore and I guess I'm
kind of tired talking about it. I mean I don't know what to say about
it - you say what you like about the whole thing, you know enough
about the band to get it right."<p>

  He perked up considerably when we talked about the band's ever
increasing success rate all over the world, and particularly in the
States where, I'd heard, radio stations were playing their stuff in
significant quantities for the first time ever.<p>

  "We're seeing the results of all the hard work we've put in over the
years" said Neil. "We've worked so hard at establishing ourselves in
Britain, for example, that when we come over here now we expect to
have a good tour. I don't want this to sound conceited in any way but
we expect sell-out concerts and we expect good responses from the
audience.<p>
  "We put in the work and now we're seeing the results. Of course if
we did a bad show I wouldn't expect a good response, but I'd be really
surprised if we did a bad show these days.<p>
  "In America I think a lot of the disc jockeys are being forced to
play our songs now because the kids are phoning them up and demanding
that they play them. For me that's ideal. I don't want a jock playing
our material because the record company promotion man is his best
friend, or his brother-in-law. I either want them to play it because
they're into it, or better still, play it because the kids want to hear
it.<p>
  "It's pleasant enough getting response from radio stations and from
the American press now but I can't say that we're all too excited
about it. It's okay but we're not about to start celebrating because
some jock has finally discovered who we are - they all had plenty of
chances over the last eight years, when we really needed them. Now,
it's nice to have them but I can't say that we really need them, now
when we have audiences like the one we had here at Hammersmith and
like so many of the crowds we're getting in America now.<p>
"You know, it's tremendously satisfying to do well in Britain. It's
not the most important market in the world in terms of record sales
but we all have a special relationship with this country. I've lived
here for a while, we've recorded several albums here and enjoyed doing
them tremendously and we've also experienced a lot of loyalty from the
fans. You really can't have a better relationship than that."<p>

  Neil was still keeping his options open concerning whether the next
Rush album would be live or studio.<p>

  "We're recording much of this tour" he said "and if it works well we
probably will do a live album. We've recorded shows before - apart
from the 'All The World's A Stage' recordings - but somehow it really
never went right.<p>
  "Speaking personally, wherever I got on stage I found myself being
terribly conscious of the show being recorded and, as a result made
some mistakes.<p>
  "But then I found that my mind was magnifying those mistakes to the
point where none of the concerts seemed satisfactory. But now a live
album seems a logical step and I think we're at an emotional and
mental stage in our careers where we can do one with confidence and
know that the end result will turn out to be good enough to please."<p>

  <font size=+2>A</font>fter their last show at Hammersmith the band were invited to a
reception in their honour given by Phonogram, their UK record company,
at the enormously swish Cafe Royal in Regent Street.<p>

  I popped down there as well and probably spent more time at the
party than the band. They listened patiently to speeches, collected
various silver discs, said a few polite words in return and then
commandeered a couple of tables for themselves, their crew and their
closest friends and basically insulated themselves from the rest of
the room.<p>

  Having completed the British tour to a tumultuous response the band
went back to Canada for a swift break and then trundled back into the
studios to kick ideas around for the next album.<p>
                          
  By now they had definitely decided that a live album was not on the
cards and were considering material for a studio one which they now
keenly wanted to do.<p>

  At the end of July they were in Toronto's Phase One studios with Max
Webster recording a song called 'Battlescar' for The Webster's next
album. Peart described the sound the two bands made at full tilt as a
"Wagnerian tumult". However, while they were in the studios, Pye
Dubois, The Webster band's Iyricist, presented Rush with a song of
his. This eventually turned into a track called 'Tom Sawyer' one of
the stand out cuts on the band's forthcoming album 'Moving Pictures'.<p>

  Following the pattern of work they'd established on 'Permanent
Waves' the band went off to a quiet place, Stony Lake in Ontario, to
rough out their musical and Iyrical ideas for the new album. 'The
Camera Eye' was the first to be composed, followed by 'Tom Sawyer',
'Red Barchetta', 'YYZ' and 'Limelight'.<p>

  'YYZ', incidentally, which I thought was something to do with
chromosomes and genetics when I first heard it, turned out to be
inspired by something far more mundane. It is, in fact, the
international identity code for Toronto Airport. "The intro" says Neil
"is taken from the Morse code which is sent out by the beacon there.
It's always a happy day when YYZ appears on our luggage tags".<p>

  By the end of August the band was back in Toronto's Phase One
studios with co-producer Terry Brown (alias Broon) where they put
together demos of the five songs already mentioned and also a version
of 'Witch Hunt' which turned out to win the Rush Award for the most
re-written song in their repertoire.<p>

  "Our intention" he said, explaining why they persisted with it, "had
always been to use it as the production number of the album, in the
tradition of such pieces as 'Different Strings', 'Madrigal' and
'Tears'. This frees us from our usual practice of writing as we would
play live, maintaining the discipline of a three piece band."<p>

  The band brought in keyboard player Hugh Symes and what they called
a "Vigilante Choir" in the show. Peart happily agrees that this
particular track was, and was always intended to be, "a small dose of
studio indulgence."<p>

  <font size=+2>T</font>he band took a break from recording in October and played a short
tour, mainly of the East Coast of the United States. During that time
they rehearsed the five finished songs as often as possible and
introduced 'Tom Sawyer' and 'Limelight' into the set.<p>

  From October to December the band worked on finishing the album.
They had to work hard at getting the finished versions of 'YYZ', 'Tom
Sawyer' and 'Limelight' but, to their surprise, 'Red Barchetta' turned
out right on the first take.<p>

  The last song to be done was 'Vital Signs'. The band had
deliberately left themselves short of one track before they went into
the studios having achieved such good results, writing in the studio,
with past works like 'Natural Science' and 'The Twilight Zone'. Neil
describes the inspiration for the song as "my response to the
terminology of 'Technospeak', the language of electronics and
computers, which often seems to parallel the human machine in the
functions and interrelationships they employ."<p>

  Obviously the machines felt that Neil was getting close to finding
something out about them because they rebelled at the mixing stage of
'Moving Pictures'. The digital mastering machine, the mixdown computer
and one of the multi-track machines packed in one after the other
driving the band and Terry Brown mildly insane and setting back the
recording schedule by two weeks. Peart records he was glad to get it
over with, "as with anything that drags on too long", but he expressed
himself more than pleased with the outcome.<p>

<font size=+2>I</font>t's chastening to think, and a fascinating illustration of the
standards of modern music, that a total of around six months work
ended up producing just 40 minutes of recorded music.<p>

  With a brief break for Christmas and the start of 1981 the band
embarked on a massive tour of North America in February to coincide
with the simultaneous worldwide release of 'Moving Pictures'. Without
going into too much detail, Rush's tour of America was their biggest
yet and, for them, it was probably topped by appearing at New York's
massive and prestigious Madison Square Garden - where only the very
biggest bands have ever appeared.<p>

  By the end of the tour they were rated as one of the Top Four
concert attractions in North America and were generally acknowledged
as the top working heavy metal band.<p>
                           
  They played their last date of that tour in July and then awarded
themselves the luxury of an extended break. They weren't back on the
road until October when they played a massive tour of the UK, not so
much in number of gigs but the sheer size of venues - playing multiple
dates in the biggest arenas Britain could offer, like Stafford Bingley
Hall and Wembley Arena.<p>
                           
  To coincide with that they finally got out their live album, 'Exit . . . 
Stage Left'. The band had done what they promised which was to
take recordings from the last British tour and combine them with tapes
from the North American tour.<p>
  Talking to Alex at Bingley Hall - I finally picked the right time on
the interviewing rota! - he told me that the live one was very much a
Terry Brown project.<p>

  "It was really his baby . . . we would just kind of drop in now and
again, make a few suggestions and wander out again.<p>
  "Of course there was a lot of thought put into the selection of
tracks. There were some things we didn't really want to hear again and
there were others that had already been included on 'All The World's A
Stage'. But finally I think we came up with something pretty
satisfying". That judgement was heartily endorsed by the British
public who ordered 40,000 copies of the album before it was released.<p>

  Talking to Alex and looking at the band on the tour I got the
impression that I was dealing with a group of people who had finally
achieved everything they had wanted when they first started out in a
small Ontario township all those years ago.<p>

  America, Britain, Japan, most of Europe - all the major markets in
the world had fallen to them and they were rated among the best and
most successful bands in the world by legions of fans.<p>
  They had achieved sufficient confidence in themselves to entrust the
completion of their live album to Terry Brown. Admittedly he's just
about the fourth member of the band but time was when I doubt if
they'd have even allowed their immediate family to take a hand in
their professional careers.<p>

  They were looking forward to taking more time off, cutting down
their touring schedule from ten months a year to maybe a more
manageable six.<p>

  And then there were the solo projects. Said Alex: "I have a 16 track
studio being completed downstairs in my house at the moment and when
it's ready I think I might have a try at some solo material".<p>

  Geddy and Neil are considering individual projects too. Neil is very
interested in writing at the moment - not song writing but doing
things for magazines, short stories and so on. And Geddy will probably
find himself doing production for other bands since he's very
interested in that field.<p>

  "As for the band, at the beginning of '82 I guess we'll take
ourselves somewhere up to the frozen north of Canada and settle down
to writing. I don't think we'll have more than the usual trouble in
getting enough material."<p>

  Since then the band, for Rush, have been relatively quiet.<p>

  The first half of '82 saw them writing, touring in America, checking
out new talent to sign to their own Anthem label, continuing on their
solo projects and considering how best to hit those parts of Europe
which have hitherto not fallen quite as conclusively as the rest under
the Rush sway.<p>

  As usual there have been rumours in the music press about them
playing major festivals here about massive tours, about upcoming
albums.<p>

  But Rush, as ever, take their time. They've worked too hard and too
long to hurry things now. Their standards are higher than ever, their
approach as honest as ever, their concern for fans as high as ever.<p>

  For me they're one of the best bands ever to come along in rock and
roll. They'll probably continue for years yet, as inventive as ever,
entering Phase Four, Five and Six of their careers with equal style
and consideration as the first three. As far as I'm concerned they can
carry on forever. Hope you agree.<p>
