Well, you can buy this crap<br>
It's cheap and it won't work when you want it.<br>
Smokeless Ashtrays and Pocket Fishermen galore<br>
We've got diamelles<br>
On cheap 14-karet pinky rings<br>
They'll turn your fingers green<br>
If you wear them too long.<p>

You tune in to watch the crap that we are selling<br>
When you buy stuff our bankbook keeps swelling<br>
What you really bought, well we're not telling.<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<p>

Why are we rich? Because you're dumb<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<br>
Why do you watch us? You have no life, so<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<p>

Crates of Ginsu knives<br>
Brought over with the Bamboo Steamers<br>
Imported from Taiwan, from a guy named Egg Fu Yung<br>
We got Slim Whitman tapes<br>
Of him doing songs from Guns n Roses<br>
And Boxcar Willie doing disco's greatest hits.<p>

You pay for all the cool stuff we keep on buying.<br>
We eat caviar while your food is frying<br>
We will laugh at you while you keep on crying.<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<p>

What do we love? The impulse buy<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<br>
Are we remorseful? Not on your life!<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<br>
Our favorite words? Charge it please.<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<br>
Why do you listen?<p>

Jack, relax.<br>
Just sit there with your snacks.<br>
Don't strain your backs or put on slacks<br>
Just sit ther and smoke cigarettes in packs.<br>
Face the facts.<br>
You brain is extremely lax.<br>
Add correct sales tax, you dig.<br>
Don't drive around<br>
Looking for that blonde-headed wig.<br>
No action or reaction<br>
Don't get put in traction<br>
Or you'll lose interaction<br>
With our superstar attraction<br>
Mr. Max<br>
You better run, phone boy.<br>
We got some jerk all the way from Nome, boy.<p>

What a spiel<br>
To sell a deal.<br>
When the phones are hot<br>
Buy our stock.<br>
Credit cards,<br>
Going into hock<br>
Bank is folding<br>
When the money's gone<br>
Don't go scolding<br>
Whether platinum or golden<br>
It's as good as gold<br>
That's cold.<br>
Fake diamond stones<br>
Machines to make real waffle cones<br>
So get out there and dial<br>
And jam the phones.<br>
Get busy.<p>

Jam the phones.<p>

Why are we here? To make cash<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<br>
Why does it happen? 'Cause you're stupid<br>
Jam the phones.  Jam the phones.<br>
REPEAT AD NAUSEUM<p>
