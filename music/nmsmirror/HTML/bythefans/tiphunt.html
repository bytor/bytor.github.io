by Patrick Taylor<br>
<em>May 27, 1997</em><p>

The night is black<br>
The cows, unmoved<br>
Beware the chips that smell<p>

The juveniles gather round<br>
Approaching them with stealth<p>

Creatures are snoring in the stillness of night<br>
Their faces are blissful and at rest<br>
Silent we turn toward the slumbering sights<br>
But Bossie moos out in distress<br>
Quiet, a corncob, calms her tonight<br>
Consciences barely suppressed<p>

Moo! Moo!<p>

With all our might<br>
We push and pry<br>
Awakening - be still<p>

Laughing, heave the Steer off side<br>
A stupid human thrill!<p>

They say they have stomachs too big for us<br>
(For) to chew and digest blades of grass<br>
They say there is methane escaping from<br>
All the volumes of gas they must pass<br>
And those who poke the bulls for fun<br>
Must rise and get out of there fast<p>

Quick we run<br>
Quick from danger<br>
Slowed by muddy pants<p>

In a sense, the cows we tipped<br>
Are merely<br>
Rites of man<p>
