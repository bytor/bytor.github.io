<strong>Q. Where do I find them?</strong>
<DT>A. The best place to try is a record convention and/or swap meet. Some places
will also do these over mail order, and some local record stores in your area
might carry them. Goldmine magazine has a listing of record stores, some of
which do carry boots. There is also a mail order list of stores on the syrinx
ftp/gopher site and on the Rush Mailserver. To get it via email, mail to:
<a href="mailto:rush-srv@yyz.com">rush-srv@yyz.com</a> and put as the subject:
<strong>cd.stores</strong><br><br>

<strong>Q. How much should I expect to pay?</strong>
<DT>A. Usually you can find single discs around $20-25, and doubles $40-50
(US dollars).<br><br>

<font size=+2>Some Hints and Tips for buying at record conventions</font><br><br>
1) BRING A CD PLAYER!!! This <strong>cannot</strong> be stressed enough. 
Most sellers will let you listen to the discs before buying, so check first 
to make sure it's what you want, and that it will play on a cd player.<p>

2) BUY IN BULK. Many sellers will give you a deal when you buy several discs
off of them. Bring in friends if you have to. (I've been able to get singles
for $18 a piece this way).<p>

3) BRING CASH. Most sellers will <strong>only</strong> take cash so make 
sure you bring enough for everything you want.<p>
