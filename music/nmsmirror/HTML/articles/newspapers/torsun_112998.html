<font size=+1>What's the Rush?</font><br>
<b>by Kieran Grant</b><p>

<em>
After 25 years together, the veteran
Canadian rockers take stock of their
careers</em><p>

   As Rush releases its latest album, Different
Stages, the band finds itself in a different, and
difficult, stage. <p>

Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart just
recapped 25 years together with the double live
CD, which has gone gold since hitting stores two
weeks ago. <p>

Next year will actually mark 30 years since
singer-bassist Lee and guitarist Lifeson hooked up
to play as teenagers. <p>

But, as Lee confides in a recent interview in the
downtown headquarters of Rush's own label,
Anthem, it's "an anniversary we're not really
celebrating." <p>

Rather, Lee's thoughts are with drummer-lyricist
Peart, 46, who suffered a double dose of tragedy
when his daughter was killed in a car accident a
year ago and his wife died of cancer last spring. <p>

It's a painful and personal topic that Lee hesitates
to discuss. <p>

Questions of another album and tour are moot,
though judging from a recent string of inquiries
we've received from Rush fans, there are concerns
for the band's future. <p>

"My concern is for Neil and that's it," says a cool
but sombre Lee. "My heart breaks for him in what
he's gone through, and I can safely speak for all of
us that we're all concerned for him as a friend, and
that's it. This is my friend, and he's hurting. We're
all hurting. To think about anything of a practical
nature is inappropriate. <p>

"There's been a lot of support (from fans), but the
most anyone can do for Neil is give him the time he
needs." <p>

A graceful dedication to the drummer's family inside
the Different Stages CD package captures Rush's
feelings best: "Suddenly ... you were gone ... from
all the lives you left your mark upon." <p>

As Peart recovers privately, the album goes a long
way in celebrating the remarkable interplay that
makes him, Lee and Lifeson famous. <p>

Lee compiled and co-produced the disc, honing
hundreds of hours of live recordings from 60 shows
on two tours into a cohesive document of a
latter-day Rush concert. <p>

A limited edition version includes a third disc,
recorded live at London's Hammersmith Odeon in
February, 1978. <p>

All told, the collection is a musical signpost -- a
way for Rush to take stock of a prolific career. <p>

"A live album represents a lot of opportunities," Lee
says. "It's an opportunity to record new music. It's
also a chance to re-evaluate, in the context of all of
our music, the old favourites. <p>

"It raises the question, 'If this was the last live album
I ever did, would this song be worthy of it?' You
learn a lot about your own writing. That's a real
benefit." <p>

Rush have no doubt learned more about themselves
than most bands. <p>

Different Stages comes as part of Rush's "weird
habit" of releasing a live disc every four albums. <p>

According to Lee, the tradition started by accident.
In 1981, the band narrowly decided to release the
studio album, Moving Pictures, before the live Exit
... Stage Left. The former record went on to spawn
the classic Tom Sawyer and sell four million copies
-- their biggest-ever hit up 'til then. The latter was
seen as a good-luck charm. <p>

"It was a pretty good decision, in retrospect," Lee
deadpans. <p>

Then again, the virtuoso bass player has a lot of
Rush experts to answer to when it comes to making
a record. <p>

Rush's vast following stretches back through many
stages: Their days as a cult band fusing complex
progressive rock with mystical lyrics, an era
captured neatly in the tight grooves of Stages'
Hammersmith Odeon set; their graduation to an
uncompromising and sophisticated trio capable of
great -- some would say surprising -- commercial
success and musical influence. <p>

"It's hard to put us in context with the rest of the
music world," says Lee. <p>

"We've always floated along on this separate kind
of slipstream. We were never really aware of how
weird we were. In our early days we were naive,
and in our later days maybe blindly impractical. <p>

"And thank goodness for that. It's been a key to
our sound that we can do these things under the
mantle of hard rock and make it still accessible and
viable." <p>

Lee says the best way to please the fans with an
album like Different Stages is not to try too hard. <p>

"If I ask 10 Rush fans what songs they want to
have in a set, I can almost guarantee there would
be 10 different lists. <p>

"I just compared my own wish list with a reality
list." <p>

The result features staples like Tom Sawyer, YYZ,
2112 and a rare improvisational run at Closer To
The Heart alongside tunes from later records, like
1996's Test For Echo. It works, but Lee knows he
stands to be second-guessed. <p>

Where is Subdivisions? New World Man? <p>

"There's no winning," he answers with a laugh. <p>

"Sometimes you just have to do what you want to
and let the chips fall where they may ..." <p>

And move on to a new stage. It's all part of the
work-in-progress that Rush continues to be. <p>

"This record is about what our personality as a
band has become, and all those various parts good
and bad," says Lee. "We're so tied to what we've
become as a band, and a family. And most of what
we have become we owe to touring 250 days a
year and being on a different stage every night." <p>

<b>THE RUSH FILE</b> <p>

<b>Then:</b> 1969 -- 15-year-olds Alex Zivojinovich,
aka Lifeson, and Gary Lee Weinrib, aka Geddy
Lee, form a band in Toronto with drummer John
Rutsey. <p>

Neil Peart replaces Rutsey and brings his
songwriting skills on board in time for Rush's 1974
self-titled debut. <p>

<b>Now:</b> When Lee belts out that "all this machinery
making modern music can still be open-hearted "
on The Spirit Of Radio, he still means it. "It's
relevant," he says of the 1980 anthem, which took
aim at the inherent lameness of commercial rock
radio. <p>

"Maybe even more so, because we live in a time
that is so encroached upon by corporate
psychology that there's almost nothing we come in
contact with that isn't tagged or sponsored by
something. The whole corporate battle is over, and
we lost. <p>

"Once in a while we have to question, 'What should
the spirit of radio be?' What is it there for other
than to pummel you with the same song once every
hour?"  <p>
