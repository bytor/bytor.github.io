It's leaner and it's meaner<br>
It no longer turns you green<br>
It has 11 herbs and spices and it's<br>
reelee keen<p>

It's no longer just a poison<br>
But you know, we've found a cure<br>
It cleans out your system<br>
And keeps your colon pure<p>

It'll be as popular as the old, old Spam<br>
And still won't affect most of your glands<p>

When fried it tastes as good as steaks<br>
You'll learn to eat it with ham and eggs<p>

It's old enough to be your mom<br>
But young enough to make you lose it<br>
It's strong enough to win a war<br>
But tasty enough to make you use it<br>
It's NEW IMPORVED SPAM<p>

It a lot more leaner<br>
Took the fat right out<br>
It's brighter, its lighter, and it's very, very, hard<p>

You'll eat it by the hour<br>
Fry it in a bowl<br>
You'll eat it up in prime-time<br>
and keep your bladder full<p>

Try to save a space for this new, new Spam<br>
Go ahead and microwave this new, new Spam<p>

There're vitamins in here today<br>
So who cares if the nutrition is lame<p>

It glows enough to be a light<br>
But safe enough -- just use it<br>
It's gross enough to make you hurl<br>
If you're dumb enough to abuse it<br>
It's NEW IMPROVED SPAM<p>

Come to get a piece of this new, new Spam<br>
You can use it in heat, just like the old, old, Spam<br>
It's NEW IMPROVED SPAM<br>
It's NEW IMPROVED SPAM!!!!<p>
