A Not-Entirely-True Menu from The Orbit Room Cafe</font></center><br>

<em>
This was floating about in alt.music.rush.  There was very little on
it, so I decided to add several 'items.'  Several people began to
attribute it to me and sent me requests for it.  Looks like I am the
official keeper of the 'Orbit Room Menu' now.<P>

For those of you not in the Know, The Orbit Room is a cafe belonging to
Alex Lifeson. If you do not know the names of their songs and some 
not-so-obscure references to some of their lyrics, you probably won't find 
this very funny.  But if you, enjoy!  Who knows, maybe some day, we can 
actually order this from somewhere!<P>

With apologies to Geddy, Alex, and Neil...<p>
