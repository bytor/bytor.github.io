<font size=+1>Intimate venue is a real Rush</font><br>

What a Rush!<p>

That would be bassist-keyboardist-vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson 
and drummer Neil Peart.<p>

The trio of musical virtuosos who make up the veteran Canadian band Rush gave 
800 people at the Pheonix on Wednesday night a scaled-down but powerful sneak 
preview of their current road show that's expected to pull into the Gardens 
in the spring.<p>

The group has been touring the U.S. since October, where they have sold 
500,000 copies of their latest album, Test for Echo. (It's almost reached 
platinum status in Canada).<p>

"Hello Canadians!" welcomed Lee after the band whipped through Dreamline and 
The Big Money. "It's lovely to see you here. How are you doing? It's nice to 
be in such intimate surroundings for a change. I can see each and every one of 
you." Rush normally trot out the large video screen and laser light show to 
enhance their extremely loud but dynamic prog-rock sound in a stadium setting.  
But Wednesday night's event was another "blind date" show, in which contest 
winners arrive to see "a big band at a small venue" supposedly without knowing 
whom they are going to see.<p>

Previous groups in Toronto have included Metallica and the Sex Pistols, but 
Molson Canadian's final promotion of the year is different in that the same 50 
people are travelling across the country to see three shows in a row. It began 
Monday night in St. John's, Nfld., with Sheryl Crow, and wraps up Dec. 29 in 
Vancouver.<p>

For their part, Rush often seemed more excited than the crowd to be performing 
in such a small space, decorating the stage with a life-size cutout of 
soon-to-be-ex Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson Lee.<p>

"This is kind of fun," said the sunglasses-wearing Lee, who jumped around like 
a kangaroo all night long. "Getting sweaty up here and all that stuff".  The 
black leather pants-clad Lifeson, meanwhile, played the clown, striking rock 
star poses, making goofy faces and occasionally meeting Lee at the front of 
the stage to play side-by-side.  The usually serious Peart cracked a smile at 
one point, but otherwise remained hunched over his enormous kit, wowing the 
audience every time he threw a drum stick high up into the air and caught it.<p>

The band's 19-song set included five new songs from Test for Echo, most notably 
their latest hit, Half The World.<p>

But the crowd seemed more interested in Rush classics Closer To The Heart, 
Subdivisions, The Spirit Of Radio and Tom Sawyer. (Hey, even I had a few high 
school flashbacks during Lee's high-pitched vocals.)<p>

This is a group who perform the musical equivalent of finishing each other's 
sentences with finesse.  They appear to have never been fresher.<p>
