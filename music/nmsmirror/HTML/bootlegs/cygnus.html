This is the most unusual bootleg I've ever seen. It claims to be a "promo"
album for a band called Cygnus, covering bands of the '70s. The songs all
listed on the back are indeed Rush songs, although they claim to be by such
great bands as Zebra, Exhibit A, and Hadrian. This was probably to get around
the U.S. copyrights, as this is the only boot I've ever seen released by a
company in the U.S.  Do NOT be fooled by the packaging, this is a Rush 
bootleg!<p>

The show is from a Tucson soundboard recording, although this CD sounds
several generations away from the master. Overall the sound is excellent; each
instrument stands out, but sounds almost like the recording level was set too
high. A neat "bonus" is Geddy telling the crowd to "get back or the stage will
collapse, and it would be a bummer".<p>

The song selection on this CD is great! The fade from By-Tor to Xanadu is
amazing, and it does contain most of both books of Cygnus. I say most, because
somewhere in "Hemispheres" it fades out, then in again at a later part in the
song. My guess is the tape ran out at this point.<p>

Since this is supposed to be a band called "Cygnus", the packaging reflects
that. It tells a little about the band, who's in it (apparently they have four
members), and various copyright jargon. It has nothing to do with Rush except
the song listing on the back cover -- which is correct, amazingly enough.<p>

Overall, an excellent addition to a collection. Finding the cd itself might be
a little difficult, it was originally offered for sale across the
alt.music.rush newsgroup, and is limited to the person who originally 
offered it.
However, you can also find this show on tape (perhaps even with better sound
quality) from various traders. If you can find it, grab it!<p>
