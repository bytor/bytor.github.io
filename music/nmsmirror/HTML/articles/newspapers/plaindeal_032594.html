<font size=+1>OPENING PRIMUS OUTSHINES PRETENTIOUS RUSH</font><br>
<b>by Michael Norman</b><p>

I have had my share of horrible evenings as a music writer.  Two Billy
Ray Cyrus concerts come immediately to mind.  Then there were nights
spent with the likes of Michael Bolton, Kenny Rogers and a band called
Prong.<p>

But I have never experienced anything quite as excruciating as the Rush
concert Wednesday night at the Coliseum.<p>

Going to a Rush show is sort of like joining Mr. Peabody for a bad trip
in the Wabac Machine.<p>

You start the evening thinking it's 1994.  The opening act, Primus,
headlined last year's Lollapalooza festival, and their quirky tunes
are the ultimate in up-to-date cool.<p>

Then, Rush detonates one of its stage bombs.  And Presto!  Your're
thrown back in time to the age of pet rocks, head shops and bell-
bottomed jeans.  Jimmy Carter's president again, but that's not the
worst of it.  Arena Rock is back, too, in all its Wayne's World glory.<p>

For two hours, you sit there watching in disbelief as three 40-year-old
men - vocalist-bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer
Neil Peart - put on a pretentious, embarassingly juvenile, rock 'n' roll
show, complete with fireworks, flame machines and a 15-minute drum solo.<p>

Bloated seems almost too tame an adjective to describe the spectacle.
Making matters worse, you've heard most of the songs a thousand times
before because the idiots who program your town's radio stations play
them all the time.  "Tom Sawyer."  "Limelight."  "Spirit of Radio."
"Closer to the Heart."  And so on, ad nauseum.<p>

There are a couple of new tunes from the latest Rush release,
"Counterparts," the 19th album of the band's 20-year recording career.
But the lyrics that seem profound to the drunk sitting next to you
strike your sober mind as sophomoric and stupid.<p>

Ditto the music, which, for the most part, seems slick, bombastic and
soulless.  Lee's nasal monotone is as annoying as ever.  The same
goes for Lifeson's unimaginative, ride-the-scales riffing.<p>

Just when you think it can't get any worse, a giant, inflatable white
rabbit rises from underneath the stage and is "slain" by another giant
white rabbit holding a shotgun.  This is supposed to be art.  Rush,
after all, was one of the original "art-rock" bands of the 1970s.  But
it strikes you as just plain dumb, as do the artsy video clips the band
uses as backdrops.<p>

But, hey, the evening wasn't a total washout.  Heck, it was worth the
$23 price of admission just to see the slack-jawed look on those older
Rush fans' faces when Primus hit the stage for its all-too-brief
45-minute, seven-songe set.<p>

The San Francisco trio gets called a funk-rock band a lot, primarily
because people associate upfront bass guitar with the funk genre.  Lead
vocalist Les Claypool's unconventional bass playing certainly is the
band's lightning rod, but the Primus experience has more to do with
Rod Serling's "Twilight Zone" than Sly Stone's "Thank You (Falettinme
Be Mice Elf Agin).<p>

Over the past years, Claypool and his Primus pals guitarist Larry "Ler"
Lalonde and drummer Tim "Herb" Alexander have established themselves
as the Salvadore Dalis of hard rock, pumping out surreal lyrics and
oddball musical statements in albums with titles such as "Frizzle Fry," 
"Sailing the Seas of Cheese" and "Pork Soda."  Factor in Claypool's hillbilly 
vocal style and images of Hank Williams dropping acid at a rock show come 
to mind.<p>

Hmm, now there's a thought.
