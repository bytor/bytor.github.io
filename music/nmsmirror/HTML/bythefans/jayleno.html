by Doug Taylor<br>
<em>July 12, 1997</em><p>

Out of chat show kings<br>
There must only be one<br>
In his moments of glory<br>
The funniest things he has done<br>
If the show is on --<br>
No other channels are watched<br>
We will pay the price<br>
But we will not count the cost<p>

When Iron Jay appears<br>
And agony denied<br>
A work out too easy<br>
Exercises been tried<br>
If we take his side --<br>
Though seriousness is lost<br>
We will pay the price<br>
But we will not count the cost<p>

And if Kevs music stops<br>
Theres always the chat between guests<br>
All the talk and memories<br>
All the statements made in jest<br>
And if humour remains<br>
Though other shows are lost<br>
We will pay the price<br>
But we will not count the cost<p>
