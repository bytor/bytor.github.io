<strong><font size=+2>RUSH REDEFINED</font></strong><p>
By Andy Widders-Ellis<p>

   You can tell from the banter that the guys are feeling good: "PRS, that's
a guitar?" "No Ged, women have that." "Oh, I thought it was the Penis Reduction
System you use." "Well, Ged, I tried it, but it didn't work."<p>

   As we cluster around a table in the managements's Toronto office, I can't
help but notice how relaxd and downright healthy the two bandmates look. Is
obvious that Alex - tan and buff in a yellow muscle shirt - has been working
out. Geddy, his hair cascding below his shoulders, is looking tres cool and
collected in a pair of Lennon shades. Despite having already endured several
hours of local media interviews, the musicians seem mellow and eager to talk.
They've just completed their new album, Roll the Bones, and the experience is
fresh on their minds.<p>

   Even offstage, the guitarist and bassist work together, bouncing ideas back
and forth and often completing each other's thoughts. Above all, they don't
take themselves too seriously. Wow - still frisky after all these years...<p>

<font size=+1><strong>New Grooves, New Sounds</strong><p></font>

<dl>
<strong>GP :</strong> Roll the Bones hits me a lot lower than most of your previous records.
<dd>
<strong><strong>Geddy : </strong></strong>Gut level?</dd></dl>

<dl><strong><strong>GP : </strong></strong>Precisely.
<dd>
<strong><strong>Geddy : </strong></strong>Oh, I like that. That's a positive reaction.</dd></dl>

<dl>
<strong><strong>GP : </strong></strong>What did you do differently to punch the music down?
<dd>
<strong><strong>Alex : </strong></strong>We planned the direction before we started writing. We wanted to
bring the guitar up a bit more, compared to previous albums.<p>

<strong><strong>Geddy : </strong></strong>It's a combination of things: Number one is how we write these days.
This began with Presto, our last record. Alex and I start the songs together
-- just guitar, bass and vocals -- the way we used to long ago. It's a more 
organic
approach. And Rupert [Hine, Presto and Roll the Bones producer] helped us get
a lightly looser feel. Also, on this record I made a conscious decision to 
depart from my normal tone. I play with a little less top end and more bottom. 
I think all these things contribute to your response.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<strong><strong>GP : </strong></strong>What cause you to change your bass tone?
<dd>
<strong><strong>Geddy : </strong></strong>I got a new Wal bass, a red one. When I ordered it, I didn't expect
it to sound any different than my black one. The difference is fairly subtle,
but it is warmer. This may be because it has a slightly bigger horn. It's a
hornier bass... it's a red, horny bass.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<strong>GP : </strong>Hmm. Now that you mention it...
<dd>
<strong>Geddy : </strong>Deeper. [To Alex] There's an undertone to this 
interview. It started
with the intestinal thing. Now we're into biology?
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<strong>GP : </strong>Are the tempos a bit slower? The backbeats seem more 
pronounced.
<dd>
<strong>Alex : </strong>My son pointed out the same thing: There are no 
fast songs on this record.<p>
<strong>Geddy : </strong>It is more mid-tempo. That's intentional.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<strong>GP : </strong>Are the keys any different? Your vocals seem a bit lower.
<dd>
<strong>Geddy : </strong>I think most of the songs are in A or E. Slightly 
lower on the neck from a bass perspective.<p>
<strong>Alex : </strong>It's funny, we sort of lock ourselves into a 
particular key for an album. Each record is a little different.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>On songs like "Bravado" and "Dreamline" you get a pretty tough, chunky
sound when you settle into those eighth-notes grooves, Geddy. Are you using a
pick?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>I always use my fingers, but sometimes I grow my nails. Primarily
this one [shows right-hand middle finger]. As a child, I was fortunate to have
it almost chopped off.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Whoa!
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>When the nail grew back. it was extraordinarily 
tough. It doesn't break if I use it as a pick.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>The guitars sound more transparent - lots of bright, sparkling parts
with only an occasional fat solo. The audio spread's wider.
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>That's right. Again, deciding to move the bass down a little closer
to the bass drum range actually freed up some space. I usually play with a lot
of midrange twank. With that gone, or decreased, ther's more room for guitar.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Downplaying the keyboards also opens up space for the guitars and
vocals.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Stephen Tayler, our engineer, has a great ear for 
slotting frequencies. Everything has its area. He hears if a keyboard is 
going to mask something. Now we realize something that we didn't a few records 
ago: Just 'cause
you can overdub a thousand great ideas doesn't mean you should. It's a question
of developing taste and having the confidence to say, "If these ideas are
clouding up the fundamental parts, pull 'em out. Let's just keep the ones that
serve the song best." There will be plenty of room in another song for an idea.
And there's always another idea, so don't worry about it.
</dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>They're not precious.
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Yeah... that "not precious" philosophy really helps.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>When does this weeding out ocurs?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>We make a lot of decisions in ...<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>The writing stage.<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>The guitar parts are far more developed in the writing stage than
they used to be when there were lots of keyboards.<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>To be fair to me [laughs], with a couple of those 
records -- Power Windows and Hold Your Fire, for example -- the keyboards went 
on before
the guitars. They were just piled on there, and it was very difficult to weave
guitar parts around them.<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>In response, to be fair to the keyboards [more laughter], Alex
didn't have his parts together at that stage. Now when we write a song, his
parts are very defined. It's like, "We don't need to put a bunch of stuff here
because the guitars have priority." The keyboards take a textural role, whereas
before there was kind of ambiguity as who wold take the lead. That's where the
guitar suffered.
</dd></dl>

<font size=+1><strong>Songwriting Summer Camp</strong></font><p>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Where do you write?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>In a studio outside Toronto - kind of a farm. It's a great location
because we can go home on the weekends.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>You live there? Like going to camp?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>During the week. We stayed there about two-and-a-half months.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Everyone's up around 9:00, 9:30. Breakfast, watch the war for a bit.
About elevenish...
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>We get to work. At least I'd start. Alex would have to finish lifting
weights. I'd get half the stuff written before he came in [laughs]. We write
on and off all day, break for dinner, and go back in the evening. Usually that's
when Neil gets involved. He'll offer opinions on what we've done during the day.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>As band lyricist, does he write lyrics in response to the tracks you've
recorded or does he already have them in the can?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Both. We often write with finished lyrics in front of us. I prefer
that when I'm writing vocal melodies, because there's a certain feeling to a
lyric that you try to emulate  musically. Sometimes Alex and I  are dying to
write in a particular style. If Neil likes what we've come up with, he'll take
a tape and write lyrics to suit that.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Lyrically, if things don't feel right, Ged will change the order of
bridges or choruses. There's a lot of movement in the lyrics.
<p> 
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Alex and I act as editor for Neil, and he edits us. We produce each
other at this stage. I'm really happy at how well this process has worked for
the last couple of records. There are very few changes between the demo and
the reocrd. This time, in fact, so little chaged in the fundamental arrangements
that we were able to use our demos as guide tracks for the final recordings.
We'd jus transfer them to 24-track and redo each part as we went along. Having
our egos properly in place -being able to take criticism from each other and not
view it as an attack -- results from our long-term relationship. Alex and I have
a lot of fun during pre-production -- it's a special time. We get off on 
experimenting, writing, and arguing. You know, all those things that make a 
great partnership.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>We don't argue nearly as much as we used to.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>No? I don't agree.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Describe the writing process.
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>We start by jamming -just the two of us- with a cassette running.
When we hit a great little moment, it's on tape. The first stages are very
spontaneous. It's exciting: A vocal will pop out while we're jamming and it
[snaps fingers] suddenly leads to something else. The next thing you know,
you've got this momentum, and the whole song comes together in what seems like
a short period of time.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>You then make a demo?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Right. I've got a Tascam 388, an integrated mixer and
8-track reel-to-reel...
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>That's synced to my sequencer.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>All the keyboards and MIDI stuff run off SMPTE. That leaves seven
tracks for guitar, bass and vocals.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>I assemble the arrangements with basic drum pattern on my computer.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>While Alex is lifting weights?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Actually, when he finishes lifting, he comes in for 10 minutes and
then has to go watch his soap operas while I'm pulling my hair out with the
assembling.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>He's going, "Shit, stupid computer."
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Once we get a basic melody, we start adding instruments. We spend a
lot of time working on the arrangement, trying to make it more interesting and
achieve some progression.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>What computer and sequencing software are you using?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>For Roll the Bones, I used C-Lab Notator software. It came with an
Atari computer. Previously, I was using [Mark of the Unicorn's] Performer and
a Mac. I like the Notator software better, but I prefer to work on a Mac. The
Atari is a real pain in the ass.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>They've updated Performer; it's great now.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Soon Performer will offer direct-to-hard-disk digital audio recording
as well as MIDI sequencing.
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>That's definitely the direction we're headed in. 
Our next writing sesion will be digital.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Yeah, I've already got the computer upgraded.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>What guitars do you take to camp?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I primarily use a Tele.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>But he brings about 18 guitars.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Yeah. I love recording with my PR, but the active pickups require
batteries, so I can't leave it plugged in when I'm not around. The Tele is a
comfortable guitar to play all day long.
</dd></dl>

<font size=+1><strong>Roll The Tape</font></strong><p>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Okay. At camp, you produce a complete demo for each song. What happens
when you go into the studio to cut the real thing?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>We transfer the 8-track demo to 24-track. This give Neil a guide
version of the song. He plays to a click track while listening to the other
instruments. He rehearses so well befor he goes in that he knows exactly what
he's gonna play. On this album, nine times out of ten it took only one pass for
him to nail it.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>The drums sound phenomenal.
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Neil's parts are complex, too. Listen to the end of "Bravado".
There's an example of limb independence that rivals any drummer, anywhere. The
fact that he nailed taht in one take blows my mind. In only four days, Neil and
I had all the drums and bass parts down. When you record that quickly, you
wonder if maybe some ugliness will rear its head two weeks down the road. There
were only a couple of little moments that sounded a tad unsteady over all that
workd; we're able to live without them. Alex did almost all the guitars in about
eight days.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>In the past, it took three to five weeks.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>When do the bass and guitars go down?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>After Neil has done a few songs, Ged goes in to give him a break. Ged
does some basses, then Neil goes back in. As Ged said, the guide tracks are on
there, so there are vocal and keyboards when I go in.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>[To Alex] To a large degree your parts are worked out, because you've
done all that pre-production and rehersal. Whith the exception of some 
subtleties, the parts are cemented in your head. It's just a matter of getting 
a good
performance. You have confidence in you part, you've lived with it. Now when you
record, you're just looking for a groove. That really helped this time. Speaking
as a bass player, having a solid drum track  to play over and having confidence
in my parts made all the difference. I could just lock in.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>When did you works out you guitar parts?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I would take a stereo 1/4" mix of the final 
drum and bass tracks --plus the guide keyboards and stuff -- and bounce it 
to my 8-track. This would
leave me six tracks to experiment with ideas and sounds. With Neil and Ged
knocking off four tracks a day, I really had to cram. I'd works till 1:00 in
the morning, building things up, double- and triple-tracking. I'd work out some
solo things, too.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Did others get involved?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I'd play my demo for Rupert. Ged is always in the control room as well,
so we all know what the guitar is gonna do and can approach the final recording
logically.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>How do you determine wich guitar parts to put down first?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I usually put the strongest part down first -- anything that provides
basic reinforcing power. I'll do the more articulated sounds afterwards, usually
with the single-coil PRS or maybe the Tele.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Your acoustic and electric guitars are very integrated. On some songs
it's hard to tell where one starts and the other leaves off.
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Those active single-coil pickups produce such a clear electric sound.
They almost sound acoustic, like an Ovation that's miked rather than plugged in.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Yeah, I like that light electric sound a lot.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>My goal is to create one big guitar sound. To achieve that, I often
double-track the same phrase with a slightly different sound or different
instrument.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>The opening guitar riff in "Ghost of a Chance" is very twangy -- almost
rockabilly.
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Yeah, the spy part.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I used my PRS for that.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>I think you strengthened the riffs. Originaly it was a straight
double-track. You went back and put on a third, slightly heavier track.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>I hear a whiff of funk in "Roll the Bones" and " Where's My Thing".
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I've never been an accomplished funk player; I've never felt it. I
tried a little bit on Presto. I wanted to get better at it, so I took a chance
with this record.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>What amps did you recod with?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>For probably 80% of my parts, I used a Gellien-Krueger setup. I also
used a couple of Marshall 100-watt 2x12 combos, and a Marshall 100-watt 4x12
half-stack.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>You've used GK for a long time.
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Six years now.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>People into tube mythology claim you can't get 
righteous tone from solid-state gear such as GK. Do you buy this?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Solid-state has come so far from when it was first introduced in the
late 60's. Some people are purists, but it doesn't matter to me. The sound is
what counts. Tube or transistor, who cares?
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>There are two definite schools. In America there's a real tendency
to hold the natural approach -tube amps with minimal processing- in very high
esteem. Conversely, the English seem quite ready to grab gobs of EQ. They don't
care what you do, as long as you get the sound. We're more aligne with the
second school.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>A lot of people feel the same way about guitars. "Oh, my '52 blah blah
blah is the only guitar I can play 'cause it's got the greatest sound." I've
heard a lot of crappy old guitars [makes farty mouth noises], and I've played
some new guitars that are just brilliant - absolutely quiet. I own some older
instruments that I cherish, but when it comes down to playing, I much prefer my
PRS guitars.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Are those Marshalls tube or solid-state?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Tube. I used the combos about 10 years ago on a couple of tours. The
half-stack is a rental. We were going for a big, loud Marshall sound; the older
the amp and cabinet, the more fun it is.
</dd></dl>

<font size=+1><strong>
The Magic Of The Moment
</font></strong><p>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Do you assemble compsite solos from various takes?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>The solos in "Ghost of a Chance", "Bravado" and "Roll the Bones" are
basically one- or two-take solos played all the way trough. When we're deve-
loping the arrangement in the writing stages, I toss a solo on tape so we have
something to listen to. It's late at night, the lights are down low, and I'm by
myself. These were supposed to be throwaway solos, but when it was time to do
the "real" solos, Neil had already adjusted his parts to fit what I'd played.
So it came down to me trying to recreate everything - which doesn't work. You
might improve the sound, but even if you play exactly the same notes you'll
never capture that magic feel. The solos in "Ghost of a Chance" and "Bravado"
are certainly my favorites on the record, if not among my favorite solos ever.
When I listen to them, I heart the way I felt at that time. That's really the
key.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>"Bravado" sounds very spontaneous.
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I think it was a first take. I played my Tele through the GK preamp
direct to tape. The solo has a particular character and personality that's
uncommon for me. If I'd erased that and gone with something else, then it would
have been just another solo I put together in the studio, rather than something
that happened at a special moment.
</dd></dl>

<font size=+1><strong>
The Lifeson Sound
</font></strong><p>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>What's the secret to getting a big guitar sound in a tree-piece group?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I've tried to develop a style that combines broad arpeggios and
suspended chords. They've been my two main target areas. Suspensions have been
my little trick for many, many years.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Are effects critical to your sound?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I've always been interested in outboard gear, and I've tried to ve on
the leading edge of whatever is new. When chorus became available, I was the
first on my block to have one. I overdid it, I thingk, for a lot of years. It
wasn't until fairly recently that I got into pure guitar tone again. I didn't
find it very appealing for some reason. Now I love the power of straight sound.
You know, a little pull on the neck here and there when you're double-tracking
gives you a slightly shimmering, random sort of chorus that I find more
appealing than a constant whoosh.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Is that why you like bolt-ons -- because the necks are easier to yank?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I just think a bolt-on sounds better. The sustain works differently,
the low end is different. I've tried a couple of straight-through necks, but
they
didn't sound particularly good of feel comfortable. Again, it's what you're used
to. I'm sure if I was forced at gunpoint to use those guitars, I would grow to
like them.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>In the early days you played semi-hollow ES-series Gibsons: a 335, 345,
and 355.
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Yeah, all three. It was different sound, and I liked the idea of using
a hollow-body when everyone was using Les Pauls or Strats. There were problems
with the bodies resonating like crazy. We filled them up with cotton and did all
sorts of things to keep the feedback down. I really enjoyed playing those
guitars during that period, but I found I wanted to get a little more clarity
without going to a complete Fender setup. That's when I stuck a couple of
humbuckers on a Strat. Though it felt alien, the guitar sounded really good: It
had the warmth of my Gibsons with a Strat top end. Plus I still had a Strat
pickup in the middle for any arpegios or clean stuff.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Was that when you started to integrate the whammy bar into your playing?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Actually, I had a vibrato arm on the 355. It was effective, but it
would not stay in tune. I started using it around A Farewell To Kings, but it
was son unreliable I was afraid of it. The Floyd Rose came out around the same
time I got that Strat happening, so I put one of those on.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>But you weren't locking your nut.
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Right. On the modified Strats, I'd occasionally put 
some graphite or
WD-40 in the nut; that was enough. If a string went out of tune, I'd just give
it a little pull. I wasn't locking nuts until I started using Signature guitars.
Locking nuts are such a headache. It always bugged me to feel all that metal
down there when I was playing in a lower position. Visually, it bothered me too.
Now that I'm playing PRS guitars there's no need for that anymore. The strings
go straight up the headstock; they stay in tune just fine, though I don't dive
bombing or anything.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>On the new album you do some chunky muting along with Geddy's bass. Do
you find the PRS bridge more accommodating than a Floyd for this?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Yeah. I have the tailpiece set up flat. You don't have all that
fine-tuning hardware, so it is a lot easier to get your hand down. Also, I can
manipulate the whole tailpiece with my palm to get a little vibrato. On my
Signatures there was a lot more floating action in the tailpiece. They were
very funny guitars to set up, and I was never really happy. They required
continual alignment and maintenance, something I don't need to worry about with
the PRS guitars.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>So you're using a combination of finger vibrato, whammy bar, palm/bridge
manipulation, and neck pulling. Whew.
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I only move the neck around in the studio, unless I'm playing with a
fairly long delay. You need to be working against a straight version of what
you're playing. If you play a chord with a long echo and then move the neck
around, you'll get that random shifting. In the studio it's easy to do when
you're overdubbing.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Despite all this pitch shifting, your intonation is always dead accurate.
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>It drives me crazy when something is out of tune -- it's like a curse.
Unfortunately, I don't hear my vocals the same way [laughs]. But I can really
hear the instruments. In the studio Ged is always asking, "Is this perfectly
in tune here?"
<p>
   Occasionally we do things that are slightly out just to give a particular
character to the music. On "Heresy" [Bones] I'm playing my acoustics in the
chorus -- especially the second chorus -- to get a 12-string, Byrds kind of 
sound.
We wanted to create the effect of a buch of guys sitting around playing who
aren't quite in tune. You can hear it in the acoustic -- particularly the
[Gibson] J-55, whick has a Nashville tuning. Of course you're gonna get that
kind of fluctuation anyway when you're playing high up the neck, because the
strings are so light.
</dd></dl> 

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Do you have perfect pitch, or are you simply very discriminating?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Discriminating. When you zero in on the frequencies and how they move,
it's easy to tell when something's not in tune.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Do you add effects to your guitar during remix, or do you print them to
tape when tracking?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I much prefer to print to tape. On "Scars" [Presto], for instance, I
got free rein on all atmospheric guitar stuff. Some producers we worked with
in the past would have said, "No, let's print your guitar perfectly clean and
experiment later," but it's never the same. I say do it and live with it.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>In "You Bet Your Life" the delay is synced to the tempo. Did you or the
engineer do that?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I did it originally, then Stephen added a little bit more DDL to one
of the other cleaner guitars to give it more energy. The song seemed quite samey
as we went through different sections -- something was lacking. We wanted to get
the first verse seesawing a little more. Edge, from U2, is a pro at that.
</dd></dl>

<font size=+1><strong>
Rush In Concert
</font></strong><p>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Do you play loud onstage?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Neil is probably the loudest.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I gauge my volume so I can hear myself slightly over the drums.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>I don't play very loud -- just enough to feel it. Alex doesn't think
he plays very loud, but when I walk in front of his amps it's like somebody took
a hammer and whacked me on the side of the head.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Well, the top ends move out, so you're just hearing the highs as they
sail by. I tend to stand midstage, so I get a much broader sound spectrum.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>I would guess that our onstage level is significantly lower than most
hard rock or heavy metal bands. It's pretty much in control. We use a lot of
sidefill monitors to feed us different things; I don't think we could be very
subtle with those if our level was much higher. We've toned down a little 
onstage over the years.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>To protect you hearing?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Our stage level went down at the request of our house mixer. It has
relly helped control the upfront sound.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Are you concerned about hearing loss?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>[Yells] What?!
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>I have experienced some loss. My doctor tells me that my hearing is
perfect except for a little dip around 4kHz. I blame that on a particular
monitor guy I had for acouple of years. One too many feedback bursts.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>It's no Pete Townshend thing, that's for sure.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>I know a lot of musicians who have been playing for 20 years or more,
and their hearing is fine.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>The band's sound seems to have clarified over the years.
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>P.A. systems have come a long way. On the last 
tour, we had a spectacular house mixer, Robert Scovill. It was his idea to 
do the "Doghouses",
these big lead-lined plywood isolation boxes that we keep offstage. Each one
contains a 2x12 cabinet and a mike. It makes the guitar sound so clear -- no
leakage from the bass and drums. My on-stage cabinets are simply monitors; I
don't mike them.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>[To Alex] Psst - we're probably giving away a major trade secret.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Uh... but they don't work. They were in a fire. Remember? And then the
lava from the volcano...
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Swept them into the river. Terrible, you should never use one.
Bad idea.

Aural Gratification
</strong></font><p>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>What do you listen to for enjoyment?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Alex likes Zamfir a lot.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I get most of my influences from Zamfir [starts whistling]. I think
Eric Johnson's "Ah Via Musicom" is a great record. Normally I'm not to big on
solo guitar records. They're showcases for someone's playing ability -- 
interesting to hear once or twice. But I really love Eric's style and 
songwriting.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>I listen to a lot of things -- Billie Holiday, 
Louis Armstrong, even old country music -- that have little to do with what I 
play. I don't analyze the
snare or guitar sounds, I just enjoy the singing and songwriting. In terms of
contemporary bands, I listen to the Cure, Simple Minds, and I'm really into
Talk Talk's remix CD -- what a good compilation. I listen to Metallica from time
to time, just to crank it up. A lot of ethnic music, too, stuff on Peter
Gabriel's label [Real World]. I put the discs on and let it soak in. I recently
got a compilation of Haitian music assemble by [film director] Jonathan Demme
[Konbit! Burning Rhythms of Haiti, A&M]. That's a great, great record.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>When you're not recording or touring, do you practice instruments or
harmony?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>At home I play for diversion. I'll tinkle on the keyboards. Every
once in a while I'll find a sound that really inspires me and put something on
tape, but it's usually an accident. Maybe once a week I'll pick up the bass just
to goof around a bit.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I don't play very much at all, not nearly as much as I used to. Back
then our schedule was quite different; we didn't have much time off and there
was always a guitar around. Now when I come home, especially after an intense
period of recording, I like to get away from it completely. I have other
interests. I'm trying to recapture the athletic youth that I missed.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Likewise.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I love playing tennis or golf or throwing a baseball around. I like
to swim -- I train three days a week. I wish I'd taken it up when I was younger,
but it didn't suit me. I try to make up for it now. I live out in the country;
I garden and do things around the property.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>In our break times -- especially befor a tour and after an album -- music
takes a back seat to the other things. I think that's healthy. It may not be the
musician's creed, but when in the same band for so many years, you have to
develop different rules, rules that suit your lifestyle. Our work periods are
so intense, so concentrated. To keep it fresh, you have to explore other 
interests.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>I might not play guitar for acouple of months. Five or ten years ago,
I never went beyond a couple of days. But when I know we're going to start
rehersals, I'll start preparing six weeks in advance. Four a couple of weeks,
I'll spend three hours a day playing in my studio -- eyes closed, lots of reverb,
lights dow. I love it. Once we've established the set list, three to four weeks
befor the rehersals start, I try to practice six to eight hours a day. I make a
commitment to getting back into shape. By the time we're rehearsing, it's part
of my life again.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>It's a function of the kind of band we're in. If we were freelance
musicians, our regimen would be entirely different. We'd be practicing. You have
to stay fresh, because you never know when you're gonna get a call. It's a
combination of necessity and desire that drives you to practice. And I bet for
most musicians, rehearsal is more necessity than desire.

   <strong>GP : </strong>What would you tell a young player who's considering a career in music?
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Number one, it's not easy. Be prepared for a lot of work. Number two,
be determined and stick to your vision. Stay optimistic.

Team Players
</font></strong><p>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>At times you two sound like one big instrument. You've been playing
together how long now?
<dd>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>About 24 years. We played together for a year before the band started.
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>We know each other as players. We're comfortable saying just about
anything to each other and pushing ourselves in any direction. The main
drawback is the fear of short-changing your education by staying with the same
people. I guess that's the reason we keep switching producers every couple of
years. The three of us don't want to change, because we enjoy working together
and still have a lot of surprisingly common musical goals. It's such a 
satisfying situation that, whenever push comes to shove, we always count our
blessings. It's something you appreciate more the older you get.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>Occasionally I'll get an opportunity to work with other people. I'll
do a session for a couple of days, a few songs for a friend on the same label.
That's fun; it's enough to satisfy those outside interests.
</dd></dl>

<dl>
   <strong>GP : </strong>Like the Grateful Dead, you have a core group of followers who've been
into your music all along, and neither you nor the Dead seems particularly
concerned about Top-40 radio. Pursuing you own vision has allowed you to survive
all these years.
<dd>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>That's a good comparison. We've always considered Rush our career.
Maybe when we were teenagers we said, "Yeah, start a band, get rich and famous."
But when you realize you're not getting any chicks and you're not making a lot
of money, you re-examine you motives. I remember saying, "Look at Alfred
Hitchcock. He had a long career, made about 80 films. Some were real popular,
others not, but he kept going. He had enough confidence in his ability to know
that he was not going to disappear overnight. He saw it as a long-term thing,
which allowed him to experiment. Whether or not a project was accepted by the
masses, he always had a core following." It's a weird analogy, but it's always
made sense to me.
<p>
   <strong>Alex : </strong>But Ged, where is he today?
<p>
   <strong>Geddy : </strong>Scary thought.
