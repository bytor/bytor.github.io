<font size=+3>PRESTO CHANGE-0<br></font>
<font size=+1> Is it a coincidence that Rush's best-selling album is a 
back-to-basics
masterpiece that was written and recorded with "real" instruments and relies
on traditional elements like melody and feel?  The eighties, doomed to be
remembered as the age of technological overkill, really are over.</font><p>

<em>Taken from <b>Canadian Musician</b> -- April 1990</em><p>

Oh, those wascally wabbits that adorn the cover of the latest Rush album,
<b>Presto</b>. They're everywhere they shouldn't be.<p>

After escaping the confinements of a magician's chapeau -- curiously
suspended in mid-air -- the bevy of bunnies is having a grand old time,
munching grass and generally sniffing out new territory.<p>

It's no mere coincidence that the same parallels connotated by the Hugh Syme 
cover art can be drawn to the lengthy and successful career of Rush, 
Toronto's megapower rock trio, whose superconducting of intellectual analysis 
within the designs of contemporary rock concepts has been nothing short of 
revolutionary.<p>

For compatriots Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart have seemingly had to
pull rabbits from their hats and wave their magical wands in order to
overcome obstacles placed in their paths -- from reluctant radio programmers
to resistant rock critics. Through inexhaustive toil and spirit, relentless
determination and a touring schedule that would stunt hair growth and
promote curvature of the spine under normal circumstances, Rush has captured
the unwavering loyalty and well-earned respect of music lovers around the
globe -- to the point where their worldwide sales for sixteen albums over a 
recording profession spanning seventeen years has topped the thirty 
million mark.<p>

More significantly, some of those defiant ivory towers that once stood
immobile to the band's musical overtures are now teetering and crumbling.
The reason? <b>Presto</b>.<p>

Buoyed by new North American distribution agreements with Atlantic Records
in the U.S. and CBS in Canda, <b>Presto</b>'s sales figures have been skyrocketing
since the starter pistol's been fired. Even radio has been cheering: the
lead-off track, the put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is anthem "Show Don't
Tell", topped the persnickety Album Rock Tracks chart of music industry
bible Billboard as the most played rock radio song in the northern
Hemisphere for a couple of weeks.<p>

But just the general feel of <b>Presto</b> is enough to allow Geddy Lee, the
shrill-voiced multifaceted architect who manages to co-ordinate bass
playing, lead vocal and keyboard duties without imploding, to wax 
optimistic.<p>

"<b>Presto</b> is kind of a renewal to me," says the Toronto-born Lee, 
thirty-six. "It's a renewal of energy and a positive outlook, in musical 
terms and in personal terms, both in my place in the hand and my feeling about
recording."<p>

Recorded last summer at Le Studio in Morin Heights. Quebec, and McClear
Place in Toronto -- and mixed at London's Metropolis Studio with coproducer
Rupert Hine (Tine Turner, The Fixx) Lee said the focus of the album was
decided within the seeds of its creation.<p>

"From the word go, there was an emphasis on strong melodies and rich
choruses," explains Lee. "We wanted it to be more of a singer's album, and I
think you'll notice that the arrangements musically support the vocal."<p>

Neil Peart, the professor of polyrhythms and Rush's resident prosemaster,
also notices a difference about the new record.<p>

"<b>Presto</b> doesn't have a thematic message," he states. "There is no
manifesto, although there are many threads and a strong motif of looking at
life today and trying to act inside it."<p>

Humanity and the different aspects of human nature have formed the basis of
several Rush albums -- <b>A Farewell To Kings</b> and <b>Grace Under 
Pressure</b> among
them -- but rarely has the listener been able to make the connection so
clearly with the introspective nature of "Scars"" or the ecological alert
Hashed by "Red Tide".<p>

"Neil's lyrics to me are a lot more heartfelt," acknowledges Lee, who with
his counterparts have been nominated for a Juno Award for Producer Of The 
Year. "Presently, they're experience-oriented. I think they deal with living, 
and I find them inspirational because I think they're still ambitious. 
Whenever he's written something good, I feel it's more emotional."<p>

The Hamilton-born Peart, 37, has blazed a literary path for Rush since he
joined the band in '74 after original drummer John Rutsey departed for
health reasons. Ironically, his talents as a wordsmith were largely
undiscovered -- even by Peart himself.<p>

"We had no clue whatsoever that Neil would be a lyricist," said Lee,
speaking for himself and guitarist Alex Lifeson. "He joined the hand
strictly on his percussive skills. He was in the hand less than two weeks
before our first U.S. tour. It was as we were getting to know each other on
the road that Alex and I noticed a few differences.<p>

"Alex and I were teenage idiots together, but we didn't know who this
strange creature was. We did notice his incredible appetite for books and
for reading.<p>

"He also spoke English better than anyone we knew -- in fact, better than
anyone we had ever met," recalls Lee.<p>

Geddy maintains the duo suggested Neil try his hand at writing, but Peart
has a  different recollection.<p>

"I don't think anybody ever asked me," he said." I think I became lyricist
by default. I saw a vacuum and worked on a couple of things that I submitted
and were accepted."<p>

Inspired by socialist author Ayn Rand, Neil Peart became the catalyst for
establishing Rush as master musical interpreters of literary giants, and for
teleporting certain ideas into the stream of rock consciousness.<p>

Further adaptations of Rand's work -- as in <b>Caress Of Steel's</b> 
"The Fountain Of Lamneth" suite and the futuristic sci-fi fantasy 
epic <b>2112</b> -- were creative forays that expressed a thirst for 
knowledge. Cliffhanger adventures like those of "Cygnus X-l". which was 
begun on <b>A Farewell To Kings</b> and concluded on <b>Hemispheres</b>, 
challenged the imaginations of fans who were tired of well-worn rock cliches.<p>

"Initially, lyrics were never that important to me, internally or
externally," confesses Peart. "But dealing with words changed the way I
read, and introduced me to some new worlds.<p>

"It's also important that you see different points of view. I've read a lot
of American literature from the '20s and '30s, and what was interesting was
that all the authors of the time -- Hemingway, Steinbeck, Fitzgerald and
Faulkner -- saw it all so differently. yet they manage to strike at some
universal theme.<p>

"It's important to be conversant with other people's views, even if you
don't agree with them."<p>

Notwithstanding Peart's gift with words, Alex Lifeson's fabulous fretwork
and intricate bass playing from Lee, Rush's self-confessed baseball fanatic.
Geddy also feels that the band's personal objectives played a
large part in their early success.<p>

"We had lofty ambitions," notes Lee. "I think, at that age, you have visions
of rock glory. Neil's lyrics dealt with things that appealed to our
sensibility -- a noble kind of rock 'n' roll. It was always a bone of
contention that there was a kind of integrity about them that was great to
stand behind.<p>

"It feels very good as a young band to feel you're doing something
important. It's a motivating factor."<p>

When it comes to composition, Lee says he and Lifeson split
responsibilities, but balance each other out.<p>

"The two of us take on many different roles," Lee explains. "If Alex has a
strong idea that's very complete, I will act as the producer/editor. For
instance, with 'Show Don't Tell.' Alex came to me with a guitar riff that
didn't need to be touched. I contributed the chorus and we worked on the
verses together.<p>

"We each have our own different strengths. It works both ways and it's like
a puzzle. Sometimes Alex and I even forget about writing the music ahead of
time. A song like 'The Pass' needed to be written to the lyrics, which we
used as a script."<p>

Lee says the most satisfaction he gets from working on Rush albums these
days is as a composer.<p>

"Most rewarding to me is the writing," said Lee. "It's the single most 
interesting thing I do. Everything else is downhill after the song is
written. It's really the challenge.<p>

"There used to be a lot more emphasis on the playing. but now it's very much
the writing and arranging. It's a tremendous challenge and one that never
grows old. You always think you have a better song in you than the one you
just wrote. And there's always the tremendous fear of what if nothing comes
out? What if the well goes dry?"<p>

Lee admits he's satisfied with <b>Presto</b> but then cautions that "You always
feel much more positively about the last one you did."<p>

Specifically for <b>Presto</b>, Lee said Rush decided to streamline the sound and
steer away from synthesizers.<p>

"We wanted to stay away from keyboards for this album," acknowledges Lee.
"They can be quite a passive writing tool, and we wanted something more
forceful and less pastoral. I wrote a lot more on bass, which reminded me of
the old days when there was nothing more to write on.<p>

"This album was a real reaction against technology in a sense. I was getting
sick and tired of working with computers and synthesizers. Fortunately, so
was Rupert. We were united in our rebellion, and decided to use a more
organic approach. We made a pact to stay away from strings, pianos and
organs -- to stay away from digital technology. In the end, we couldn't 
resist using them for colour."<p>

Lee also underlined the importance of Rupert Hine's involvement during the
<b>Presto</b> sessions.<p>

"He felt very strongly about the material," Lee asserts. "He didn't feel it
necessary to force any of his ideas on us. He very much operated within the
philosophy of 'if something works, don't fix it.'"<p>

Apparently an extra set of ears were also appreciated in the studio.<p>

"Very early in the writing, Rupert pointed out a few tendencies we had as
writers which later proved to be important. Sometimes all you need is to be
shown where you're going, by someone objective, just to remind you that you
have millions of options.<p>

"Because we're players -- when we record we tend to go after perfect
performances. That's not an area Rupert feels is important. We have a
tendency to be so precise. It was very easy for us to get into a
machine-like mode. We get so perfectly tight in synch that when we fall
short, it hits our ear like an error."<p>

Peart -- who often sketches ideas out in a notebook before bringing them into
the studio during preproduction -- says he's unwilling to improvise for an
album without being prepared.<p>

"I'm not ready to do it," he confesses. "It took me so long to develop
confidence and facility. Luckily, I'm not forced to publish or perish. so I
always like the situation of refining what I have."<p>

He refuses to cast a critical eye on his past efforts, although he admits he
isn't perfect.<p>

"There are tons of little bits I can't listen to without wincing," says
Peart. "But there are no big mistakes in integrity or ethics, so you can't
reproach yourself. They all fed something, and as long as you're satisfied
with your current work, its purpose has been served. I don't think
everything we've done is great."<p>

Rather than name favorites, Peart feels his best lyrics are songs that have
been landmarks as creative achievements.<p>

"'Vital Signs' was a pivotal point in Rush's career," said Neil. "It was the
first time we tried a new style, which worked. 'Subdivisions' marked the
first time I could be graphic and autobiographical. 'The Analog Kid' was my
first attempt at non-fiction. For the longest time I stepped into characters
until I had my own confidence and technique to be able to step outside them
as a writer."<p>

"For 'Show Don't Tell' I adopted an attitude and character," Peart reveals.
"I took a stance and a good attitude and developed it. I think it's just a
sense of growing power in my own confidence and ability. I hope it reflects
growing technique. I find a trend for us since <b>Grace Under Pressure</b> 
has been cutting off abstractions.<p>

"The song 'Presto' reflects me and life as a theme, although I invented the
scenario. Irony is also a tool I used on this album. Most times I was
careful not to dramatize the situation. When you step into true fiction, you
use the fiction to explain the truth and reality."<p>

Currently in the midst of a North American tour that hits Canada in
May, both Lee and Peart feel the question of Rush grinding to a halt is an
obsolete one.<p>

"There are a lot of challenges left," said Peart. "I'm still learning how to
say personal things in an effective way -- and I see this vast ocean in
front of me."<p>

Lee states that the only thing that will stop Rush from continuing is public
demand.<p>

"I don't see there being any reason to stop," Lee declares. "I think the age
barrier in rock 'n' roll has gone. I think the bottom line is whether or not
you sell records. If you stop selling, that can hasten the demise of any
creative outfit."<p>
