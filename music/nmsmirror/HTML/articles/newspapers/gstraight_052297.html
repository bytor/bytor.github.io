<font size=+1>RUSH TO JUDGMENT: Rush at General Motors Place on Friday 
May 16</font><br>
<b>by Steve Newton</b><p>

Although they've sold more than 35 million records and been a major force in
the hard-rock world for 23 years, it appears as though Rush's status as an
arena-packing concert draw -- at least in Vancouver -- has slipped a few notches.
There were scads of empty seats at last friday's GM Place show, in fact, the
upper levels were completely baren of bodies, which is something you
wouldn't have seen at a Rush show ten years ago. But if the band's untrendy
prog-rock has failed to attract hordes of new fans, its powerful hold on a
core of devoted, near fanatical followers continues -- as evidenced by the
coke-smoking rowdy seated next to me in Row 13, who came all the way from
Calgary so he could leap up, splatter beer around, and scream "Yeah! Best
band in the world!" at the top of his lungs.<p>

For its own part, Rush worked hard to please longtime fans during a two and
a half hour "greatest hits" set, but it was hampered by substandard sound in
the form of Alex Lifeson's over bearing high-end guitar mix. And while you
couldn't blame the band for trying to promote its new Test for Echo CD, an
abundance of material from that unspectacular release got little response.
Not one tune from Rush's Zeppelin-esque debut lp made the set list, and it's
as if the band petulantly boycotts that "74 disc simply because it's the
only one Neil Peart didn't play on. Come on, guys, give John Rutsey his due
too, eh? It's not easy being the Pete Best of Canada.<p>

It was when the band did opt to venture back to the mid-'70s that it
received its strongest audience response and delivered the marathon
concert's most memorable moments. When the stage's video-screen backdrop
displayed the familiar album coverimage from all the worlds a stage -- a naked
man standing in front of a glowing red circle/star many of those in
attendance realized it was "2112" time, and Rush didn't disappoint on a
sizeable section of the multipart epic. The band's technical prowess was
prominently displayed here, and a camera set directly above Peart's massive
drum kit offered an eye opening on his intricate art-rock percussion style.
During one particularly busy segment of "2112", the Buddy Rich of rock
actually knocked one of his larger cymbals clear off its stand. Too bad
Rutsey wasn't there to chuckle vengefully at the bizzare sight.<p>
