[Announcer introduces Off The Record special]<br>
[Chemistry is played as bed]<p>

<b>GL:</b>  We always wanted to be that, wanted to be the, the hot player, you
know?  That was our goal early on and then we sorta wanted to be the
world's smallest symphony orchestra which we're still trying to do...<p>

<b>MT:</b>  Presenting Toronto's most concise symphony orchestra, featuring
Geddy Lee, Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson.  Rush - Off The Record.  You're a
successful band.  You can record anywhere you want in the world, so where
do you go?  Paris?  London?  Montserrat?  How about all of the above?
Sound extravagant?  Geddy Lee:<p>

<b>GL:</b>  I guess in our own minds we can afford that kind of luxury to keep
ourselves fired up, you know, tuned up.  Every three weeks we went to a
different studio, and the first two studios were in England; the next one
was in Montserrat, the Caribbean; the next one we went home for the first
time in maybe ten years; we recorded three, four weeks in Toronto and we
mixed the album in Paris; and, through all that time [Chemistry fades
into Force Ten: used as bed then faded up for vocals] we were very, you
know, stimulated and very interested in the record.  It kept everybody
fresh and I think it kept giving us a new outlook on the album; and we
kept coming in contact with different, you know, responses and for us at
this stage I think it works really well to do that, to move around.  It
is more expensive than your average way of recording, but you know we're
very conscientious and I think the money we spend doing that we save in
other ways...<p>

[Force Ten played to end]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  Do you think that all the travelling you did gave the album a more
international flavour?<p>

<b>GL:</b>  I think it gave us an international flavour, I don't know if the
album, you know, smells of it or not but it certainly was great for us
because it turns the work experience into a whole full living experience
[Big Money played as bed, faded up for vocals] which I think is more
necessary for us at this stage.  You know, fifteen-odd years or whatever
its been in Rush I think you have to, you have to stop looking at it as
separate from your life because its part of your life, you know, its what
you do so you don't wanna just go "I'm going to work and then I'll live",
you know, you wanna do it all at the same time.  You know, it's gotta be
all one thing and that's the necessity for saying, "Well, I could either
mix at home or I can mix in this cheap studio around the corner; or I can
go to Paris, spend a few extra dollars and have a wonderful new
experience mixing, so I vote for the latter, you know?  Let's have some fun.<p>

[Mission played as bed, faded up for vocals]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  I'm Mary Turner talking with Geddy Lee of Rush, Off The Record.<p>

[During Mission instrumental bridge]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  Why name an album "Hold Your Fire"?  Had Rush been watching too many
Arnold Schwarzenegger movies?<p>

<b>GL:</b>  I think it relates to the creative process, the burning desire to do
something and how important it is to keep it, to keep your fire lit, you
know, and to keep it going regardless of what you have to persevere, you
know, regardless of circumstances I think its important to hold yourself
together or stick to your guns basically.  Its more relating to the
personal inner flame, you know, hold it.  As the beginning of the song
"Mission" sort of explains.  That was the intent and the concept of that
particular song and the title of the album.<p>

[Mission faded up as vocals resume, used as bed when vocals end]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  Rush has been recording music for thirteen years and that's a number
that makes them feel relaxed rather than superstitious.<p>

<b>GL:</b>  I think there was a more confident approach to making this record.
I think we were more relaxed in the sense that we said to ourselves,
"Okay, this project's gonna take this long, it's gonna take about six
months of our lives [High Water played as bed].  I don't want to be
intense and do nothing but make this record for the next six months.  I
wanna plan it out in such a way that I can take time off to be with my
family.  I can take time off to enjoy the other things that happen to
interest me right now and pursue a life that this band is part of and not
separated from."  Saying that the outset and realizing that the record's
not gonna fall apart if you go away from it for a week, you know, and
say, "Every three weeks let's take a week off and eventually we'll finish
the record in good time because we're very, you know, we know how
responsible we are in the studio, very responsible in the studio, we work
very hard when there's work to be done so we know we'll do the record in
time and we'll do it right so let's not panic and let's have some
confidence about it" and I think that shows in the record.<p>

[High Water faded up for first verse & chorus, cut to instrumental
bridge, used as bed]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  Rush is a private club when it comes to recording.  Having outside
musicians work on their albums is still a very controversial idea to
Geddy, Alex and Neil.  So how did Til Tuesday's Aimee Mann end up singing
on this record?<p>

<b>GL:</b>  That was a really interesting idea for us.  "Hell, let's get a girl
in here", you know, it was a neat idea, you know, we've been so insular.
We very rarely work with other people but, you know, well we've worked
with Andy Richards on keyboards on Power Windows, it was very successful
and a really, really pleasant experience and we continued on this
record.  And we worked with string arrangers on the last record, on Power
Windows, you know, so all those experiences with new people were very
exciting for us.  We thought, "we're learning from this, and, let's take
it another step further, let's get a vocalist in here to give us a little
texture in the vocal department" [Time Stand Still begins, used as bed,
faded up for vocals] and we thought we had the perfect part for a female
voice which I think it was.  And, we listened to a lot of records, liked
Aimee's a lot and asked her if she would sing on it which she graciously
agreed to do.<p>

[Time Stand Still played to end]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  It's four o'clock in the morning.  A tired musician sits slumped in
a seat at the back of a long, luxurious tour bus.  The rest of the band
has been sleeping unsoundly for a couple of hours.  The bus is filled
with old cigarette smoke and unfriendly shadows.  The only illumination
comes from the streetlights as they blur past the windows and the faint
glow from the dashboard.  The semi-awake drummer taps out a melody with
his ink pen on a yellow legal pad.  By the time the bus arrives at the
next stop on their tour itinerary, he'll have a new song.  Doesn't that
sound romantic?  Well most of the time that's not the way it happens.
Put that same drummer in a well-lit room that's not moving and he'll be a
lot happier.  We'll hear why creativity is often inspired by the glow of
a personal computer screen right after this on Rush, Off The Record.<p>

<b>MT:</b>  We're back with Rush, Off The Record.<p>

[Freewill played, then used as bed during instrumental break]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  Synthesizer has never been a four letter word to Rush.  When it
comes to technology, this is a band that was born to compute.<p>

<b>GL:</b>  Well it was always, in the last few years we've used
synthesizer-oriented computers like PPG's, Fairlights, that kind of
thing.  But this was the first time we had an actual Mac set up, with
software made by one of these companies that does music software.
Software called Performer.  That really turns your computer into a
multi-track recording device and a sequencing device.  It doesn't store
sound, but basically stores notes so I can write, you know, all different
keyboard parts and store them in the computer and play them back at will,
screw around with them and when I wanna change the arrangement I can just
cut and paste the arrangement around as opposed to playing it on tape
recorder ten different ways and listening to which one I like best, I can
cut and paste ten different versions.  So it's very helpful, in a lot of
ways.<p>

[Tom Sawyer played, then used as bed during instrumental break]<p>

<b>GL:</b>  Neil used it quite a lot, he wrote all his lyrics, or, some of his
lyrics for this album on the Mac; he used one as well and he finds it
easy because he can then play with words in the same way, you know, cut
and paste and drop them out and look at it this way and print it out and
look at it and see what works and what doesn't work.  I found it
difficult when he was starting to give me lyrics that were printed out of
his computer because I'm so used to his little hand-written lyric sheets
that he gives me, 'cause they're always so cool and he draws these little
pictures on the top of them and stuff, you know, he has, for like, you
know, thirteen years now; so, I think, I can't remember the song, I think
it was Prime Mover or Lock & Key [New World Man begins, used as bed,
faded up for vocals] on this album was the first one he actually handed
me this, you know, this print-out of the lyrics and it was so weird, it
felt so cold to me, it's like, "I feel uncomfortable with this" and I
think he just looked around for different fonts until he found, found one
that was a little warmer and it was more attractive to me.  Makes his job
much easier.<p>

<b>MT:</b>  Rush:  for thirteen years they've been mixing current events with
power chords.  Is it an atmospheric condition that's kept them together?
We'll hear from Geddy Lee after this.  Off The Record, I'm Mary Turner.<p>

[Commercials]<br>
[Lock & Key played as bed, faded up for vocals]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  We're back with Geddy lee of Rush, Off The Record.<p>

[During instrumental break]<p>

<b>MT:</b>  Here you are on another tour.  Did you ever think when you were
first starting out in Canada that you'd be doing this forever, for a living?<p>

<b>GL:</b>  I never, I never thought that far ahead and I never dreamed that we
would be together or this successful for this long.  Never imagined it.
I don't know what I imagined but I didn't, I didn't imagine this.  You
know, it's hard.  [Spirit of Radio faded in, used as bed, faded up for
vocals]  You just sorta take it as it comes.  You know, you always wish
that you could have a nice, long, fruitful career.  You don't know what
can, what atmospheric conditions are gonna permit that.<p>

[Spirit of Radio played to end]<p>

<b>GL:</b>  I think there's been a conviction in our music that I think a core
of our audience has believed in and has accepted and has said to
themselves that we're gonna stick with this band just to see what happens
and to grow with them until they let me down, I guess, and I mean that's
what most people do, I guess, with bands.  You listen to them and then
when you think they're going off in an area that you're not into then
you, you drop out of that scene, you move onto something else, but I
think that core has kept, you know, our, we've had a solid core that's
kept us around for a long time.  That's, you know, I think one reason
that we've been, I mean, I'm surprised that we have had such a hard core
following for so long because really we've been changing so much and
we're not the same band we were, like, eight records ago at all, I don't
think.  Not on the surface anyway.  [Limelight played as bed, faded up
for vocals]  Certainly what makes us tuck is probably very similar.  It
doesn't sound the same.  It doesn't, it doesn't feel the same.  So I
don't understand why, why someone could like us back then could still
like us now unless they've just grown with us and maybe that's really
what the answer is.  But I think there must be something in our music
every time out that appeals to new people too otherwise we couldn't have
remained as successful.<p>
