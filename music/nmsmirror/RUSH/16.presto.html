Show Don't Tell
---- ----- ----
How many times do you hear it?
It goes on all day long
Everyone knows everything
And no one's ever wrong
Until later

Who can you believe?
It's hard to play it safe
But apart from a few good friends
We don't take anything on faith
Until later

Show Don't Tell

SHOW ME DON'T TELL ME
You've figured out the score
SHOW ME DON'T TELL ME
I've heard it all before
SHOW ME DON'T TELL ME
I don't care what you say
SHOW ME DON'T TELL ME

You can twist perceptions
Reality won't budge
You can raise objections
I will be the judge
And the jury

I'll give it due reflection
Watching from the fence
Give the jury direction
Based on the evidence
I, the jury

SHOW ME DON'T TELL ME
Hey - order in the court
SHOW ME DON'T TELL ME
Let's try to keep it short
SHOW ME DON'T TELL ME

<strong><font size=+1>What is "Chain Lightning" about?</font></strong><p>
<dd>
<strong>Neil Peart ("Rush Profiled!"): </strong>"I'm a weather fanatic -- 
I really love weather, and I watch the
weather and look for a good weatherman.  And, one night I was watching
it, and there are two incidents in that song that are synchronicity to
one weather report, where the weatherman showed a picture of sun dogs,
and described them, and they are just two little points of light that
appear at sunset, often in the winter when the sky is clear and
crystalline, and they are like little prisms, and they sit about ten
degrees north and south of the setting sun, and they are just
beautiful little diamonds of light, and often times there's a circle
of light - one line, that connects them.  So they are a really
beautiful natural phenomenon, and I love the name too.  'Sun dogs'
just has a great sound to it.  And in that same weather forecast, the
weatherman announced a meteor shower that night, and so my daughter
and I went out on the lake in the middle of the night and watched this
meteor shower.  So the whole idea of the song was response and how
people respond to things, and it's a thing I've found a lot in
traveling around the world, too.  It's not enough just to travel and
see things.  You have to respond to them - you have to feel them, and
a lot of the thrust of that song is how things are transferred, like
chain lightning or enthusiasm or energy or love are things that are
contagious, and if someone feels them, they are easily transferrable
to another person, or in the case of watching a meteor shower, it's
made more special if there is someone else there.  'Reflected in
another pair of eyes' is the idea that it's a wonderful thing already,
just you and the meteor shower, but if there's someone else there
with you to share it, then it multiplies, you know, it becomes
exponentially a bigger experience, so response is a theme that recurs
in several of the songs and was one of my probably dominant sub-themes
in the writing."

Chain Lightning
----- ---------
Energy is contagious
Enthusiasm spreads
Tides respond to lunar gravitation
Everything turns in synchronous relation

Laughter is infectious
Excitement goes to my head
Winds are stirred by planets in rotation
Sparks ignite and spread new information

Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate

Sun dogs fire on the horizon
Meteor rain stars across the night
This moment may be brief
But it can be so bright

Hope is epidemic
Optimism spreads
Bitterness breeds irritation
Ignorance breeds imitation

Sun dogs fire on the horizon
Meteor rain stars across the night
This moment may be brief
But it can be so bright
Reflected in another source of light
When the moment dies
The spark still flies
Reflected in another pair of eyes

Dreams are sometimes catching
Desire goes to my head
Love responds to your invitation
Love responds to imagination

Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate

<font size=+1><strong>What is "The Pass" about?</font></strong><p>
<dd>
<strong>Neil Peart ("Rush Profiled!"): </strong>
"There was a lot I wanted to address in that song, and it's probably one of 
the hardest ones I've ever written.  I spent a lot of time on it, refining 
it, and even more doing research.  There was one song previously, 
called 'Manhattan Project' where I wanted to write about the birth of the 
nuclear age.  Well, easier said than done, especially when [writing] lyrics, 
you've got a couple of hundred words to say what you want to say.  So each 
word counts, and each word had better be accurate, and so I found in the 
case of the Manhattan Project, I was having to go back and read histories
of the time, histories of the place, biographies of all the people involved, 
and that's not without its own rewards, but it's a lot of work to go to to 
write a song - having to read a dozen books and collate all your knowledge 
and experience just so you can write, you know, if it says the scientists
were in the desert sands, well, make sure they were and why, and all that.<p>

So with this song it was the same.  I felt concerned about it, but, at the 
same time, I didn't want the classic thing of 'Oh, life's not so bad, you 
know, it's worth living' and all that.  I didn't want one of those pat, kind
of cliched, patronizing statements, so I really worked hard to find out true 
stories, and among the people that I write to are people who are going to 
universities, to MIT, and collecting stories from them about people they had 
known and what they felt, and why the people had taken this desperate step 
and all of that and trying really hard to understand something that, 
fundamentally, to me is totally un-understandable.  I just can't relate to 
it at all, but I wanted to write about it.  And the facet that I most wanted 
to write about was to de-mythologize it - the same as with 'Manhattan 
Project' - it de-mythologized the nuclear age, and it's the same thing with 
this facet - of taking the nobility out of it and saying that yes, it's sad, 
it's a horrible, tragic thing if someone takes their own life, but let's not 
pretend it's a hero's end.  It's not a triumph.  It's not a heroic epic.  It's 
a tragedy, and it's a personal tragedy for them, but much more so for the 
people left behind, and I really started to get offended by the samurai kind 
of values that were attached to it, like here's a warrior that felt it was 
better to die with honor, and all of that kind of offended me.  I can 
understand someone making the choice; it's their choice to make.  I can't 
relate to it, and I could never imagine it, for myself, but still I thought 
it's a really important thing to try to get down."

<font size=+1><strong>Geddy on the song:</font></strong><p>
<dd>
<strong>Geddy Lee (Guitar World, March 1990): </strong>
"Still, there are certain songs, like 'The Pass,' where I felt it was more
important to keep the lyrics intact and to build up a musical statement that's
born out of the message of the song.  In a case like that, I have to do a lot
of thinking before a single note is written and I really immerse myself into
the song.  I mean, if I have to sing Neil's lyrics, I have to feel some sort
of relationship with what he's talking about.  I have to feel in concert with
them in order to make it believable, to myself and to the listener.  So there
is a lot of conversation that goes down about each song before I start writing
melodies."

The Pass
--- ----
Proud swagger out of the schoolyard
Waiting for the world's applause
Rebel without a conscience
Martyr without a cause

Static on your frequency
Electrical storm in your veins
Raging at unreachable glory
Straining at invisible chains

And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
Staring down into a heartless sea
Can't face life on a razor's edge
Nothing's what you thought it would be

All of us get lost in the darkness
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars
All of us do time in the gutter
Dreamers turn to look at the cars
turn around and turn around and turn around
Turn around and walk the razor's edge
Don't turn your back
And slam the door on me

It's not as if this barricade
Blocks the only road
It's not as if you're all alone
In wanting to explode

Someone set a bad example
Made surrender seem all right
The act of a noble warrior
Who lost the will to fight

And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge
Staring down into a heartless sea
Done with life on a razor's edge
Nothing's what you thought it would be

No hero in your tragedy
No daring in your escape
No salutes for your surrender
Nothing noble in your fate
Christ, what have you done?

War Paint

Girl before the mirror
Appraises her disguise
Child become a mother
Tries to fix her eyes
No more of his excuses
It has to be today
She can keep her fantasy
If she can get away

Paint her name on a one-way street
Painted cheeks with angry heat
Wounded pride on painted eyes
Paint the night with battlecries

All puffed up with vanity
We see what we want to see
To the beautiful and the wise
The mirror always lies

Boy before the mirror
Checks his camoflauge
Polishes his armor
And the charger in the garage
No more lame excuses
It has to be tonight
He can take the princess
If he can take the fight

Pound the drums with martial beat
Pound the streets with marching feet
Wounded pride, distorted eyes
Paint the night with battlecries

All puffed up with vanity
We see what we want to see
To the powerful and the wise
The mirror always lies

Boys and girls together
Mistake conceit for pride
- ambition for illusion
- dreams for self-delusion
Girls and boys together
See what it is we lack
Boys and girls together
Let's paint the mirror black
Paint it black

<font size=+1><strong>What is "Scars" about?</font></strong><p>
<dd>
<strong>Neil Peart ("Rush Profiled!"): </strong>
"I think it's part of everyone's experience that a certain record reflects a 
certain period of their life, and that's a pleasurable scar, you know, 
there's a mark left on you, a psychological fingerprint left by a very 
positive experience.  And music is an easy one, but it translates to so many 
other parts of life where it's a given that, for instance, the sense of smell 
is one of the strongest forces in your memory, where a given smell will 
suddenly conjure up a whole time of your life, and again, it triggers another 
scar, it triggers another psychological imprint that was left by a pleasurable
thing.  So it was just, again, the metaphor of scars and using it to say that,
as the song does, that these are positive and negative aspects of life that 
have both left their mark.  Trying to make it universal, it's not 
autobiographical, and I took a whole autobiographical story of my own and
made it one line, basically, but there are other things in there, parts of 
life that I've responded to in a sense of joy, and in a sense of compassion, 
and there's the exaltation of walking down a city street and feeling like 
you're above the pavement, and Christmas in New York is the perfect time
to feel that, really, where you just get charged up by the whole energy and 
the positive feelings of it all."

Do you add effects to your guitar during remix, or do you print them to tape 
when tracking?<p></em>

<strong>Alex Lifeson (Guitar Player, November 1991): </strong>
"I much prefer to print to tape. On "Scars" [Presto], for instance, I
got free rein on all atmospheric guitar stuff. Some producers we worked with
in the past would have said, "No, let's print your guitar perfectly clean and
experiment later," but it's never the same. I say do it and live with it."

Scars
-----
I've stood upon my mountaintop
And shouted at the sky
Walked above the pavement
With my sense amplified
- I get this feeling

All my nerves are naked wires
Tender to the touch
Sometimes super-sensitive
But who can care too much?
- I get this feeling

Scars of pleasure
Scars of pain
Atmospheric changes
Make them sensitive again

Each emotional injury
Leaves behind its mark
Sometimes they come tumbling out
Like shadows in the dark
- I get this feeling

When I think about all I have seen
And all I'll never see
When I think about the people
Who have opened up to me
- I get this feeling

Snow falls deep around my house
And holds the winter light
I've heard the lions hunting
In the Serengeti night
- I get this feeling

Forests turned to factories
And river, sea, and sky
Hungry child in the desert
And the flies that cloud her eyes
- I get this feeling

Pleasure leaves a fingerprint
As surely as mortal pain
In memories they resonate
And echo back again

Presto
------
If I could wave my magic wand...

I am made from the dust of the stars
And the oceans flow in my veins
Here I hide in the heart of the city
Like a stranger coming out of the rain

The evening plane rises up from the runway
Over constellations of light
I look down into a million houses
And wonder what you're doing tonight

If I could wave my magic wand
I'd make everything all right

I'm not one to believe in magic
But I sometimes have a second-sight
I'm not one with a sense of proportion
When my heart still changes overnight

I had a dream of a winter garden
A midnight rendezvous
Silver, blue, and frozen silence
What a fool I was for you

I had a dream of the open water
I was swimming away out to sea
So deep I could never touch bottom
What a fool I used to be

If I could wave my magic wand
I'd set everybody free

I'm not one to believe in magic
Though my memory has a second-sight
I'm not one to go pointing my finger
When I radiate more heat than light

Don't ask me
I'm just improvising
My illusion of careless flight
Can't you see
My temperature's rising
I radiate more heat than light

Don't ask me
I'm just sympathizing
My illusions a harmless flight
Can't you see
My temperature's rising
I radiate more heat than light

<font size=+1><strong>What is the song "Anagram (for Mongo)" 
about?</font></strong><p>
<dd>
<strong>Geddy Lee ("Rush Profiled!"): </strong>
"It doesn't really say one thing; it says a bunch of little things, and
I think that's OK as long as it sounds good.  You know, as long as it
rolls off the tongue kind of thing?  So I think different songs are
different exercises, to a degree, and I think that if they feel like
exercises, then there's something wrong with the song.  But if they
can slip by in a kind of cohesive and fluid way, or if the effect is
to be disjoint, and sometimes that's what you're after.  Sometimes you
want it to be jarring and disjointed and nonsensical.  I think it
depends on what you're trying to do, and whether you've achieved it in
your mind, and whether it actually worked, and 'Anagram,' I think,
did work, even though it's a game - the whole song is a game.  The
choruses are quite smooth and quite interesting, and they have a nice
sound to them and they kind of mock the whole song itself, so I think
it was effective there."

Anagram (for Mongo)
------- ---- ------
There's a snake coming out of the darkness
Parade from paradise
End the need for eden
Chase the dreams of merchandise

There is tic and toc in atomic
Leaders make a deal
The cosmic is largely comic
A con they couldn't conceal

There is no safe seat at the feast
Take your best stab at the beast
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Raise the art to resistance
Danger dare to be grand
Pride reduced to humble pie
Diamonds down to sand

Take heart from earth and weather
The brightness of new birth
Take heart from the harvest
Shave the harvest from the earth

Reasoning is partly insane
Image just an eyeless game
The night is turning thin
The saint is turning to sin

Miracles will have their claimers
More will bow to Rome
He and she are in the house
But there's only me at home

Rose is a rose of splendor
posed to respond in the end
lonely things like nights,
I find, end finer with a friend

I hear in the rate of her heart
A tear in the heat of the art

The night turns thin
The saint turns to sin

<font size=+1><strong>What is "Red Tide" about?</font></strong><p>
<dd>
<strong>Neil Peart ("Rush Profiled!"): </strong>
"It's a bit of a selfish concern, really.  I really love wildlife, and I 
spend a lot of my time in the outdoors when I'm not working, so that's 
important to me.  One of my main hobbies is cycling, so air quality kind of 
becomes of critical importance.  So it is a selfish thing, and it's something
I've written about before, on the previous album - the song 'Second Nature'.  
So, again, you want to say things in a way that is not only not preachy, but 
also not boring.  So finding the images like 'Second Nature' - I was really 
fond of that analogy of saying 'we want our homes to be a second nature', 
you know.  That was, again, taking a common phrase and being able to twist 
it to say what you want it to say.  So, with 'Red Tide'  it was a little more 
adamant, because I think the time is a little more critical, and I had to be
firmer about it, but still there are ways of getting at it, and to me there 
are jokes in there, too, that probably no one in the world will ever get, 
but in the first verse, when I'm talking about 'Nature's new plague' and 
then 'Lovers pausing at the bedroom door to find an open store' and all that,
to me that was obviously referring to AIDS, but it was the irony of modern 
life, you know, where spontaneous love still certainly does occur, but here 
are two lovers who have just met in the middle of the night, and they have 
to go find a store before they can consummate their new relationship, you 
know, and to me, when I put those things down, I have a smile, but I know 
that it's one that will never be shared."

"I wanted to get a lot of tension in that solo because the song is quite
intense.  There's a kind of disturbing feeling about that solo, which I think 
ties it all together well.  The song is angry.  Neil is basically a very

our environment.  So I wanted the music, and especially my solo, to reflect

Red Tide
--- ----
Nature has some new plague
To run in our streets
History some new wrinkle
We are doomed to repeat
Fugitives at the bedroom door
Lovers pause to find an open store
Rain is burning on the forest floor
And the red tide kisses the shore

THIS IS NOT A FALSE ALARM
THIS IS NOT A TEST

Stay out of the sun
It only burns my skin
Sky full of poison
And the atmosphere's too thin
Bless the sun, the rain no more
River running like an open sore
Black wind falling to the ocean floor
and the red tide washes ashore

THIS IS NOT A FALSE ALARM
THIS IS NOT A TEST
Nowhere we can fly away
Nowhere we can rest
The party is disrupted by
An uninvited guest

Deadline approaches
For the weary land
It used to be something
But we let it run down in our hands
Too late for debate, too bad to ignore
Quiet rebellion leads to open war
Bring a sea-change to the factory floor
As the red tide covers the shore

Now's the time to turn the tide
Now's the time to fight
Let us not go gently
To the endless winter night
Now's the time to make the time
While hope is still in sight
Let us not go gently
To the endless winter night

Scissors cut the paper
Cut the paper to the bone
Hand over fist
Paper around the stone
Scissors cut the paper
And the rock must stand alone

I could disappear into the crowd
But not if I keep my head in the clouds
I could walk away so proud
It's easy enough if you don't laugh too loud

I thought I was okay alone
Wait for the postman and the telephone
Lost in a world of my own
I thought I could run alone
Thought I could run through the night alone

Hand over hand
Doesn't seem so much
Hand over hand
Is the strength of the common touch

You talk as we walk along
You never imagined I could be so wrong
Humming your favorite song
You know I've hated that song for so long

How can we ever agree?
Like the rest of the world
We grow farther apart
I swear you don't listen to me
Holding my hand to my heart
Holding my fist to my racing heart

Take a walk outside myself
In some exotic land
Greet a passing stranger
Feel the strength in his hand
Feel the world expand

I feel my spirit resist
But I open up my fist
Lay hand over hand over

<strong>Geddy Lee (Guitar World, March 1990): </strong>
"On a tune like 'Available Light,' where the bass just provides some simple, 
low-end support, I'd rather play the keyboards and sing.  It's just a question 
of what instru- ment will be rewarding to play from a player's point of view.  
If the keyboard is simply playing a strict, four-chord repeating pattern, then 
I'd rather just program it into some MIDI pedal and have some fun playing

Available Light
--------- -----
The restless wind
Has seen all things
In every kind of light
Rising with the full moon
To go howling through the night

The sleepless wind
Has heard all things
Between the sea and sky
In the canyons of the city
You can hear the buildings cry

Oh the wind can carry
All the voices of the sea
Oh the wind can carry
All the echoes home to me

Run with wind and weather
To the music of the sea
All four winds together
Can't bring the world to me
Chase the wind around the world
I want to look at life -
In the available light

Play of light
A photograph
The way I used to be
Some half-forgotten stranger
Doesn't mean that much to me

Trick of light
Moving picture
Moments caught in flight
Make the shadows darker
Or the colors shine too bright

Oh the light can carry
All the visions of the sea
Oh the light can carry
All the images to me

Run to light from shadow
Sun gives me no rest
Promise offered in the east
Broken in the west
Chase the sun around the world
I want to look at life -
In the available light

All four winds together
Can't bring the world to me
Shadows hide the play of light
So much I want to see
Chase the light around the world
I want to look at life -
In the available light

I'll go with the wind
I'll stand in the light
</PRE>
