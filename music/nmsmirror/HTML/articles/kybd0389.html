    Three may be the lucky number for Rush.  The trio's latest release,
<strong>A Show  of Hands</strong>, marks their third attempt to mix the excitement of
concert  performance with the cleanliness of studio technology.  Their
two previous  albums left the band feeling unsatisfied: On <strong>All the
World's a Stage</strong>,  recorded in 1976, they considered the sound too raw,
while <strong>Exit Stage  Left</strong>, from 1981, seemed too slick and overproduced.<p>

    But now, according to triple-threat bassist/keyboardist/vocalist
Geddy Lee,  they've finally got it right.  <strong>A Show of Hands</strong> [Mercury
836346] features  the best performances from their last two tours, each
recorded with  crystalline clarity. "Spontaneity is the most elusive part
of performing,"  he explains.  "When you've got a tape machine running
during a show, every  little thing you do that might not be exact shouts
at you and breaks your  concentration.  We tried to overcome that on this
album by taping so many  shows that after a while we were bound to get a
good one."<p>

    Though they captured more than 20 concerts, the bulk of the double
album  was taken from the last of these gigs.  "We played the last three
shows in  Birmingham, England." Lee recalls.  "On the second night, we
filmed a live  video.  It was a major shoot: 12 cameras, 60 people
running around  backstage.  That made us so uptight that on the last
concert, after they  had been taken away, we felt incredibly relaxed
onstage.  It was almost  like an off night.  So we played very
naturally."<p>

    Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson, and drummer Neil Peart exhibit their
usual  precision and finesse on <strong>Hands</strong>, running through a selection of
their  greatest hits like Michael Jordon icing the Miami Heat defense. 
Perhaps  the most impressive single element on these cuts is Lee's
seamless segues  between bass guitar and keyboards.  Planted behind his
PPG Wave 2.2, with  a Roland D-50 on one side, a Yamaha KX76 on the
other, and a Steinberger  bass dangling from his neck, he jumps from
strings to keys, keys to  strings, while tapping out additional lines on
Korg and Moog pedals and  singing those trademark stratospheric high
notes.  Despite the obvious  disaster potential, Lee goes through this
routine night after night with  nary a slip.<p>

    "On our Power Windows tour, things got so complicated that I thought
it  would be impossible to remember everything," he laughs.  "So I had
color  charts made up by a friend of mine.  We assigned different colors
to each  block of the KX76, so when we did, say, `Big Money', I'd flip
the chart,  and there were these color-coordinated blocks of this synth
or that sound.   Well it turns out to be a lot easier to memorize than I
thought it would  be.  If you can memorize a thousand notes in a song, it
isn't too hard to  memorize four different colors."<p>

    On some songs, such as "Force Ten," Lee's choreography is so
intricate that  he's literally dancing.  With arms and legs flailing
through Rush's  typically ornate arrangements, it's obviously harder to
play accurately.   Fortunately, Lee's KX76 helps him cut down the
clinkers.  "If I'm going  back and forth from playing very fast bass
lines to throwing my hands on  the keyboard to hit one sound, it's easier
to assign that sound to three  adjacent notes.  That gives me a margin of
error.  I don't want to worry  about being too precise if I'm just
triggering a sample.  Rather than  trying to hit a C in the middle of a
frenzied part, I'll assign the same  event to the C, D, and E."<p>

    Along with his onstage setup, Lee marshals a powerful array of
offstage  synths and samplers in trying to duplicate the band's rich
studio textures.   Given the care he puts into orchestrating his parts on
record, this is no  simple job.  On such songs as "Mission," from <strong>Hold
Your Fire</strong>, the  arrangements are largely built around synth textures, so
approximating them  onstage is crucial.<p>

    "That whole song was made up of some very complex pads, which added
up to  what seemed like a very simple sound," Lee remembers.  "We had six
or seven  pads, each one slightly different.  I had a choral sound from
the  [Sequential] Prophet VS, and a slightly higher brassy sound from the
DX7.   I think [studio keyboardist] Andy Richards added a couple of
sounds from  his Fairlight and PPG.  Then our producer, Peter Collins,
recorded an  English Brass band playing those chords with their lovely
muted sounds.  In  the final mix, we put all those things together.<p>

    "When we do `Mission' live, it's a sample of those chords in
combination  with three other keyboards I'm playing.  It's a really rich
sound, and you  can hear the vocal quality quite well.  Toward the end of
the song, I raise  it up an octave, and suddenly you can hear the
different characters of each  keyboard.  That `Whiter Shade of Pale'
organ sound becomes more prominent  too."<p>

    Vocal samples abound on <strong>Hands</strong> as well.  "That's an actual 30-voice
choir  on `Marathon,'" Lee notes.  "We didn't want to just use a tape of
a choir  singing, so we divided the choir up into many different samples. 
I play a  fairly simple keyboard part, but it triggers each segment of
the choir  sample when we need it.  It's a very long chorus at the end,
with two key  changes, and at each key change the arrangement changes
slightly.  With the  first one, an orchestra joins the choir.  For the
last one, it's the same  choir mixed with some strings.  And every three
bars or so I'll change a  note to bring in another part of the choir. 
That's a lot of sampling time,  so for that tune we had to use three
[Akai] S900s."<p>

    In past interviews, Lee has modestly quibbled with those who consider
him  one of the top keyboard players in rock, protesting that his
technique has  been too rudimentary to warrant serious praise.  Now,
however, that may be  changing, as this fleet-fingered bass player has
finally gotten around to  taking piano lessons.
<p>
    "I have to tell you, it's really boring," he admits.  "I'm supposed
to  start each day by practicing the Hanon exercises, doing scales in
contrary  motion, and that kind of thing.  But it's already helping me. 
The other  day, as I was working with a friend on one of his projects, I
noticed that  my fingers were subconsciously falling onto the right keys
for a change."
<p>
    But why start studying piano now, in this day and age of rapid-fire 
sequencers?  Lee shrugs and laughs.  "Maybe it's a reaction to appearing
in  too many <strong>Keyboard</strong> polls."
