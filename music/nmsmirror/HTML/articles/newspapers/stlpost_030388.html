<font size=+1>Rush captivates crowd with sight-sound collage</font><br>
<b>by David Surkamp</b><p>

THE Canadian progressive rock trio Rush, performing at The Arena on
Tuesday evening, transcended the basic power-trio format with a
collage of lyrical and sonic textures and the use of fast-moving film
images that delighted spellbound fans. <p>

Rush opened its show with the locomotive power of "Big Money,"
displaying all the bombast and energy that has made the band a St.
Louis favorite for almost two decades. The musicians effortlessly
blended the raw power of a classic rock trio with the techno-drama of
the modern musical hardware at its disposal. <p>

The group's focal point, Geddy Lee, is a triple threat with his high-
pitched vocals, contrapuntal basslines and orchestrated synthesizer
style. A vastly underrated performer, Lee carves out his own personal
signature in every musical arrangement. <p>

Drummer Neil Peart has to be one of the hardest working drummers in
rock music today. His use of polyrythms is an elegantly imaginative
way to drive the band and frees him from resorting to the usual
hackneyed shuffles. Also, his clever utilization of digital samples during
his drum solo was a highlight of the program. <p>

The chiming chordal style of Alex Lifeson has begun to take on a life of
its own in some of the band's latest material. While Lifeson is more
than capable of fleet-fingered fretboard excursions, it is his ringing
rhythms that hold the material together against the shifting pulse the
three create together. <p>

While the audience gave the most vocal support to the band's
best-known material, such as "Tom Sawyer," the latest batch of songs
from "Hold Your Fire" seem to hold the most musical suprises for the
devoted following. Best among them was a powerful reading of
"Mission" that was all the more effective with the trio's choice of film
projections and laser stunts. <p>

Former Styx guitarist Tommy Shaw opened the program with an
all-too-brief set of his hard-pop material, and his latest material, such as
"Dangerous Game," was an unexpected pleasure. While he leaned a
little too heavily on his work with Styx, his new songs bode well for
the future of this talented singer-guitarist. <p>
