This is one of a few CD bootlegs from the Power Windows tour. Unfortunately, 
it's not really worth getting, unless you just like to have boots on CD. For one
thing, it's only a single cd, not the full concert. For another, the sound is
not spectacular. In fact, it's hard to hear the guitar for most of the show,
and the sound is very heavy on the bass.<p>

In several places you can hear fans talking during the songs, and the cd
itself is faded in and out during crowd noise where the splicing took place.
The song selection isn't bad though, concentrating on the MP - PoW era.
Another plus is that Geddy seems unusually talkative during this concert.<p>

The booklet is a 2-piece folded in half, with several pictures from around
1986 of the band. Nothing too great, but at least they have the right year.
And amazingly enough, the song listing on the back is complete and
almost accurate, listing "Middletown Dreams" instead as "Middletown
Dreamers".<p>

The recommendation for this boot is to get it in a tape trade if you want it, 
unless you MUST have it on cd.<p>
