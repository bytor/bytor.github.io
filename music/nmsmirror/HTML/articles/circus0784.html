Barring the band's riotous five-night stint at New York's Radio City
Music Hall last November, Canada's spirit of the radio, Rush, has
been off stage and off the air. Since August of '83 a heated internal
struggle to find a new producer was keeping Rush out of the
limelight. But now that Peter Henderson has replaced Terry Brown and
things have stabilized in Rush's north-woods camp, the group is
streaking up the charts with <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> (Mercury) and has
hit the road with a show guaranteed to re-establish the band as one
of the biggest noises in rock.<p>

"Times are hard out there," insists puckish Alex Lifeson. "We
want to put on the best show we can and keep ticket prices
reasonable. That's not to say that we've skimped on the show
one bit!"<p>

The first leg of Rush's tour will end in Indianapolis on the
16th of this month, at which point the band members will take
a six- to eight- week summer vacation with their families.
Just two and a half months on the road -- and then a major
break. A far cry, to be sure, from days gone by when lead
singer Geddy Lee gauged the band's accomplishment by the fact
that "we <strong>could</strong> go out on the road for eight months and do
exactly what we wanted to do." What gives? Is Rush promoting
a new image of the hard-rocker as a mellowed, responsible
family man? Not entirely so, according to original member Lee.<p>

"To stay on the road for six, eight months solid would kill
all the excitement for us," says Geddy (the
multi-instrumentalist), "because we have kids back home and
they're growing up. For us to keep doing this as long as we
can, it always has to be fun. That's why we make sure we get
home and have enough time there, so that when we do come back
on the road to play a show, we really want to play."<p>

Nevertheless, with tickets for this tour being scooped up in
record time, the band will hit the road again in September
and tour straight through until Christmas time -- with Japan
as a target for October. Known for fantastic visual effects,
Rush will be combining a magnificent laser show along with
their usual amazing lighting system and rear-screen
projection segments. But the true highlight of this year's
concerts will be a performance of drummer/lyricist Neil
Peart's haunting <strong>Fear</strong> trilogy ("Witch Hunt," "The Weapon" and
"The Enemy Within").<p>

For Rush, the time between <strong>Signals</strong> (1982) and <strong>Grace Under
Pressure</strong> was ill-spent. Just as Alex, Geddy and Neil relish
their privacy, they have also been known to covet stability
within their ranks -- remaining with the same manager (Ray
Daniels) and the same producer (Terry Brown) for 10 albums.
Slipping into the producer's chair for their new record,
however, was Peter Henderson. Henderson established himself
as a top-notch producer by giving Supertramp a sound that
brought tears of joy to the public's eye, and dollar signs to
everyone else's.<p>

"I guess we got to a point where we knew each other too well
and there was no mystery left," claims Lifeson. "We all knew
how Terry worked and Terry knew how we worked and everything
just became too stable. We wanted to shake things up a bit."<p>

If the shake-up over producers was a major problem for Rush over the
last year, the lyrics from new song "Kid Gloves" seem to indicate
that this might not be the whole story.<p>
<blockquote>

<em>
Call it blind frustration/Call it blind man's bluff,/Call
each other names/Your voice's rude -- your voice's
rough./Anger got bare knuckles/Reverse the golden rule,/Then
you learn the lesson/That it's tough to be so cool.</em><p>
</blockquote>

Could there have been some unpublicized fisticuffs among the
trio? With the tight rein that the band keeps over its
private life, outsiders will never know for sure.<p>

"1983 <strong>was</strong> tough year for us." says Lifeson. "The last
tour was a grind, and everybody has been going through some changes.
Before Peter, we had a couple of other people in mind we wanted to
work with, but things got screwed up along the way and there was a
bit of a panic. 'Kid Gloves' is our response to rolling with the
punches during pressure."<p>

Thankfully, when Rush emerged from their cocoon of despair
this year it was not with an LP so aptly titled <strong>1984</strong>, or a
concept piece from some California band that wouldn't know a
George Orwell concept if it jumped out of a bottle of Jack
Daniels.<p>

Work on <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> actually began last August,
though the LP didn't disturb the dust of record bins until
April. Nine months is the longest time Rush has ever spent
incubating a new album. Fortunately for the members of Rush,
however, their internal problems sparked a fire of
overwhelming creativity<p>

<a href="../../GIF/circus_jul84/circus84-4.gif" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/GIF/circus_jul84/circus84-4.gif">

"Guitar-wise," explains Lifeson, "I think the way things are
on <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> is a bit of a reaction to 
<strong>Signals</strong>.
Looking back to <strong>Signals</strong>, I think the guitar might have
suffered a bit; it was lower and smaller in perspective to
the rest of the mix. On the new album we went for more of an
aggressive sound, a fuller sort of production where all of
the instruments have more of a cohesive balance."<p>

The lyrical content of <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> sees Neil Peart
maturing as well. No futuristic space musicals here, for
Peart, weaned on Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy and John Dos
Passos, is slowly losing his penchant for writing
technological nightmare sequences. "Words are such an
infinite playground," says Peart, "and this style of writing
has bolstered my confidence with them and my understanding of
different ways of playing with them. It's just like the
technique of playing the drums." Sure, there are odes to
nuclear war and androids on the run, but also on the LP is a
razor-edged poem ("Afterimage") about a friend killed in a
car accident, and a chilling account ("Red Sector A") of life
in concentration camps.<p>

New rock bands and the recycled styles they claim to introduce come
and go as fleetingly as Baskin Robbins' flavor-of-the-month. So, it
would seem, do decades. It was exactly 10 years ago that Canada's
blond-haired and blue-eyed Alex Lifeson, with Geddy Lee and John
Rutsey, released the first Rush album on their own Moon Records
label.<p>

<a href="../../GIF/circus_jul84/circus84-5.gif" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/GIF/circus_jul84/circus84-5.gif">

The accolades and accusations have run their course, as they
do in the case of any long-lived band. Since high-school
chums Lifeson and Lee got together in Toronto-area garages in
1969, Rush has garnered numerous gold and platinum albums,
record-breaking sell-out performances and a Grammy nomination.
But the band has paid the price of fame and fortune.
Accusations against it have ranged from critics fingering
Rush as an anachronism of the late-'60s, to claims that Neil
Peart's Ayn Rand-based lyrics promote neo-fascism and
right-wing extremism. None of this has anything to do,
though, with the most important part of Rush the music.
"Image is not really important," contends Lee. "If there is
an image for this band, it comes strictly from the music."<p>

Rush's 10-year career has not been entirely a matter of
taking well-earned bows and tripping happily off to the local
savings and loan association. Geddy Lee can remember the
early days when Canadian music-moguls weren't buying what
Rush were pushing. He also remembers being fired from local
clubs because the band was playing so loud that barmaids
couldn't hear the beer orders. Things did get a
little better, though, once Mercury decided to release the 
<strong>Rush</strong>
album in America, and Lifeson recalls being roundly booed offstage
only once. "That was in Baltimore many years ago," says the cherubic
axeman. "We played a show with Sha Na Na. It was like a greaseball
dress-up masquerade dance, and it bordered on horribleness. They
didn't like us at all." But in 1984, the collective known as Rush
has emerged as a survivor.<p>

"[Rock music] all sounds the same now," Lee laments. At one
point it all came charging back and had a lot of energy, but
it really hasn't gone anywhere. It's just become a commercial
thing, all pasteurized and homogenized." By contrast, Rush's
"Tom Sawyer" and "Red Sector A" show the diversity of a band
that cares, but sells anyway.<P>

"I think if you love what you do -- and I do -- the more
successful you become," concludes Lee. "And the more
successful you become, the more freedom and flexibility you
have. .That's good; that's satisfying. But I'll admit that
there's a lot more hard work involved in becoming successful
than I ever realized when I was starting out!"<p>
