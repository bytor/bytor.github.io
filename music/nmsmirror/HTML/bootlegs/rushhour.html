This CD is a mostly a copy of "Rush N Roulette '92", with a few songs from one
of the numerous Grace Under Pressure video soundtracks.
It may or may not (depending on what you like in a boot) be something of
interest. Some prefer whole shows, some don't care as long as it sounds good.
<p>

The sound quality is excellent, probably direct from the soundboard and/or
radio broadcast, but occasionally the bass gets lost in the mix.
Tracks 1-7 rate a 9, 8-9 a 10, 10-14 a 9, and 15-16 an 8. The breaks are
evident between 2 & 3, 7 & 8, 9 & 10, and 14 & 15. There are also more subtle
chops between the end of YYZ and the start of Temples, and between
Subdivisions and The Pass, although you couldn't hear them unless listening
for them.<p>

A polar bear is on the cover as well as the CD itself. What does a polar bear
have to do with Rush? I have no idea. The booklet contains a very long essay:
it's a history of the band, but it's in German. It only has one picture in it
of Geddy. One nice thing is that the case itself has the title of the CD; of
course, if you break the case, you're out of luck getting a replacement!<p>

A nice CD overall with a good mix of older and newer tracks. Worth it if you
like compilation-type cds.<p>
