This is one great show! It is taken from the Permanent Waves tour; up until
now, only the St. Louis show has been available on CD (which of course, isn't
even the whole show). But on this one, you get pretty much the complete show!<p>

The sound quality isn't as good as the St. Louis boots; it's definitely an
audience tape from all the cheering and yelling, but thankfully has no TALKING
during the show. But all the instruments for the most part come through
clearly. At one point during "In The Mood" it becomes muffled, like the 
recorder was covered up. It only lasts a minute or two though. You can, 
however, hear slight tape hiss throughout the recording, and the high end is
a bit clipped.<p>

Just listen to Alex wail on "2112", or the awesome reggae intro to "Working
Man" (I wish it was extended)! The singing on "2112" is also something to 
hear -- from the AUDIENCE! And where else can you get the echo from 
"Cygnus X-1".<p>

There is a break between "The Spirit of Radio" and "Natural Science", probably
a tape flip, and the end of "Beneath, Between & Behind" is cut (probably for
the same reason). "Jacob's Ladder", however, is complete.<p>

The packaging is completely inappropriate, with tarot cards inside the cd's
fold-out and on the back cover. The front cover looks like a museum statue
piece. The songs are all listed correctly, but the packaging only lists
"Working Man" when really it's a medley of four songs.<p>

I highly recommend this cd. The show has been traded for years, and it's
great to have it on cd! There are some great song interchanges, and Alex's
little spanish intro to "The Trees" make you overlook its few faults.<p>
