<font size=+3>Hog Gears</font><br>
by Mike Sweger<br>
<em>September 9, 1997</em>
<p>
In a hog's case<br>
A gear is only made for fashion<br>
And all too soon a Harley<br>
Will be hauling bikers 'round the nation<p>

It seems to me<br>
As we ride our motorcycles through the storm<br>
Harley got it backwards<br>
When they traded function for pure form<p>

Hog gears -- It's the reason some are dead<br>
Hog gears -- With every unprotected head<p>

In the old days<br>
Leather looked quite serious<br>
Cow skin saves your ass<br>
But with no helmet it's mysterious<p>

It seems to me<br>
While it's fine that every Hog will shine with pride<br>
When all the chrome is polished<br>
There is barely time to go outside and ride<p>

Hog gears -- It's two wheels with lots of chrome<br>
Hog gears -- With every scratch they shed some tears<br>
Hog gears -- For every sad fool walking home<br>
Hog gears -- With empty space between his ears<p>

I'd rather ride a Beemer from Bavaria<br>
Or a bright red Ducatti anytime<br>
Than be dealing with these hog gears<p>

In a hog's chain<br>
A constant need for high-level maintenance<br>
One stop at the gas pump<br>
And the rider must have great patience<p>

It seems to me<br>
As they cruise those noisy cycles down the line<br>
They've lost their senses<br>
For a lower-level retro design<p>
</body>
