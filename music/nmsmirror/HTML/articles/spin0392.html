<em> [ Taken from <b>Spin</b>  --  March 1992 ]</em><p>

Rush?<p>

Yes, Rush.  Not the movie or the B.A.D. II song.  Certainly not "Rush Rush"
by Paula Abdul or "Rush Street" by Richard Marx.  And not even Frank Marino
and Mahogany Rush.  Just plain ol' eternally unfashionable,
the-guy-with-a-high-voice-singing-scary-songs Rush.<p>

So what in God's name is it doing in SPIN, a publication nominally devoted to
alternative music?  Well, I could go on about how Rush really <b>is</b> an
alternative for lots of suburban loners, at least in the context of
classic-rock overkill.  About how it is the ultimate punk band for people who
thought punk was bogus.  But basically the bottom line is this:  Even though
you may think Rush is uncool, it's influenced a lot of the bands and artists
that you probably think <b>are</b> cool.<p>

Not the old fogies like Randy Newman, Nick Lowe, and Billy Joel (who
apologized to Geddy Lee for missing the band's L.A. shows a few years ago).
 And not the cheeseball metal dudes like Queensryche who, for example, now
employ Rush's former producer, lighting director, and video director.  We're
talking about some of the more critically praised and commercially successful
groups of our era.<p>

It all started a couple of years ago at the same L.A. shows that Billy Joel
missed.  Vernon Reid of Living Colour told Neil Peart that Rush had shown him
that "a band could make it the way they wanted to."  Peart was profoundly
flattered because, he recalls, "I was so worried five years ago that we
wouldn't leave any mark, that it was all for nothing."<p>

Pretty soon anybody who played smart hard rock was being compared to the
Canadian power trio:  Metallica, Voivod, King's X, Faith No More, Jane's
Addiction, Fishbone, Primus (Rush's current opening act), and even Guns N'
Roses.  Hip cartoonists Los Bros Hernandez created a kid drummer in <b>Love And
Rockets</b> who wore a NEIL PEART IS RAD T-shirt; alt-rock goddess Kim Deal of
the Pixies often wears <b>her</b> Rush tour T-shirt on stage.  Flea of the Red Hot
Chili Peppers even got his start in a band called Anthym (probably taking its
"y" from the first name of Ayn Rand, individualist author of <b>Anthem</b>, which
became the title of a 1974 Rush song).<p>

While it's almost understandable that fellow musicians have come to give
drummer-lyricist Peart, bassist-vocalist-keyboardist Lee, and guitarist Alex
Lifeson their due, it's nothing short of a miracle that the critics are
starting to come around, too.  When I wrote my first defense of Rush for
<b>Village Voice</b> in 1985, I was responding to colleague Chuck Eddy's slurs on
the band.  By the decade's end, Eddy had come around, calling it "the secret
rock critic influence of 1989-90" and adding Sinead O'Connor, Midnight Oil,
and Megadeth to the list of disciples.<p>

And yet, if 1991 was the year that Rush returned with an album, <b>Roll The
Bones</b>, that entered the <b>Billboard</b> chart at No.3, tour dates that sold out
during a depression, and an updated sound that included a rap that wasn't
half as goofy as Michael Jackson's or Michael Stipe's, I still couldn't help
feeling a bit ambivalent . . .<p>

"Neil, I hope you realize that your face is dangerously close to a pair of
Damn Yankees promotional panties," I say.<p>

Neil Peart, who is sitting in my sparsely-furnished apartment, laughs and
launches into a good-natured anecdote about the band.  In addition to
ambivalence, I feel guilty about how lucky I am to have the lanky drummer
over to my pad.  Rush fanatics would give their eyeteeth to me in my sitch,
and there I was trying to play it cool.  It is the night off between the
band's two shows at Madison Square Garden last December.  Nursing a cold,
Peart is nonetheless in good humor, especially while imitating a typical
girlfriend at a Rush show.  "Sometimes, you see this [<b>exaggeratedly feigns
sleep</b>].  Sometimes this [<b>tugs on sleeve</b>].  But the other day Geddy and I
saw this one girl literally hitting this guy."<p>

With this in mind, I take the cutest young intern I can find at our office to
the next night's show.  She enjoys but doesn't love it and is amazed at how
"well-behaved" the audience is.  She is, however, impressed by how "real"
Peart is when we meet him backstage.  The only celebs present are John
McEnroe and Tatum O'Neil.  O'Neil says, "I really liked your drum solo" to
Peart, who smiles and mumbles some pleasantries while I whisper, "Excuse me,
but I've got to go call the gossip columnist at the <b>New York Post</b>."  He
hits me.<p>

After spending the entire day in his hotel room reading the Sunday <b>Times</b>,
Peart orders two glasses of dry sherry, tells me how he's practicing to
records recorded by a Brazillian drummer named Milton Banana these days, and
puts on Maceo Parker's 11-minute instrumental version of "It's A Man's
World", retitled "Children's World."<p>

Peart is seen as the ogre of the group, and granted, Lifeson (his pastimes
are golfing and Pearl Jam) and Lee (rotisserie baseball and Nat "King" Cole)
are far less intense; but it's Peart who wanted to do the rap, and who is
able to drop trendy names, like Massive Attack into the conversation.  Even
so, he's <b>still</b> Neil Peart, whose rugged individualism makes Metallica's
James Hetfield seem like a Commie in comparison.<p>

I had set out to really grill the guy, but from the outset he takes control
of the conversation.  First he lays down the premises:  Peart believes in
"standards of quality" and "progress, though not linear"; for the most part,
"there are no failures of talent, only failures of character"; it's also true
that "first we must acquire the virtues and then eliminate the vices."  He
then quotes Duke Ellington's dictum that "there are only two types of
music -- good and bad."<p>

Eventually, though, we get more specific.  Talking about the situation in
Eastern Europe, the man who wrote "Free Will" concedes, "If I had been born
in Bulgaria, no matter how much free will I'd have wished to apply, it
would've been worthless."  It is this hopelessness, which Peart also finds in
the AIDS situation, that fills him with enormous resentment.  "My response is
always anger.  It's so gratuitous.  There's no reason, no fault, no blame."<p>

I wondered if this cosmic capriciousness frustrated his white, Western, male,
middle-class, and middle-brow nature.  "The basic questions I ask in <b>Roll
The Bones</b> --  'Why are we here?'  'Why does it happen?' -- are the wrong
questions.  It's 'What can we do about it?'"<p>

The Maceo jam climaxes, and I tell Peart that when I saw the sax master
recently in concert he said that funk was "happy music."  In those terms,
where does he see Rush's music fitting in?<p>

"At it's best, it's inspiring.  Who's that guy in Seattle that pitched a
no-hitter?  He'd played his drums that day and when he was out there
pitching, he was thinking of Rush songs.   When I was writing 'The Pass' [a
1989 song about teen suicide], some kids told me that people who are truly
suicidal listen to Pink Floyd.  Rush is seen as hopeful music."<p>

For the many who see Rush's music as hope<b>less</b>, the pyrotechnic sticksman
has a surprising tolerance.  "It's fine for people to say they hate us -- our
music is too busy, too self-absorbed elevated.  Or they hate Geddy's voice.
 Fine.  That's a taste thing."<p>

Actually, it's more than a taste thing.  After all, as the Duke would ask,
"Is it good or is it bad?"  At this point, Peart stops backpedaling and
defends his honor.  "Rhythm is the basis of a lot of musical styles.  To
Rush, it's just an element.  That's why we're accused of being too busy, too
convoluted, too far-reaching.  Yes, we're restless, and yes, our work is
uneven -- but no one can ever question the sincerity of the attempt."<p>

No one was questioning the sincerity of the attempt, at least not in this
room.  I just wanted to know if Rush's '70s-style eclecticism was still
relevant.  Back in high school, it certainly had been.  With its mix of power
pop, barroom piano, and mock reggae, "The Spirit Of Radio" had been the
prefect antidote to the skinny-tie ska geeks and anemic new wavers.  But is
the funk, folk, and rap of "Roll The Bones" just as effective in 1992?
 Peart, unflappable as ever, is free of doubt.<p>

"'The Spirit Of Radio' is a valid musical gumbo, even now.  The concept was
to combine styles in a radical way to represent what radio should be.  I
think we really nailed that with 'Roll The Bones' as well.  And it's
happening on the fringe of pop music -- like Faith No More.  They're not afraid
to head off in a strange direction within a song.  But it's still
unacceptable in the mainstream.  There's this strange intolerance among music
fans."<p>

Valid musical gumbo?  I'd still buy that for a dollar.<p>
