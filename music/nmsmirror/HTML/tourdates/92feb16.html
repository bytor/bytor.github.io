<h3>Precision thunder
<dt>Relentless Rush gives pure show of strength</h3>

As power-fusion trio Rush proved at Reunion Arena on Sunday night,
"enormo-dome rock" is to be praised for its excesses and forgiven its lack of
subtlety and finesse.
<p>
Coffeehouses were created for sensible lyrics and heartfelt sentiments, but
when you've got 15,000 fans ready to blow off some steam, it's time to haul
out the lasers and power chords. The idea is to give the kids a show -- and
for just more than two hours, the biggest little band in the business slung
its brand of cyber-rock far and wide. They often backed their precise thunder
with a huge, ambitious video screen then exploded out of each song with
relentless Cecil B. DeMille endings. At one point, near the end of the show,
the veteran Canadian band launched into "Superconductor," with the screen
showing footage of Marily Monroe, Dean Martin, Elvis Presley and high-kicking
chorus girls. Suddenly, two 15-foot rabbits popped out of massive top hats at
both sides of the stage as bassist-vocalist Geddy Lee sang, "That's
entertainment!" No kidding.
<p>
Opening with "Force Ten," Rush made it clear from the onset that their
trademark sci-fi gibberish was going to be swept up in a tornado of basic
guitar, bass and drums. Although the band has been credited with bringing
smarts to metal ("heavy mental" music?), they've also brought along
intelligence's pesky friends, pretention and pomposity.
<p>
Sunday night, Rush played such cringe-inducing songs as "Xanadu" and "2112,"
but those numbers rocked pretty good in concert, even with their myriad rhythm
changes and grandiose flourishes. So hard and heavy was the accompaniment that
Geddy Lee's "search and annoy" voice didn't bother me the way it usually does.
Slight and bouncy, with wire-framed sunglasses riding his buffalo-nickle nose,
Mr. Lee resembled a cross between U2's Bono and Sonny Bono.
<p>
With scissor kicks accenting the most severe tempo shifts, Mr. Lee proved an
engaging focal point. Probably 70 to 80 percent of the audience was male, and
at least half of those were drummers or at least saving up for a kit. Geddy
Lee handled all the lead vocals, but much of the crowd came to see Neil Peart,
the headbanger's Buddy Rich. Mr. Peart also charts the band's futuristic bent
through his tiresome lyrics. But all is forgiven when you witness one of his
legendary drum solos.
<p>
I usually take to drum solos like a vegetarian to a rack of ribs, but Mr.
Peart's eight-minute turn in the spotlight was nothing short of amazing. He
started off playing vibes with his right hand and conga drums with his left to
weave a luscious texture, then stood up as his drums revolved to place a ready
snare at his knees. With poles of white light jitterbugging to his beat and
cymbal shots triggering synthesizer flashes, Mr. Peart found himself in the
middle of a glorious storm of light and sound.
<p>
Guitarist Alex Lifeson was the least-accomplished of the trio, relying on a
stride of effects in lieu of a style. But the songs that followed his furry
chords, including "Living In the Limelight" and "Time Stands Still," were the
best of the night.
<p>
Although they try to hide it among their impressive yet soulless stop-start
changes, Rush can be a richly melodic band. While Mr. Peart emulates a
supercharged octopus and Mr. Lee plays twice as many bass notes as necessary,
it's up to the band's lone non-virtuoso to remind the others that there are
irresistible hooks to be reeled in.
<p>
Rush claims that their main influence is author Ayn Rand, but they owe most of
their remarkable success to Rand McNally. Constant touring -- with first-rate
sound and effects -- is what has brought them platinum records and soldout
venues. On Sunday, they sounded like they know that.
<p>
Their latest LP, <u>Roll the Bones</u>, is a straightforward rock album
compared to such cosmic sludge as 1975's <u>Caress Of Steel</u>; and Rush's
concert reflected this new riff-friendly tact. Such tunes from the new album
as "Dreamline" and "Ghost of a Chance" found the band <u>not</u> aspiring to
be Return To Forever or some other horrible futuristic jazz band that they
seem to worship. The title track of the new album actually featured a rap
break. In concert, the segment was performed by an animated skull, while such
instruments of chance as dice and cards flashed all around.
<p>
When Rush left the stage after "Tom Sawyer," the call for more was tumultuous,
genuine. Yeah, they held up their lighters, but they meant it. The band
responded with its most fiery foray of the night, beginning and ending the
10-minute encore with "Spirit of Radio," throwing snippets of four or five
songs into the mix. Then Rush passed the final test of a good show: Dozens of
concertgoers clogged the exit by crowding around the merchandise table to buy
T-shirts.
<p>
Opening act, Primus, received an impressive response to their half-hour set of
psychedelic swamp-funk numbers.
