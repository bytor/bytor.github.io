<font size=+1>Fans here get the same Rush that they got 22 years ago</font><br>

        More than 22 years after first playing the Civic Arena, the
Canadian power trio Rush played a searing three-hour set last night that
served as a killer career retrospective.<p>
        "It was right here, on August 16, 1974, that we played our first
American date," singer/basssist Geddy Lee told the crowd, adding that the
band had played Pittsburgh more than any other U.S. city. "The only
difference between then and now is that tonite we're going to play a lot
longer."<p>
        Judging from the mix of ages in the crowd, some were in their 30's
when they discovered Rush's live show that night in '74. Others were still
having their diapers changed every two hours.<p>
        That passage of time prompted more than a few self-depreciating
age jokes from singer Geddy Lee, but the band tempered the nostalgia by
playing a half-dozen songs from its 2-month-old disc, "Test for Echo."
Those songs showed that the band's vitality hadn't waned through 20
releases.<p>
        Another interesting thing about crowds at Rush concerts is that
more than the obligitory air guitarists, these fans boast a number of air
drummers and air bassists, and Lee and drummer Neil Peart showed why their
playing draws such fanatic fascination.<p>
        Lee, in particular, was dazzling all night on bass, no more so
than on a solo midway through the band's anthem, "Closer to the Heart."<p>
        Peart again proved himself a master of the drum cage, making use
of every piece crowded around him on his carousel mini-stage. Shortly
after intermission, he launched into an eight-minute solo at the end of
the instrumental "Where's My Thing" that produced many pretenders in the
crowd -- and many cheers of appreciation.<p>
        Rush's music -- a complex mix of rhythms that sometimes take their
time interlocking into a foot-stomping melody -- has always been more
arena-friendly than radio-friendly, in part because seeing Lee, Peart, and
guitarist Alex Lifeson at work makes you appreciate the music's intracy
all the more.<p>
        The first half of the showhad favorites like "The Big Money," The
Trees," "Red Barchetta" and a much appreciated rarity from the band, the
entire space opera "2112," an album-side-long Rush classic that has been
truncated because of concert time constraints over the years. After
intermission -- a "Geritol" break, Lee quipped -- the band had the crowd on
its feet with favorites like "Freewill," "The Spirit of the Radio" and
"Tom Sawyer."<p>
        While even a three-hour show can't fulfill all of the requests for
a rabid Rush fan -- there was, remember, a new disc to sell -- the band
truly aimed to keep its faithfull customers happy. And with Lee in full
voice and the band at peak stride, few of the near-capacity crowd went
away dissatisfied.
