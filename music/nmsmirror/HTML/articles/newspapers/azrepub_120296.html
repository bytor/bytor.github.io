<font size=+1>RUSH, Rush, rush echoes its raw power</font><br>
<b>by Larry Rodgers</b><p>

        In its first tour in more than 2 years, rock power-trio Rush is
taking to heart the title of its new album, Test For Echo.<p>

        The signal came back loud and clear from an appreciative audience
Friday at the America West Arena as the Canadian band dished out an array of
tunes from its latest effort, as well as hits from 20-plus years.<p>

        The 1996 version of Rush sports a stripped-down sound, with
vocalist-bassist Geddy Lee turning less to the synthesizer than in the past.
This allows more room for fun-loving guitar maestro Alex Lifeson and
superdrummer Neil Peart to shine.<p>

        After a rousing version of past hit The Big Money early on, Rush
settled into an electrifying first set featuring songs from Test for Echo,
including the driving Driven and Limbo, in which Lifeson unleashed some
savage licks. Half the world was played against an innovative video, as were
most other songs.<p>

        Later in the three-hour show, the band hedged its bets with older
favorites, including a soaring Freewill, as well as the obligatory Tom
Sawyer and Closer to the Heart.<p>

When Rush hits on all cylinders, as it did most of the night, you'd have to
go back to the days of Cream to find a rock trio that delivered as much
power onstage.<p>
