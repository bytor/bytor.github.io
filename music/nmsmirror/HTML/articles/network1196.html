<strong>Network</strong> -- November 1996</font><p>
"Rush returns to guitar roots for aggressive new album"<br>
<strong>
by Perry Stern
</strong><p>

After 22 years, some two dozen releases and sales of over 35 million
albums worldwide, "fresh" is just about the last word you'd expect applied
to Rush circa 1996. After a summer that saw revivals of Kiss, Styx and
Cheap Trick to mixed reviews -- all of them Rush's contemporaries and
competition in the mid-'70s -- the release of Test For Echo, the group's
20th studio album, might reasonably be dismissed as just more fodder for
their diehard fans. But, no. Still challenging themselves with new goals,
new techniques, new personnel and rerenewed enthusiasm, Geddy Lee, Alex
Lifeson and Neil Peart have grown something fresh and unexpected from one
of the longest-blooming perennials in rock's often fallow garden. And they
seem almost as surprised as the rest of us.<p>

"I look at this band as a work in progress," Lee explains thoughtfully
over a mushroom salad and cranberry juice in an all-but-deserted bistro
near the band's downtown Toronto office. "That's why going into each
project is so exciting for us... we don't know what's going to come out
the other end. We want to keep challenging ourselves as an experiment and
also to present ourselves in a slightly different way, continuing the
evolution."<p>

But Test For Echo is more of a de-evolution of the often dense, layered
and intricate music Rush has made in the past. Using fewer keyboards then
ever before, the album's energy recalls the group's halcyon days as a pure
power trio of guitar-bass-drums, but two decades worth of songwriting and
concert performances have elevated the level of musicianship so high that the 
group no longer feels the need to pack every empty space with as many guitar 
licks, bass riffs and drum fills as (in) humanly possible.<p>

"I like being thought of as 'progressive,'" Lee elaborates, "even if it is
a dinosaur term. It's the only term that seems to make sense. I don't like
sounding dated. I'm not interested in being nostalgic or to revisit the
past. I don't want to be appreciated just for something I did 20 or 15
years ago. There are all these bands coming back on the road now -- Styx,
Kiss -- and we're still here. I like to think that we're still trying to
be part of what's going on."<p>

Of course, being a part of "what's going on" means keeping up, constantly
changing, or at least reconsidering certain musical and thematic
decisions. "That's why so much of our music over the years has not pleased
the Rush fan all the time," he explains. "You can't stay on one track --
the track the public expects of you for too long without hearing [something 
new and different] and saying, 'that's cool. Let's go there and see if that 
turns into anything.' And you go there, write a song, put it on your record, 
put the record out quickly before you give yourself a chance to second guess 
yourself too much..." he says, breathlessly, then bursts into a wide grin 
before concluding, "And then you see it and say, 'You know what? You were 
really bad at that.' It may have been fun to do, but you understand why the 
fans wouldn't like that song. It becomes a half-assed attempt to do 
something different."<p>

All three members brought something new to the project that none of the
others really expected. Peart had spent the down time between Rush records
working on a series of Buddy Rich tribute albums and found a new teacher
who completely revamped his playing style. According to Lee, Peart has 
changed, "everything -- the way he holds his sticks, the way he sets up his 
drums... now there's a different tonality to the way he plays. The way his 
snare drum speaks is far more musical now. You can notice it in the sound 
of the snare on this record," he says, working himself up into a frenzy of 
muso enthusiasm.  Then he catches himself and adds, almost apologetically, 
"if you're so inclined to look for these things."<p>

Lifeson recorded his first solo album, Victor, and, as a result, came into
the studio primed and pumped instead of merely relaxed and rested. "I
can't be objective," Lee confesses, when asked for a review of Victor,
then diplomatically offers that the effort took "guts." Coming out of the
benign dictatorship that making a solo record can be (you get to make all
the decisions yourself) and back into the democracy of Rush meant an
inevitable, but brief, awkward moment. "You just have to put us together
and let us talk, and by the second day we were having a great time again,"
explains Lee.<p>

And Lee, whose newly born daughter was the reason the group took an extra
year off between albums, came back ready to rock. "I did very little music
during the time off," he explains. "I was fed up to here with it," he says
with a hand slashing viciously at his throat. But, he adds sheepishly, "I
missed it a lot after about a year. On the road I really miss the domestic
scene, so when I get off the road I really ignore music. I wasn't exactly
in the John Lennon-bake-bread-at-home-stage, but I spent a lot of time with
both my children."<p>

At a time when Rush has been around for longer than many contemporary
musicians have been alive, it's hardly surprising that so many current
bands cite the trio as an early influence. What is a bit of a revelation
is that now Rush is taking cues from the bands they themselves inspired.
That's what led to what Lee tentatively describes as their most "American"
sounding album to date.<p>

"We got a drier, more American sound at the get-go, but as the record
progressed we found ourselves overloading the tracks with too many
guitars, too many this, too many that. We were getting quite dense again
and we were actually worried because we were trying to do something
different. That's the point where we made the decision to bring in Andy
Wallace to mix it," explains Lee. Wallace, who'd mixed for Sonic Youth, 
Rage Against The Machine, Bad Religion and Alice In Chains, found a way 
to apply the phrase "less is more" to Rush for the first time.<p>

Lee concedes that trends in the alternative music scene have had an impact
on Rush, but not in an obvious way. "People say you've got to be more
alternative these days, but what does that mean?" he asks angrily. "If
anything it makes me want to sound more like us. You can tell when some
band is trying to jump on the alternative bandwagon. Instead of taking
that tack I want to learn from what's going on.<p>

"I may have influenced them in their early, formative years but now
they're in a way different space than we are and have something to teach
me." And who are these influences? "A couple of years ago I would have
cited the Chilli Peppers," Lee offers, "because there was a funky and hard
edge to what they were doing. When Soundgarden first came on the scene I
liked that kind of unbridled fury that was in their music. And I have a
great appreciation for the economical songwriting of the Smashing
Pumpkins. They inspire you to have another go at it from a different point
of view."<p>

But while no one ever used terms like "funky," "unbridled fury" and
"economical songwriting" while describing Rush's music, it's easy to hear
how today's sounds inevitably effect the band. "That's why going into each
project is so exciting for us," Lee confesses. "We don't know what's going
to come out the other end."<p>
