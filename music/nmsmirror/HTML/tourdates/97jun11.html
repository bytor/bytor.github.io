Rush is in no hurry to fade from limelight</font><br>
<strong>by John Young</strong><p>

It's the curse of the young according to Rush.  Opening its Star
Lake Ampitheater show last night with "Dreamline", the Canadian trio offered
a melodic lyrical paradox.  "We're only immortal" sang bassist Geddy Lee,
"for a limited time."<p>

The same could be said for most rock bands, but somehow Rush remains
evergreen.  And it's not just its instrumental virtuosity that keeps
concertgoers, like the 11,088 in attendence last night, coming back.  Lee,
guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart know that some catchy hooks and
melodies had better accompany the flowing time changes, fast fretwork and
technical wizardry.<p>

Much of the band's best-known art pop comes from its 70's and 80's
catalog, and Rush peppered its two sets with chestnuts.  The guitar harmonics
that introduce "Red Barchetta" immediately drew a roar of recognition from
the crowd, while "Limelight" inspired much head bobbing (about the closest
thing to dancing you'll witness at an event attended mostly by men aged 18 to
40).  An only slightly abridged run-through of the group's sci-fi fantasy
concept album "2112" had fans shouting "hey!" in time and clearly
anticipating, then relishing, the various turns of the story.<p>

Oddly enough, it's Rush's ability to pare down its extended musical
explorations that's kept it vital.  The rock radio hits continue to this day
in large part due to smart editing in service of the songs.  From the heavy
waltz "Driven" to the catchy tune "Half the World" to the
hold-your-lighter-aloft anthem "Nobody's Hero" Rush's recent material sounded
fresh and relevant.<p>

Part of what sells all the songs is the energy and enthusiasm with
which they are played.  And if all the allegorical stories about trees and
mythic cars and guitars seem a bit overwrought, the guys at least play them
while flashing good-natured, knowing smiles.  Well, Lifeson and Lee do,
anyway.  Peart, the band's principal lyricist, looked awfully serious about
living up to being rock's most widely acknowledged drummer's drummer, his
playing long on intricate fills and dramatically flipped sticks.  Lee and
Lifeson were more off-handed about their lightning runs and frequent, wisely
brief, solo turns, but no less accomplished in their instrumental feats.<p>

Given the group's longevity, Rush also took the right tack in
performing two extended sets and eschewing dragging along an opening act.
 Speaking to the crowd, Lee acknowledged that he believes that the band has
"played Pittsburgh more than any city in the universe," and joked that they
hoped to provide a representative sampling of "400,000 songs" or so.  It was
more like 25, which didn't leave room for staples like "The Spirit of the
Radio" and "Time Stand Still", but still managed to squeeze in "Freewill" 
"Closer to the Heart" and the obligatory "Tom Sawyer".<p>

The cynical may still dub Rush tech heads long on chops and short on
soul.  But plenty of great players come and go without making much of an
impression.  Rush may not be immortal, but its continued commercial viability
is a testament to the band's ingenuity, integrity, and spirit.<p>
