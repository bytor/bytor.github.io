<font size=+1>Veteran rockers Rush still have imagination</font><br>
<b>by Ralph Kisiel</b><p>

Not only can Rush still roll the bones, but the hard-rocking Canadian trio 
showed a Savage Hall audience Saturday night that they still can do it with 
intensity and imagination.<p>

"Being mature doesn't have to mean being dead," Rush drummer Neil Peart says. 
"You just have to get out there and rock, keep your bones rolling, and stay 
out of the ruts."<p>

So the trio named their latest and 18th album "Roll the Bones" and set out on 
a year-long concert tour. They clearly illustrated Saturday night that they 
can rock and rattle your bones for more than two hours.<p>

The 19-song set left their fans thoroughly satisfied, as they exhibited the 
precision, controlled power, and polish that only a veteran band can provide 
with such ease. The fan response was overwhelming as most in the boisterous 
crowd were on their feet for nearly the entire show.<p>

Rush used crowd favorites like "Limelight" and "Freewill" to whip up the 
audience's emotions quickly. But the band offered much more through the 
effective, often intriguing use of film clips cast on a huge screen behind 
them. As the house lights dimmed, the screen came to life with delightful 
Picasso-styled cartoon characters that represented the band members preparing 
for the show. Most songs were accompanied by film, hypnotic geometrical 
designs, or clever animation.<p>

"It's been quite a few years since we've been here in Toledo, so let's get 
right into it," said Geddy Lee, the band's singer, bass guitarist, and keyboard 
player. Although Rush is a trio, Lee really acts as the band's third and 
fourth musician, displaying his versatility by frequently switching between 
bass and synthesizer during the same song.<p>

None of the musicians really offered much in the way of between-song banter, 
but with all of the visual attractions, including stunning laser lights, 
friendly chatter really wasn't missed.<p>

During "Time Stand Still," the crowd was treated to a dizzying high-speed
ride over snow-capped mountains, through narrow tree-filled valleys, and
just feet above a twisting river. The rollicking trip was accomplished via 
an aerial movie projected at super speed.<p>

"Dreamline," "Roll the Bones," and "Bravado" were offered from the new album, 
with lead guitarist Alex Lifeson presenting a haunting, dreamy passage on 
"Bravado" - a highlight of the show.<p>

Lifeson's scorching guitar work on "Superconductor" was accompanied by two 
25-foot-tall inflatable rabbits slowly rising from gargantuan black hats 
on each side of the stage. While his guitar riffs crashed through the hall, 
the bunnies bounced merrily to the vicious beat.<p>

Rush's variety-packed show included "Closer to the Heart," "Tom Sawyer,"
"The Big Money," and "The Spirit of Radio."

<font size=+1>Relics Of The Seventies Rock Into The Nineties</font><br>
<b>by John F. Comes</b><p>

Three men from the Great White North visited Savage Hall Saturday and 
promptly blew the doors off the place.<p>

The Canadian trio Rush proved that it can still put on a crowd-pleasing 
show in the pop-infected nineties.<p>

Frontman Geddy Lee, bass, keyboards and vocals, wasted little time and 
energy with the fake crowd chatter and got down to the business at hand. 
Backed by Alex Lifeson, guitars, and Neil Peart, drums, Lee used his 
trademark vocal styling to keep the near-capacity crowd on its feet for most 
of the show.<p>

Kicking off with "Force Ten," Rush played most of its well-known cuts 
from its long career. Songs like "Limelight," "Subdivisions," and "Big 
Money" did not lose any of their studio polished feel, but instead became 
soaring tracks blending big bass and searing guitar riffs with incessant 
drumming to shake the crowd as well as the rafters.<p>

Peart, apparently unaffected by his wrist problem, stole the show with a
15-minute solo. In recent years, solos have become a boring break or 
outrageous bravado, as in Motley Crue's Tommy Lee's contrived solos. But 
Peart made his solo a highlight of the show by using a combination of 
chimes, electronic drum pads, cowbells, and huge floor toms and kettle drums 
to showcase his drum skills.<p>

Lifeson, who was restrained in comparison to other guitarists, blended 
perfectly with Lee and Peart to help power the Rush sound. This is not to 
say he was lifeless, but rather a precisely made gear in a well-oiled 
machine.<p>

When the show opened, it looked to be your run-of-the-mill concert, but 
as the musical frenzy grew, so did the stage and lighting. A huge screen 
behind the group bombarded the crowd with video clips and surreal images.
The light show picked up when laser lights and multiple light patterns 
danced across the hall. The stage opened up to unleash even more lighting.
Rush also brought along two huge inflatable rabbits from its "Presto" 
tour. The rabbits came to life during "Tom Sawyer" and caused the loudest 
crowd reaction of the night.<p>

Rush came into town and proved once again that good rock music does not 
age, it only gets better.
