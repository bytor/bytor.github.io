In the music business, like the animal kingdom, a process of natural selection
occurs that weeds out the old and tired while making room for the young and
strong. As a result, musicians have the shelf life of an open carton of milk
on a summer sidewalk in New Mexico. Rock is still such a relatively new art
form that we, the consumers, sit in stunned amazement as anniversaries roll by
(Woodstock was 25 years ago? No way!), heroes wither (Mick Jagger is 50? Get
outta town!) and embarrassing fads make a comeback (bellbottoms -- 'nuff said).
Because it's so geared to youth culture, rock has a tendency to discard
sounds, instruments, technology and people with the casual thoughtlessness of
a toddler and his toys.
<p>

In most artistic endeavors age is equated with growing, improving and wisdom.
In rock, aging equals dying. That's why Rush is beyond rock. As the most
enduring proponents of progressive rock, a field once crowded by now -- (or
ought-to-be-) defunct bands such as Yes, ELP, Genesis and Jethro Tull, it
should be easy to dismiss our homeboy power trio as a staggering dinosaur too
big and stupid to know it's among the walking wounded. But it's not. As the
band's peers fade to grey, Rush explodes into technicolor. Rush is the
metarocker of the future. It couldn't have happened any other way.

As far as the three members of Rush are concerned, it's not a new or improved
or even old Rush that surfaces on their (can you believe it?) 19th album,
<strong>Counterparts</strong>, but simply <strong>another</strong> Rush -- a Rush for the '90s. Harkening
back to an earlier, rock-oriented sound before the clutter of synthesizers and
drum machines, <strong>Counterparts</strong> reveals a lean, mean Rush that has come down to
earth after almost two decades worth of apocalyptic, epic compositions. Cynics
might charge that the band is conforming to the latest MTV-era fad of
"unplugging" its sound, although the words "acoustic" and "Rush" have yet to
(and still shouldn't) be uttered in the same sentence. The group hasn't
unplugged its guitars, just all those bloody keyboards. After years of
assembling musical monuments to technology, Rush has slipped back down the
evolutionary ladder a few rungs to make its most organic-sounding release to
date. 
<p>

Sniffing into his handkerchief, a little red-eyed and ravaged by a late summer
virus, bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee explains how the formerly distant, aloof
Rush turned warm and fuzzy. "We've been moving in this direction over the last
two or three records," he says, "slowly eliminating frills and trying to get a
more rooted, more hard-hitting, basic sound." After years of pushing the
outermost limits of the technological envelope, he asserts the new album is,
in fact, "anti-technology."
<p>

"We feel like we drowned in it and now we're coming up for air," says Lee.

As befits an album made by adults (Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson turned 40
this year, drummer/lyricist Neil Peart is 41) <strong>Counterparts</strong> reveals a side of
Rush that its members actively concealed for the better part of their career.
There are love songs on the album, not the band's first, but certainly its
most (oh, oh, here comes the "m" word) <strong>mature</strong>, most realistic love songs as
well its most accessible commentaries on basic human nature. "I've been more
comfortable with personal statements [and my] increasing ability to express
them in non-cliche ways," lyricist/drummer Peart rather clinically declares
over the phone from his home north of Toronto. "In 'Cold Fire' I have the
woman speaking to the man and she's smarter than he is. It was a difficult
technical challenge lyrically, but those are the kind of things that now,
after all these years, you start to feel you have the craft to take on. I
don't mind writing about love now, where I would have avoided that in the
previous years just because of the inability to get beyond cliches."
<p>

Although the band blossomed in the '70s (with classics like <strong>Fly By Night</strong>,
<strong>2112</strong> and <strong>Farewell To Kings</strong>) and flourished in the early '80s (<strong>Permanent
Waves</strong>, <strong>Signals</strong>) Peart says, "the mid-'80s were difficult because music was
moving so far away from our values. Musicianship suddenly didn't count. We had
no respect from the critics and everyone else considered us kind of
irrelevant." Everyone else but the loyal fan base that pretty well assured
them platinum-plus sales and sold out concerts around the world.
<p>

Rush suffered an image problem. Hobbled by the perception that it exclusively
wrote dungeons-and-dragons style epics or cyberpunk (before the word was
coined) fantasies for nerdy 17-year-old boys, Rush found itself at odds with
the way the music world classified it. "We were just as outside and
experimental and idiosyncratic as Japan, Peter Gabriel or Brian Eno," Peart
contends, almost defensively, "but certainly we never won that respect and
were never perceived as having those intentions." This was a band that could
have cleaned up selling pocket protectors along with its T-shirts at concerts.
<p>

But lately Rush can no longer claim to be the Rodnet Dangerfield of rock. If
the "respect" illustrated by ticket and record sales wasn't quite enough for
Lee, Peart and Lifeson, then two recent awards, given for vastly different
reasons and by vastly different organizations, have helped assuage their
moderately bruised egos. In early September the Arts Foundation of Greater
Toronto announced that Rush would receive the 1993 Toronto Arts Award for
Music for having brought "new standards to hard rock." Citing the band's sale
of 30 millino records and six million concert tickets (including a record 22
dates at Maple Leaf Gardens) as an aside, jury head Denise Donlon (Director of
Music Programming for Citytv/MuchMusic) says the award had more to do with the
"international acclaim they've brought to the city," as well as the
extraordinary generosity of their very "personal and very private" donations
to local charities. Over the years the band has raised over $1 million for the
United Way. "Beyond all the awards and statistics," the announcement stated,
"Rush's music continues to excite, challenge and entertain."

The other award came in May from out of left field. With tongues placed
partially in cheek, the members of the <strong>Harvard Lampoon</strong> (at 177 the world's
oldest humor magazine) declared Rush the Musicians of the Millennium. At a
black-tie reception in the mysterious Lampoon Mansion a secret ceremony was
held inducting the three as honorary members, a distinction shared by such
diverse luminaries as Winston Churchill, Bill Cosby, George Foreman and Robin
Williams. The award isn't exactly a back-handed compliment by a bunch of
elitists snickering behind their smiles at a band that takes itself too
seriously. Steve Lookner, a former member of the executive board that chose
Rush, explains, "They're very literate -- one of the few bands that actually
puts some humor into its lyrics and tries to make jokes once in a while. When
there's a band that tries to be funny in an industry which doesn't have a lot
of humor in it, we respect that."
<p>

"A sense of humor has kept the three of us together more than anything," Lee
contends. "People attach this sense of severe seriousness to everything we do,
but it's not like that. There's a lot of goofiness that goes into our material
that's described as heaviness, which is kinda funny. And I guess there is a
serious side to us, but it was a great relief to us to have the opportunity to
go to the <strong>Lampoon</strong> and for them to recognize a lot of these stupid things we
put in our songs. Here's this generation of young bright lights who will be
making their way into comic writing and positions of leadership in the future
and <strong>they got the jokes</strong>."
<p>

The "jokes" (as in older songs like "Superconductor" and "Red Lenses" that
poke fun at pop icons and political perceptions) are few and far between on
<strong>Counterparts</strong>, though. By shrinking the scope of his lyrics to personal
rather than universal problems, Peart has verbally paralleled the down-sizing
that Lee and Lifeson have accomplished sonically. But for both Lee and Peart
what appears to be a simplification is, in fact, some of the hardest work
they've done.
<p>

Where once it seemed all three players tried to fit as many notes or beats
into a song as (in)humanly possible, now there seems to be a refinement of
songwriting that resembles nothing less than conventional verse/chorus/verse
three-minute pop song structure. "I guess the common word is 'retro,'" Lee
says of <strong>Counterparts'</strong> sound, "but it's not, it's just simplified."
<p>

"That's the classic showbiz thing," Peart claims, "do a simple thing and make
it look hard or do something hard and make it look simple. One is
entertainment and the other is artistry."
<p>

"We've always written music to satisfy ourselves," Lee points out, "and we
cross our fingers that there are enough people of similar sensibility that
will appreciate our music. We don't have a target market, we just do what we
do. Enough of our audience has stuck around and there's been enough interest
among younger people that our audience is really 14 to 40. In some cities [the
audience] is real young, in some there's even people my age!" he laughs. "It's
pretty gratifying -- we've turned into what the Grateful Dead are, for our
kind of music. It's almost a cult thing."
<p>

But while Rush might be a "cult thing" elsewhere, it's about as close to a
musical institution in this country as anything on this side of Gordon
Lightfoot, Anne Murray and <strong>Don Messer's Jubilee</strong>. At one time the band might
have been a guilty pleasure or an embarrassing footnote in some snob's music
collection, but today Rush returns to the head of the class with a refined
sound that puts bands half its age to shame.
