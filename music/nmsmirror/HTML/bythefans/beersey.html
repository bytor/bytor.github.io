All around this great Beer World<br>
From the bottles to the cans<br>
People buy the brands they want<br>
And carryout with their own two hands<p>

But be careful not to buy too much<br>
Or you might drop a case<br>
Then all your beer will spill out<br>
O, what a big disgrace!<p>

All those wasted beers<br>
All those precious, wasted beers<br>
Who will pay?<p>

Do we have to mop the floor up at last?<br>
What else can we do?<br>
Do we have to say goodbye to our drafts?<br>
Yes, I guess we do<p>
