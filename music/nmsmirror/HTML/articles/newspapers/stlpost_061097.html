<font size=+1>With Solos And Lasers, The Rush Is On</font><br>
<b>by Michael Kuelker</b><p>

In the spirit of Rush, and as a throwback to the golden age of rock's
concept suites (which would be the 1970s), I am titling this review "Banshee 
Aria: Geddy's Monster Throb Descends Upon Maryland Heights." Or perhaps 
"Histrionica: Let the Solos Begin."<p>

Rush made its second pass on the "Test for Echo" tour, playing a long,
uproariously received concert here Sunday night.<p>

The trio, which has maintained its membership since 1974, hasn't lost a
beat. Geddy Lee plunked a Morse code of basslines, Neil Peart provided very 
busy end fills, and Alex Lifeson lent rhythmic heft. It was characteristic 
Rush.<p>

The Rush concept song of the '70s meant puzzles of music with esoteric
titles and was never long in turning into a guitar-hero, or bass-hero or 
drum-hero part. Today, Rush favors a tighter package, sometimes no less 
obscurely titled stuff but usually in the four- and five-minute range.  But as 
accepting as its audience is of the material the trio puts out roughly 
every two years, Rush knows it's the yowls from yore that spin the wheels of 
its concert caravan.<p>

The centerpiece of the show was "2112," the Ayn Rand-inspired opus from
1976, performed in its seven-part entirety. Nothing much has changed on that 
grim planet of the future. The priests of the Temples of Syrinx are still 
oppressive, power-mad dunderheads, and the hero's presentation of the guitar 
("Discovery") falls stupidly on their tin ears, which then necessitates 
"Oracle: The Dream" and "Soliloquy" and "The Grand Finale."<p>

Rush understands drama as much as it does power riffing -- how to gain
traction with plot and conflict, especially when they can cashier it to a 
denouement that turns on individualism and freedom through music.<p>

Canada's finest knows concert value, too. A giant video screen stretched
behind Peart, and music videos, liquidy computer graphics and newsreels beamed 
through the night. A generous, high-tech light show topped off the 
proceedings.<p>

"The Grand Finale" marked only the halfway point. After a 20-minute 
intermission, the group returned to bring on more of everything, filling out 
the evening to a three-hour festival of prog-rock triangulation and visual 
stimuli.<p>

The light show was stepped up on "Red Sector A" as green lasers beamed
by on-stage satellite dishes crisscrossed and formed holograms.<p>

Peart made a fetching sight when he lapsed into a grand mal seizure on
several banks of drums for a 10-minute solo.<p>

Lifeson proved better at rhythm than at lead guitar. His leads heave
into the shred bin too often, or they simply screech, but for the heavy metal 
riffing and atmospheric segues that are the meat-and-potatoes of Rush 
material, he is the ideal counterpart to Lee and Peart.<p>

Of the new material, "Animate" seems to create the most sparks.<p>

Among the abundant selections of older cuts that rang the audience's
chimes were "Limelight," "The Trees," "The Spirit of Radio" and "Tom 
Sawyer."<p>

Come to think of it, I'll let the air out of those pretentious review titles
I cited above and opt for something simple and heartfelt: "Rock critic sues
stinking-rich Canadians, claims to have suffered split retina from lasers."<p>
