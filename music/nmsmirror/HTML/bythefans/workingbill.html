I get up with Hillary<br>
In her curlers she looks really fine!<br>
I've got some time to run outside<br>
And show off those legs of mine!<p>

Maybe after some breakfast I should pass a plan<br>
For health care for the common man<br>
I guess that's why they call me<br>
Call me the donut man<br>
Well, they call me the donut man<br>
I guess that's what I am<p>

I turn the corner to the Golden Arches<br>
And I order myself 26 Quarter Pounders<br>
I will suck up 8 shakes as my<br>
Domestic policy flounders<p>

Seems to me that for my tummy's sake<br>
It's almost time to take a donut break<br>
I guess that's why they call me<br>
Call me the donut man!<br>
Well, they call me the donut man<br>
Why do you think I ran?<p>
