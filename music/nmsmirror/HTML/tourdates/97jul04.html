<font size=+1>Band's body of work 'Like the diary of growing up'</font><br>
<strong>by PAUL CANTIN</strong><p>

The members of Rush have never been ones to revel in past glories, but
this year, they're making a tentative exception.<p>

For starters, they recently remastered their entire early catalogue of
studio albums -- from the 1974 self-titled debut through 1987's Hold Your 
Fire -- and prepared a pair of best-of anthologies. And for their current tour, 
which arrives at the Corel Centre on Friday, they've decided to take advantage 
of the three-hour "An Evening With Rush" format to revisit some of the band's 
neglected past.<p>

That means alongside material from their latest album, Test For Echo,
they'll play the entire 1976 conceptual epic, 2112, drummer Neil Peart says.<p>

"It's the first time ever in history. When it came out in 1976, we were
still an opening act with a 25 minute set, so giving 20 minutes of that 25 
minute set (to 2112) wouldn't work, so we had an abridged version. Then other 
albums came along and (2112) got shorter and shorter," Peart says backstage 
prior to a New Jersey concert.<p>

Before a question has scarcely been posed, Peart darts off with an
articulate, well-reasoned response -- not because he's on interview autopilot, 
but because his mind is as quick and finely tuned as his drum-work.<p>

"There's interesting things when you go back," he says of reconsidering
the trio's track record for the current tour. "Some things don't sound 
the way they are catalogued in my mind."<p>

It's a point best illustrated by a trawl through the Rush catalogue,
too. Taken as a body of work, the remastered CDs chart the trio's fascinating 
evolution. They started life as a not-very-inventive boogie band on 1974's 
Rush. By the time they recorded 1975's Fly By Night, Peart had replaced 
original drummer John Rutsey and was edging the band into a more cerebral 
direction.  By 2112 and 1977's A Farewell To Kings, the music became more 
complex and the lyrics began to draw on influences as diverse as 
philosopher/novelist Ayn Rand and fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien, before 
finally arriving at the less didactic, thoughtful songs of recent records like 
the latest, Test For Echo.<p>

"The nicest thing anyone has ever said is that the band has been a
soundtrack to people's lives. Because it is such a direct reflection of how we
really are," says Peart.<p>

"A lot of bands are making up a mythology and writing songs to suit it,
being 'the rock guys.' Or writing to a formula for the radio or whatever 
popular taste happens to be. For us, it has been like a diary.<p>

"As our tastes have changed musically -- and certainly for me lyrically -- 
that has always been reflected for me. As I have questioned different values 
and the passing of time and what that is all worth, all that has been 
reflected in the music in a very direct sense.  It has sort of been like the 
diary of growing up, like Adrian Mole."<p>

Rand's me-first philosophy colored early Rush work like Anthem and 2112,
but the rhetoric has softened into a more humanistic approach on recent Rush 
albums. But when music represents such a direct reflection of Peart's own 
state-of-mind at any given time, doesn't he run the risk of performing songs 
with ideas he no longer holds?<p>

"Those would be ones that we would disavow. There were songs suggested
we play, but we said we wouldn't be able to relate to that, more musically 
than lyrically," he says.<p>

"The lyrical growth has been a process of expansion. There's nothing I
would recant. But musically there are things that make me cringe. Those were 
ones that, when they were brought up, we would say, no, no. Not that."<p>

So what songs can Peart, Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson not bring
themselves to perform now?<p>

"That's nobody's business, really," he says.<p>

"Every song we do play is one we want to play. Even one as popular as
The Spirit Of Radio, we felt stale on it and we put it out of the set. We 
retired it for awhile."<p>

Over the course of 23 years, Rush has toured and recorded relentlessly,
and always managed to attract a new, young audience while maintaining a core 
following.  Despite those years in the public, they have jealously guarded 
their privacy. Peart still sounds angered by rampant, false Internet rumors 
last year that claimed he was dying of brain cancer.  Even after all this 
time, Peart says he is still mystified by celebrity -- a topic he tackled 
in the 1981 song Limelight.<p>

"And how poignant it becomes onstage every night! I look out at people
singing that song and I wonder how deeply it resonates. How much do they 
understand?<p>

"It was an effort to try to explain something that seems to be
unexplainable. No matter how many times I go over it, it leaves bad feelings 
or leaves them mystified. Since that song, I have left the subject alone," 
he says.<p>

"Doesn't anyone else think this is weird, to be treated like that? Set
apart like that and treated in such an inhuman way? Little kids can see it. 
When my daughter was small and would see people treating me weird, some 
stranger coming up to me on the street, she would think that was so weird.<p>

"It is weird. It is unnatural for a stranger to come up to you that way.
It remains a strange feeling unless you numb yourself to it or play along 
with it, as I see a lot of people do. 'You love me? I love me too!' You have 
a choice of responses, and I always get embarrassed, because it is a very 
unnatural position to be in. It could never be otherwise."<p>

After this tour, the drummer expects another studio album, followed by a
live album drawing from the current and previous tour, as well as a 1979 BBC 
recording that never made it to broadcast. And then, most likely, more touring. 
Surprisingly, Peart says it was the thought of playing the same songs night 
after night that originally pushed the group to explore arcane, challenging 
song structures. That challenge drives the group to this day.<p>

"The good thing is, a song like Tom Sawyer (from 1981's Moving Pictures)
is challenging enough and remains challenging enough, that it is never 
going to be easy to play and it is never going to be boring.<p>

"We never have that albatross some bands have of being tired of their
songs and endlessly having to rearrange them in some weird way, just to keep 
your own interest alive.<p>

"We were writing songs to play them live night after night, so we were
aware of making them challenging and exciting in personal terms. Over 20 
years, that stands us in good stead."<p>

Oh, what a Rush</font><br>
<strong>by Paul Cantin</strong><p>

RUSH has been honored with Junos by the record industry and the Order Of
Canada by its country, but the prize they really deserve hasn't been
invented yet.<p>

Attracting a rabid following willing to accommodate musical growth and
change, sticking to ideals but adapting new ideas with dignity, staying
steadfastly independent in a business that endorses compromise and
conformity -- they don't hand out medals for that kind of thing, but they
should. And bassist-singer Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer
Neil Peart should be inaugural members of that pantheon.<p>

Last night, the band's marathon Test For Echo tour wrapped up at the Corel
Centre with a three hour performance before 8,500 of the faithful. And it
began with a typical Rushian sense of the spectacular and the absurd.<p>

As the houselights dimmed, the PA played Pavement's song Stereo, complete
with kidding lyrical reference to Rush's singer ("What about the voice of
Geddy Lee? How did it get so high? I wonder if he speaks like an ordinary
guy?"). That led into Thus Spake Zarathustra, accompanied by rear-screen
projections of an interstellar bolt melding with (I'm not kidding) a cosmic
hardware nut.<p>

And then, in an eruption of light and noise, Lee, Lifeson and Peart
appeared, zipping through a breathless brace of songs, including Limelight
and Stick It Out, and were greeted like conquering heroes.<p>

Lee's voice has always been an acquired taste, but he was in superb form,
showing no obvious strain from the months of touring. Lifeson's low-key
side project Victor seems to have had the lingering effect of refining and
honing his performance. But the real treat of any Rush concert is watching
Peart, literally surrounded by a wall of percussion instruments,
athletically serving up dexterous, rhythmic marvels. Rush must be the only
group to attract a legion of air-drummers to every show.<p>

Closing night giddiness had the threesome in high spirits during an
expanded rendition of Closer To The Heart, with Lifeson and Lee attempting
some hilariously feeble choreography. Snuggled surreally next to Lee's bass
amps was a fridge covered in souvenir magnets. During intermission, the
screen showed kitschy drive-in snack bar ads, and in the song Test For
Echo, a satellite dish flashed lasers onto the arena roof.<p>

Then all hell broke loose during Tom Sawyer, with crew members staging a
puppet show behind Lifeson's amps, and a stage invasion by a beefy male
hula dancer. During an encore race through the instrumental YYZ, the band
teased the crowd with a brief hint of their outer-space epic, Cygnus X-1.<p>

The sound and lighting were as flawless as the musicianship. Speaker
stacks suspended around the hockey rink allowed the sound to careen around
the room and create cool stereo-panning effects. Songs like Driven (with a
Lee bass solo inserted into the mid-section), the anti-totalitarianism
parable The Trees and Roll The Bones were enhanced by slick conceptual
video sequences.<p>

The performance was also assisted by a superbly-directed multi-camera
video crew, which broadcast an up-close view of the trio's instrumental
work onto the big screen. During Red Barchetta, the effect was 
particularly... well, effective.<p>

Peart had said in an earlier interview that there were certain songs the
group can't bring themselves to play anymore, and given the selection of
songs at last night's show, we'll take that to mean anything off the
group's pre-1976 oeuvre. Nothing from that era made the cut.<p>

The good news for longtime Rush fans, though, was the inclusion of their
conceptual monster, 2112 -- performed in its entirety for the first time on
this tour. During the staccato intro, a whole row of fanatics at the front
pumped their fists skyward in perfect choreography with each eruption of
noise. Critics and hipsters may scratch their heads, but is there any doubt
hardcore Rush fans had been waiting a long time to hear the unabridged
version of this sci-fi fable?<p>

By post-punk standards, it's hopelessly grandiose, and let's not pine for
the days of prog-rock. But in a time when dumbing down music is the cool
thing to do, it's nice to know someone still likes to think big.<p>

The band members have consistently denied rumors that this is their last
tour. But if this is the end of Rush, last night's show would stand as a
stellar swansong.<p>

Party atmosphere proves Rush still rocks</font><br>
<strong>by CHRIS COBB</strong><p>

Aside from the usual crew of head shakers and air thumpers at the front of
the stage, the Rush crowd at the Corel Centre Friday was a quiet,
respectful bunch of people intent on listening rather than using the music
as a background for their own antics. A casual observer might have judged
them to be bored for most of the two-and-a-half hours the Toronto trio was
onstage.<p>

Bored they were not and proof came at the end when most of the 14,000 or
so rose with the house lights. There had not been the usual early gallop to
the parking lot: if the band had played until 2 a.m. -- and they have more
than enough songs to do so -- most everyone would have stayed put.<p>

This was the last date of the Rush Test For Echo tour and there was a
palpable party atmosphere onstage, particularly during the last 30 minutes.
The backstage crew was intent on fun, and frontmen Geddy Lee and Alex
Lifeson were infected too. The end of a tour, and the grind of traveling,
is a joyous occasion, especially for those who work in the shadows.<p>

Rush occupies a unique place in rock. Guitarist Lifeson, bassist-vocalist
Lee and drummer-philosopher prince Neil Peart, have sustained a successful
career, while their English progressive rock counterparts (Yes, Genesis,
Emmerson, Lake and Palmer included) have atrophied. Why? Perhaps it has
something to do with attitude -- and, of course, lots of ear-splitting
noise, eye-popping lights lights and computerized techno wizardry.<p>

The live Rush has moved closer to its audiences over the years and that
has been important to the group's survival. Lee does most of the audience
relations work. Lifeson cruises on the vanity ramps, contorts his face and
shows off his fret work. There's nothing modern about that. Peart, remote
and hard-working, pounds away on his semi-circle of percussion -- the Rush
engine.<p>

As Geddy Lee suggested at the outset, one of the group's challenges is
deciding which of its vast number of songs to play. Doubtless there were
some disappointments at tunes omitted, but the tops of the waves were
touched -- superb versions of Roll The Bones, Nobody's Hero, Closer To The
Heart. Most of the songs were accompanied by excellent videos which were
unfortunately obscured for many on the sides of the arena by hanging light
structures.<p>

Rush isn't, and never has been, above self indulgence, but over 25 years
its audience has grown to tolerate the excesses and the band itself has
tempered its inclination to drift off into obscure musical interludes. Even
Peart's trademark drum solo has developed into something more than an
impressive sounding (though not always impressive) interlude of meandering.
On Friday, it brought him a standing ovation and was the only time during
the evening when the whole audience became obviously animated.<p>

And experience has taught Lee, Peart and Lifeson how to pace a concert to
perfection.<p>

So Rush was hot on Friday: welded as tight as any band currently touring.
For all those who stayed until the lights went up, the traffic jam at the
end of the night was doubtless a small price to pay.<p>
