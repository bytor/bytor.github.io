"Rock 'n' roll royalty"</font><br>
by Nicholas Jennings<p>

     Geddy Lee visibly tenses up when he talks about the period when fans 
drove him and his family out of their east-end Toronto home.  It was the  
late 1970s, and Lee's band, Rush, was the undisputed champion of arena    
rock in Canada.  He and his wife, Nancy Young, and their small son were   
leading a quiet life in the Beaches: a middle-class neighborhood, until   
Rush fans discovered where the band's bassist-singer lived.  From then on,
recalls Lee, the family felt besieged as strangers peered through windows 
and demanded autographs, guitars and even, on occasion, money.  Faced with
constant intrusions, the Lees fled, settling in an affluent downtown      
Toronto area.  And for more than a decade, the reluctant star carefully   
guarded his family's privacy.  Like Rush's other two members, guitarist   
Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart, Lee refused to allow the media into  
his home or to discuss anything more personal than this music.  But now,  
as they embark on their 18th year together, and with the recent release of
their 14th studio album and the opening next month of another world tour, 
the members of Rush are breaking their silence.<p>
                                                                         
     In lengthy conversation in their homes, Lee, Peart and Lifeson       
revealed themselves to be stable -- and extremely prosperous -- elder         
statesmen of rock'n' roll.  Far from the stereotype of rocks stars as     
ravaged hedonists, they say that they prefer to dabble in art collecting, 
not drugs.  As they approach 40, they are devoted family men with         
marriages of long standing.  Said Sam Sniderman, Toronto-based owner of   
the Sam the Record Man chain: "They're good apples -- squeaky clean."  All  
three express a yearning for respect, as well as frustration that Rush is 
still regarded as a heavy-metal band for teenage boys -- despite they       
group's more varied style.  And that, said 38-year-old Lee, is one reason 
why they decided to talk.  "We may never be digestible.  "But there's a   
part of us that wants to be viewed in the proper light."                  
<p>
                                                                         
     A multimillion-dollar entity for 15 years, Rush has enjoyed a        
longevity that is unparalleled in Canadian rock.  The band was born in 1968
when high-school friends Lee and Lifeson, both living in the Toronto      
suburb of Willowdale, decided to form a band.  Peart, a native of St.     
Catherines, Ont., joined in 1974 -- the same year that Rush's self-titled   
debut album appeared.  In the early days, the band won over a young,      
denim-clad audience with its bone-crunching sound and mystical message.   
But it left critics cold.  In 1977, Robert Christgau of New York City's   
the Village Voice called Rush "the most obnoxious band currently making a 
killing on the zonked teen circuit."  And Lee's vocal style, described as 
an "air-raid siren" or likened to a "wailing banshee," proved an major     
irritant for many.                                                        
<p>
                                                                         
     Now, the three musicians can afford to ignore their critics.  Managed
from the beginning by Ray Danniels, with whom the three members own their 
Toronto-based record company, Anthem, Rush has sold more than 30 million  
records around the world -- which makes it the top Canadian band for        
international sales in history.  One industry insider estimates that even 
in years when Rush does not release a new album or go on tour, Anthem     
earns at least $10 million from sales and royalties.  The band's latest   
release, Roll then Bones, shows signs of becoming their best-selling      
record to date, having rocketed immediately to third place on the        
Billboard album charts -- their previous albums took weeks to get that high.
At the same time, Rush is one of the top-grossing live rock acts in the   
world: last year, the band earned $16 million from the 70 dates on its    
North American tour alone.  And the upcoming nine-month tour, which opens 
on Oct. 25 in Hamilton, is expected to do even better.

     Lee and his partners may have difficulty with the fishbowl pressures 
of fame, but they clearly have no problems with their commercial success. 
High-school dropouts from working-class backgrounds, each grew up with an 
obsession for hard rock matched by an unusually strong work ethic.  Now,  
all three have at least two residences and many of the trappings of       
wealth.  Sitting in the living room of the large, elegant 19th-century    
coach house that he shares with his wife, who owns the Toronto clothing   
design company Zapata, and their now-adolescent son, Lee spoke about his  
good fortune.  "Let's face it," he said, dressed casually, with his long  
black hair hanging loosely about his shoulders, "it's a darn good job and 
we do very well.  But now, I'm not afraid to say no to Rush.  My family's 
extremely important to me."                                               
<p>
                                                                         
     There was a time when Rush ruled the lives of Lee, Lifeson and Peart.
Months of recording were allowed by a year of constant touring.  Then, it 
was back into the studio to make another album.  They were, Lee says,     
hopeless workaholics.  But that all changed after their 1987 album, Hold  
Your Fire, and the subsequent five-month world tour.  Lee recalls that the
three returned to Canada sick and distanced from their wives and children.
During a seven-month break made possible by the release of the live       
recording A Show of Hands, they reached some crucial decisions about their
lives.  Said Lee: "Call it maturity, but we discovered that we didn't have
to be obsessed about Rush 24 hours a day.  It was just one of the things  
that we do."

     Since that turning point, the three men have made the job of their   
manager, Danniels, much more difficult.  Now, when he plans a tour for the
group, he has to wear at least two hats: one as booking agent, the other  
as holiday consultant.  One of Lee's conditions for touring is that he    
gets to spend 10 days off with his family for every three weeks on the    
road.  Peart, 39, the group's lyricist, in an avid cyclist who, whenever  
possible, travels between stops on bicycle.  Lifeson, 38, insists on      
tennis courts so that he and Lee can play on their days off.  And Lee, who
is also a serious baseball enthusiast, tries to take in an afternoon game 
whenever possible on the North American legs of their tours.  Said Danniels:
"Most managers don't have to deal with so many tour demands, but how many  
of them have clients that go on forever?"                                 
<p>
                                                                         
     Success has allowed the members of Rush to thorough indulge their    
passion.  Peart, the son of a farm-equipment dealer, has trekked and      
cycled through China and Africa -- and then had his own travelogues printed
in book form for distribution among friends.  Married to art dealer Jackie
Taylor -- they have a teenage daughter -- he has won a reputation as one of   
the rare bookworms of the rock world.  Peart says that he grew up with the
disparate goals of becoming a drummer, like his hero, Keith Moon of The   
Who, and a self-educated Renaissance man.  The den of his house in the    
wealthy Toronto enclave of Forest Hill is filled with books ranging from  
philosophy to travel literature.  In his upstairs study, Peart talked     
about his literary fascinations -- and aspirations.  An articulate man with a  
boyish grin, he said that he occasionally corresponds with some of his    
favorite writers, including Tom Robbins and John Barth.  And he admitted  
that he would one day like to see a work of his own on bookstore shelves. 
Said Peart:  "Writing lyrics for Rush forced me to grow up in public.  So 
writing prose is, for the time being, a strictly private pursuit."        
<p>
                                                                         
     Peart's literary influences have been painfully obvious in Rush's    
music.  After a flirtation with the fantasy writing J. R. R. Tolkien,     
whose Lord of the Rings trilogy inspired such early Rush recording as Fly 
by Night (1975) and Caress of Steel (1975), Peart discovered the science  
fiction of Isaac Asimov and Frank Herbert.  But when he credited the      
inspiration for his lyrics on the 1976 album 2112 to archconservative U.S.
novelist Ayn Rand, controversy hit the group.  A writer for the British   
weekly New Musical Express labeled Rush "fascist" after an interview with
Peart.  Lee said that he found the charges particularly painful because   
his parents, Polish Jews named Weinrib (Lee is his stage name), both spent
time the Nazi concentration camps.  Looking back on it now, Peart laughs 
at his naivete.  "I'm not an 'ist' of any kind and never have been -- except
maybe an individualist," he said.                                         
<p>
                                                                         
     Much has changed in the 15 years since then.  Rush now enjoys what   
industry insiders described as one of the most lucrative recording        
contracts in the music business with their international label, Atlantic  
Records.  And the band gets regular radio airplay (their current single,  
Dreamline, was the most requested song last week on U.S. stations) while  
even garnering the occasional good review.  Said Lee: "Now punk music and 
slash metal have legitimized our sound.  By not changing, we changed.     
Things around us become more raw and we became more palatable."           
<p>
                                                                         
     Still, for all its success, maturity and wider acceptance, the image 
of Rush as a post-adolescent heavy-metal power trio lingers.  And that    
leaves the band with a lower profile than many less successful performers  
have.  But Lifeson, for one, says that he does not mind the anonymity that
Rush affords him.  With his wife, Charlene, and their boys, one teenage   
and one grown, he lives in a two-acre estate -- complete with swimming pool 
and tennis court -- in Stoufville, Ont., north of Toronto.  Said a tanned   
and athletic-looking Lifeson, the son of Yugoslavian immigrants with the 
name Zivojinovich: "I don't get hounded the way Geddy does, because I look
like a regular guy.  But Geddy has such a distinctive appearance that     
people can really pick him out in a crowd."  He added: "Me, I can take the
kids to school or do the grocery shopping, no problem.  It's very normal."

     Relatively quiet offstage, and self-conscious -- sometimes to a fault -- 
in their music and lyrics, the members of Rush are perhaps the quint-     
essential Canadian musical heroes.  Theirs is a music that SCTV characters
Dough and Bob McKenzie -- with whom Lee sang on the 1982 comedy hit Take    
Off -- would affectionately call hoser rock.  And it is their Canadian-ness 
that has kept Rush from moving, like so many, to the United States.  Said 
Lee: "Canadians aren't people who like to quit on anything.  All three of 
us have been in relationships for a long time, both with our wives and    
each other."  The same is true, added Lee, of the band's relationship with
Canada, with its relatively high tax rates.  "We're not ready to give up  
on it yet," he said.                                                      
<p>
                                                                         
     Lee says that he had learned to deal with celebrity -- he even agrees  
to sign autographs now.  "It's working," he said, adding with a deadpan   
expression, "I've just accepted the fact that my epitaph's going to read: 
'There's the guy from Rush.'"<p>
