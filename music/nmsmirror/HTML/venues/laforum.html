Directions<br>

<strong>From Orange County:</strong> Take I-405 North to Manchester Blvd. 
Exit and go east. The Forum will be on the right-hand side about a mile 
down, on the corner of Manchester and Prairie.<p>

<strong>Parking:</strong> $7. The only real parking is in the lot; don't try
to park and walk from a side street.<p>
</ul>

Music Stores in the Area<br>
</font>
<ul>
<strong>Ken Crane's Laserdiscs</strong><br>
The LARGEST laserdisc store I've ever seen! They give discounts (generally
10%) on all stock in the store, except imports, and have a large selection.
Located on Beach Blvd about 10 miles south of Knott's Berry Farm. Easiest
way to get there: take the 91 freeway to Beach Blvd, exit and head north.
Will be a few blocks down on the left.<p>

<strong>Digital Ear</strong><br>
Lots of imports and some used CD's, will do special order. Also has
stereo equipment, if you just MUST buy those 6-foot-tall speakers you've
been wanting. Take the 55 freeway to 17th St, exit and go East (into
Tustin). The store will be in a shopping center a mile or so down on the 
right.

Places To Eat<br>
</font>
<ul>
<strong>The Crab Cooker</strong> (Newport Beach & Tustin)<br>
Try their world-famous clam chowder, and see the only restaurant to keep
its fish in a former bank vault (the one at Newport Beach used to be a
Bank of America, you can still see what's left of their logo at the top
of the building). Try the shrimp on a skewer, and the smoked albacore
appetizer. Lunch and dinner prices differ, so try for lunch. Make sure
to take quarters if you head to Newport Beach, all parking is metered!<p>

Great place for food and show, although don't expect utensils! They put on
a jousting tournament while you dine and cheer for your knight. Tickets are
expensive, around $30, but parking is free. Make reservations in advance.
Located off of Beach Blvd a few miles north of Knott's Berry Farm.

Ah, who can resist a visit to the happiest place on earth? Located in Anaheim,
just a stone's-throw from the I-5 freeway. Take I-5 to Harbor Blvd, exit and
follow the signs (Katella Ave. exit will also get you there). Ticket prices
last time I checked were in the $27 range, with $4 parking per car. Plan
to spend the whole day there! Some tips: tends to be less crowded on Mondays
(not quite sure why), overcast days mean less people (they think it will rain),
wait until a parade starts then ride all the popular attractions (Matterhorn,
Space Mountain, Splash Mountain), go on the Submarine after dark (when all
the little kids go home). The arcade next to Space Mountain has some GREAT 
classic games, and for an interesting lunch try the Blue Bayou (behind and
actually INSIDE Pirates of the Caribbean).<p>

Lesser known than its counterpart Disneyland, but just as fun! Go back to
the old west, take a stagecoach ride, get held up on the train, pan for gold,
or even see California's only active volcano! Ticket prices are about the
same as Disneyland, $25 last time I went. One neat thing is that the park
is divided into the rides (you have to pay), and a bunch of restaurants
and stores that are free to enter. Parking is free. Even if you don't go
for the rides, definitely stop off at the Chicken Dinner House (don't be
discouraged by a long line, it moves quickly) for lunch! Make sure to get
something with boysenberries, the berry that Walter Knott "invented".
Take I-5 to Beach
Blvd, exit and head south; or take the 91 to Beach Blvd and head north.
