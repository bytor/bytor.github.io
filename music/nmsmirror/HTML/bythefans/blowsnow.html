by Simon Charles<br>
<em>January 29, 1997</em><p>

You can blow that snow<br>
To the top of your roof<br>
Drag your wet and slushy boots<br>
Under you<p>

You can wear that coat<br>
With an extra sweater<br>
You will still freeze and feel back pain<br>
In the morrow<p>

Blow away the snow<br>
(Everyone)<br>
Blow away the snow<br>
Make the driveway narrower<br>
Each time you use that snow blower<p>

You can drive that snow<br>
To the end of your lawn<br>
The big city plough will still push it<br>
Right back at you<p>

Try to deny<br>
The weight of the snow<br>
Try to make a path for your car<br>
For tomorrow<p>

Move away the snow<br>
(All husbands)<br>
Move away the snow<br>
Scrape that asphalt in rage<br>
'Cuz your neighbour blew his snow on yours<p>

Push away the snow<br>
(Not Again)<br>
Push away the snow<br>
Oops a flying rock just broke a window<br>
And you hope it's not your own<p>
</body>
