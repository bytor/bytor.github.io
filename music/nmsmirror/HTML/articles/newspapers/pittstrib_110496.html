<font size=+1>Rush gives loyal audience a theatrical performance</font><br>
<b>by Rege Behe</b><p>

        To paraphrase comedian Bill Murray, there are only two types of
people in the world: those who love Rush and those who hate Rush.<p>

        Now, we're not talking about the portly political commentator, but
the Canadian trio whose brand of progressive rock has somehow stood the test
of time for more than 25 years, at least among their fans.<p>

        Sunday night at the Civic Arena, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil
Peart returned to the site of the first show in the United States (August
16, 1974, according to Lee) playing to a large crowd that seemed enthralled
my the group's theatrics, technical wizardry and stage show that included
cardboard cutouts of Marilyn Monroe, Pamela Anderson, and the Three Stooges,
a working refrigerator and an often stunning light show.<p>
        "Dreamline" opened the show, a spacy, meandering song about being
young and full of wonder.<p>
        Hmmm.  Okay, you have to give the group the benefit of the doubt on
this one, since it's possible you're only as old as you feel (although
before intermission, Lee poked fun at the group's taking a 'Geritol break').
Much to the band's credit, however, they didn't act like relics on the stage.<p>
        Bassist Lee, resembling a thinner version of shock rock deejay
Howard Stern, moved across the stage like a whippet, piercing through the
wall of music with his inimitable voice.<p>
        Guitarist Lifeson sound like a chorus of Strotocasters at times,
flaying his guitar with amazing passion.<p>
        And drummer Peart...is there any drummer more revered by his fans?
In every row last night, there was at least one guy playing air drums,
trying to keep up with the complex rhythms and syncopation Peart is known for.<p>
        Individually, there's no doubting Rush's musical chops.<p>
        Collectively, however, the sum of the parts did not always equal the
whole.  Songs like "Big Money," "Drive," and "Red Barchetta" just go in too
many directions to fulfill Rush's sci-fi/cyberpunk/environmental visions.<p>
        When they nailed a song, however, there was an undeniable moment of
transcendence that only the most jaded of observers could deny.<p>
        "Animate" and "Nobody's Hero" fell into this category, along with
"Subdivision" and "Roll th Bones."  Sparer in structure and with less
soloing, these songs seemed subtler in approach than most of the other material.<p>
        Of course there were the Rush classics: "The Trees," "Closer to the
Heart," "Freewill," with the show ending with "Spirit of Radio" and "Tom
Sawyer."  On radio these songs sound dated and shopworn, but onstage Lee and
his mates seemed to be able to breathe new life into them.<p>
        For that alone, give the band a nod.<p>
