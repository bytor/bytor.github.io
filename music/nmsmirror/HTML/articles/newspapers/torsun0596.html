feature 12 songs, 11 vocals, and one instrumental. It is scheduled for release
in Canada and the U.S. on Sept. 3.<P>

Despite earlier speculation that the band would not tour, Rush will indeed be

band confirmed Tuesday.<P>

It will mark the first burst of activity from the trio since the October 1993
release of Counterparts. Geddy Lee, Neil Peart, and Alex Lifeson haven't
performed together on stage since a tour-ending show at Toronto's Maple Leaf
Gardens, two years ago this month.<p>
