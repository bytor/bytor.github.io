<font size=+3>Bass Shop</font><br>
by Doug Taylor<br>
<em>July 12, 1997</em><p>

It turns my head<br>
I spin around<br>
Looking across<br>
You know its been found<p>

Im playing well now --<br>
Or is it my pride?<br>
Cant be too careful<br>
With that high price beside<br>
If I could only buy this amp alongside<br>
And turn it up<p>

BASS SHOP -- So make the salesman back down<br>
BASS SHOP -- Match a price, or your savings will hit the ground...<br>
BASS SHOP -- Theres always another shop in town<br>
BASS SHOP -- Buy it up<br>
Or leave the store let down<br>
Buy it up<p>

Its in vain<br>
Price insane<br>
I dont think I like the look<br>
Of that cheaper range<p>

I'm in a groove now --<br>
Or is it a lick?<br>
I would like this bass<br>
cause it plays real slick<br>
I feel like buying, but I keep my wallet shut<br>
And turn it up<p>

I got unhappy inside<br>
Like my dream was all undone<br>
Then I got all worked up inside<br>
With an idea just begun<p>

I will buy it, leave the price aside<br>
This bass has got the perfect tone<br>
Tomorrow Im gonna turn the tide<br>
And going to get a loan<br>
Buy it up<p>
