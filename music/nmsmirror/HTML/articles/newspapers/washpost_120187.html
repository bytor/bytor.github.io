<font size=+1>Rush's Big-Bang Rock</font><br>
<b>by Todd Yasui</b><p>

It's ironic that Rush has progressed to the point where its songs are about
such weighty topics as nuclear Armageddon and technological dehumanization,
and yet the biggest audience reaction is when explosions or lasers erupt on
stage. Last night at Capital Centre, there were times when more attention was
focused on the projection screen above the stage than on what was going on
below it.  <p>

For the most part, though, it was impossible not to stare at drummer Neil
Peart. Although bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson are both
proficient on their instruments, Peart remains one of the most talented and
inventive drummers in modern music.  <p>

The instrumental "YYZ" sounded like a guitar-bass-drum orchestra, not only
technically outstanding, but also entertaining for any fan once Peart began
his drum solo. The show ended with one of the Canadian trio's earliest
compositions, "In the Mood," a mindless rollicking rocker accompanied by good
old-fashioned balloons that were dropped into the audience rather than
mind-melting lights and detonations.<p>
