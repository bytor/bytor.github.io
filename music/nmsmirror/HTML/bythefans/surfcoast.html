Well, you can stake that claim<br>
Good surf is the key to good fortune<br>
Surfers ride that wave<br>
Kooks are always lame<br>
If they don't play the game<br>
Winners ride to glory and fame<br>
We draw our own lines<br>
But fortune has to bring us the ride.<p>

We go out into the water and take our chances<br>
Fate is just the weight of water dripping down our faces<br>
That's the way we do the reef dances<br>
Surf The Coast.<br>
Surf The Coast<p>

Why are we here?<br>
Because the surf is here<br>
Surf the Coast<br>
Why does it happen?<br>
Wind, swell and tide coincide<br>
Surf The Coast.<p>

Water is cold as ice<br>
Everything shrivels up to the size of a cocktail weenie<br>
My wetsuit has all these holes<br>
But I'll brave anything to pull into a good bowl<br>
Well, who would hold a price<br>
On dropping in on some poor longboarder<br>
If there's some immortal power<br>
To help my arms last just one more hour.<p>

We come into the water and take our chances<br>
Fate is just the weight of water dripping down our faces<br>
That's the way we do the reef dances<br>
Surf The Coast<p>

Dude - relax.<br>
Get dizzy while you get whitewater thrashed<br>
No tow-in zodiacs, or weather almanacs<br>
Just the weather radio cube<br>
Gonna get into some localism feued<br>
Ride in the tube<br>
Got a twinnie, thruster, or quad?<br>
Now look at my hard surfer bod<br>
Waves may be small, but sure to get bigger<br>
It's a rig - you dig?<br>
It's action, instinct reaction<br>
Random wave satisfaction<br>
Get the facts from the weather page<br>
Can that job for minimum wage<br>
Grab your stick<br>
And ditch your babe<br>
And ride some waves.<p>

What's the deal?<br>
Get behind the wheel<br>
Car, bike, or skateboard<br>
If the waves are hot<br>
There's waves to be got<br>
You know what you should be holdin'<br>
That one magic board under your arm<br>
That's so dinged and old'n<br>
Score the dawn patrol gold<br>
The ocean favors the bold<br>
Sittin' outside, watch me snake the wave of the day<br>
That's cold, some may say<br>
Now I'm throwin' a rooster-tail spray<br>
Get out of my way<br>
The day has a thousand swells<br>
So get in the lineup and rock<br>
And Surf the Coast!<p>
