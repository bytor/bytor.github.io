"The title came after the record, which isn't always the way it
works. We're at that period in our lives where we're starting to
question our relationahips with each other. You start to ask 'Why am
I still hanging around with these guys?' To some extent 'Counterparts'
is a recognition of how the three of us have grown in different ways of the
past few years.

"For the opening track, 'Animate,' for instance, I used a basic R&B
rhythm that I played back in my early days, coupled with that hypnotic
effect that a lot of the British bands of the turn of the 90's
had--bands like Curve and Lush.  The middle section of the tune is the
result of the impact African music has had on me, although it wasn't a
specific African rhythm.

<font size=+1><strong>Neil on the meaning behind the song's
title:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Neil Peart ("<A HREF="18.cppremiere.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/RUSH/18.cppremiere.html">Counterparts Radio 
Premiere</a>"): </strong>
It's just a play on the words, really. "Stick It Out" meaning both a
kind of arrogant display, "stick it out", but also the endurance thing; if  
you have a difficult thing to endure, stick it out and you get to the end. It
was the pun on both of those, really, so again the duality in the song is a
bit leaning both ways. The sense of forbearance, of holding back, and also   
the idea of fortitude: stick it out, you know, survive. But that was more of 
a piece of fun, that song I would say, both lyrically and musically it verges
on parody, and that was one I think we just had fun with, and lyrically I
certainly did, too. "Stick it out" and "spit it out" and all that was just a
bit of word play.

A song like "Stick It Out" proved difficult for Neil because of its

"How could I approach that song properly and yet give it a touch of elegance 
that I would want a riff-rock song to have?  I don't want it to be the same 
type of thing you'd hear on rock radio.  So I started bringing in Latin and 
fusion influences.  There's a verse where I went for a Weather Report-type 
effect.  I used some tricky turn-arounds in the ride cymbal pattern, where 
it goes from downbeat to upbeat accents--anything I could think of to make 
it my own.  That song verges on parody for us, so we had to walk a careful 
line.  We responded to the power of the riff, yet still found some ways to 
twist it to make it something more."

Stick It Out
----- -- ---
Trust to your instincts
If it's safely restrained
Lightning reactions
Must be carefully trained

Heat of the moment
Curse of the young
Spit out your anger
Don't swallow your tongue

STICK IT OUT

Don't swallow the poison                                      
SPIT IT OUT
Don't swallow your pride                                       
STICK IT OUT
Don't swallow your anger                                      
SPIT IT OUT
Don't swallow the lies
                                 
Natural reflex
Pendulum swing
You might be too dizzy 
To do the right thing

Trial under fire
Ultimate proof
Moment of crisis
Don't swallow the truth                              

STICK IT OUT

Each time we bathe our reactions
In artificial light
Each time we alter the focus
To make the wrong moves seem right

You get so used to deception
You make yourself a nervous wreck
You get so used to surrender
Running back to cover your neck

STICK IT OUT

<strong>(<a href="../HTML/articles/gp1293.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/gp1293.html">Guitar Player, December 1993</a>): </strong>
On several songs, including the punchy "Cut To The Chase", Lifeson's 
bandmates encouraged him to keep the original guide solos. "Solos are a 
funny thing," Alex observes, "Many solos I record at the demo stage make 
it to the final mix. I tend to be a perfectionist, but I've come to realize 
my best work is spontaneous. An unrehearsed solo may not be particularly in
time or in tune, but it can possess an emotional quality that's very 
difficult to recapture. At this point, I'd rather live with some technical 
imperfections."

Cut To The Chase
--- -- --- -----
It is the fire that lights itself
But it burns with a restless flame
The arrow on a moving target
The archer must be sure of his aim

It is the engine that drives itself
But it chooses the uphill climb
A bearing on magnetic north
Growing farther away all the time
Can't stop -- moving
Can't stop -- moving
Can't stop

YOU MAY BE RIGHT
IT'S ALL A WASTE OF TIME
I GUESS THAT'S JUST A CHANCE
I'M PREPARED TO TAKE
A DANGER I'M PREPARED TO FACE
CUT TO THE CHASE

It is the rocket that ignites itself
And launches its way to the stars
A driver on a busy freeway
Racing the oblivious cars

It's the motor of the western world
Spinning off to every extreme
Pure as a lover's desire
Evil as a murderer's dream

Young enough not to care too much
About the way things used to be
I'm young enough to remember the future --
The past has no claim on me

I'm old enough not to care too much
About what you think of me
But I'm young enough to remember the future
And the way things ought to be

WHAT KIND OF DIFFERENCE
CAN ONE PERSON MAKE?
CUT TO THE CHASE

February 1994</a>)</strong>
I had a lot of reflections over the last couple of
years about the nature of heroism, what a 'role model' is supposed to
be, and the differences between the two.  That thought manifested itself
in a song on the new album called 'Nobody's Hero.'  A role model is
obviously a very positive example of what can be accomplished, and it's
what I think, with all humility and pride, Rush has been--a good role
model for other bands.

<strong><font size=+1>Nobody's Hero - on AIDS/Homosexuality</font></strong><br><br>
<dd>
<strong>Neil Peart (<a href="../HTML/articles/raw1193.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/raw1193.html">Raw Magazine, 1993</a>): </strong>
"If people think that discussing homosexuality is controversial,
then they've been living under a rock. "Nobodys Hero" will probably
polarise people, even though the AIDS issue is only a small part of
the lyrical theme, and people will probably jump to conclusions.
That's their problem. I don't worry about it, whether it's brave or
foolish or whatever. When things affect you, you talk about them and
it comes out in your music. You let it fly. I never had the slightest
idea that it could be interpreted as controversial until someone
pointed it out to me after we'd finished the record. I guess I've
always worked in the music business, which is a very tolerant
environment."

Nobody's Hero
-------- ----
I knew he was different, in his sexuality
I went to his parties, as a straight minority
It never seemed a threat to my masculinity
He only introduced me to a wider reality     
   
As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that he was gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart 
But he's nobody's --

Hero -- saves a drowning child
Cures a wasting disease
Hero -- lands the crippled airplane
Solves great mysteries

Hero -- not the handsome actor 
Who plays a hero's role
Hero -- not the glamor girl 
Who'd love to sell her soul
If anybody's buying 
NOBODY'S HERO

I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family
All their lives were shattered 
in a nightmare of brutality
They try to carry on, try to bear the agony
Try to hold some faith 
in the goodness of humanity                           
   
As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that she was gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart
But she's nobody's --

Hero -- the voice of reason 
Against the howling mob           
Hero -- the pride of purpose 
In the unrewarding job          

Hero -- not the champion player 
Who plays the perfect game
Not the glamor boy 
Who loves to sell his name
Everybody's buying 
NOBODY'S HERO
   
As the years went by, we drifted apart
When I heard that you were gone
I felt a shadow cross my heart

Yeah, in the past, "Tom Sawyer" of course was cowritten with Pye, and
"Force 10" on <u>Hold Your Fire</u> was too, and I really like his style of
writing. It's inscrutable to me, sometimes, as I think it is to other people
too, but at the same time it has a certain power in his images and writing.
And also, there was some strange symbiosis that seemed to affect the songs;
when Pye was involved in "Tom Sawyer" and in "Force 10", it made them somehow
a little different musically, you know, his percolation through me. I would get
his ideas and then I would add mine to them and structure it as a Rush song,
and then pass it along to the other guys. Even through that chain of events,
somehow there was some outside influence that was good, so we've always kind
of kept the open door to Pye's ideas. Anytime he had anything to submit he
would send it along to me, usually scrawled in an exercise book. And in this
case that was one that we all responded to some of the images in his
presentation, so again I went to work on it, shaped it up into the kind of
structure that we like to work with, and then added some of my own images and
angles on it. And so it went.

It's no surprise that 'Counterparts' acoustic guitars recall 'Tommy'-era Who 
tracks. "Pete Townshend can make an acoustic sound so heavy and powerful," 
affirms Alex. "I've always admired that. On "Between Sun And Moon" there's a 
musical bridge  before the solo that's very Who-ish. I even throw Keith 
Richards in there." Lyrically and musically, Lifeson notes, the song is 
"really a tribute to the '60s." Yet these days, he find himself listening to 
contemporary players.  "Particularly Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains -I've 
been really getting off on 'Dirt'. And I love Eric Johnson's playing."

Between Sun And Moon
------- --- --- ----
There is a lake between sun and moon
Not too many know about
In the silence between whisper and shout
The space between wonder and doubt

This is a fine place
Shining face to face
Those bonfire lights in the mirror of sky
The space between wonder and why

ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes
why the sun why the sun

There is a fine line between love and illusion --
A fine place to penetrate
The gap between actor and act
The lens between wishes and fact

This is a fine place 
To hesitate
Those bonfire lights in the lake of sky
The time between wonder and why

Some need to pray to the sun at high noon
Some need to howl at the midwinter moon
Reborn and baptized in a moment of grace
We just need a break --
From the headlong race

ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes
why the sun why the sun

This is a fine place, shining face to face
These bonfire lights in the mirrored sky
The space between wonder and why

Slave to the hormone, body and soul

Shining bridges on the ocean floor
Reaching to the alien shore

For you and me -- Sex is not a competition
For you and me -- Sex is not a job description
For you and me -- We agree

You and I, we are pressed into these solitudes
Color and culture, language and race
Just variations on a theme
Islands in a much larger stream

For you and me -- Race is not a competition
For you and me -- Race is not a definition
For you and me -- We agree

Reaching for the alien shore

You and I, we reject these narrow attitudes
We add to each other, like a coral reef
Building bridges on the ocean floor
Reaching for the alien shore

For you and me -- We'd elect each other president
For you and me -- We might agree

"'The Speed Of Love' is kind of mid-tempo, more sensitive rock
song. That song probably took me the longest to find just
the right elements I wanted to have in a drum part.  What made it a
challenge is that I wanted the feel and the transitions between sections
to be just right.  I played that song over and over, refining it until I
was satisfied.  I don't think a listener will hear all the work that

The Speed Of Love

Love is born with lightning bolts
Electro-magnetic force
Burning skin and fireworks
A storm on a raging course

Like a force of nature,
Love can fade with the stars at dawn
Sometimes it takes all your strength 
Just to keep holding on
At the speed of love
A radiance that travels
At the speed of love
My heart goes out to you.                 

Love is born with solar flares
From two magnetic poles
It moves towards a higher plane
Where two halves make two wholes

Like a force of nature,
Love shines in many forms
One night we are bathed in light
One day carried away in the storms
At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster 
Than the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

We don't have to talk
We don't even have to touch
I can feel your prescence 
In the silence that we share
Got to keep moving 
At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster 
Than the speed of love
Got to keep on shining 
At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster 
Than the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

We were losing our minds, is what we were doing! "Double Agent" was a
complete exercise in self-indulgence, and really, it was one of the last

songs that were heavily structured, and, you know, were crafted and
meticulously worked on: this note and that note, and this is a song we just
wanted to kind of get our yah-yahs out and just have a bit of a rave. And
really, it's one of the goofiest songs I think we've ever written, but I'm

Double Agent
------ -----
Where would you rather be?
Anywhere but here
When will the time be right?
Anytime but now

On the edge of sleep,
I was drifting for half the night
Anxious and restless,
pressed down by the darkness
Bound up and wound up so tight
So many decisions, a million revisions
Caught between darkness and light...

Wilderness of mirrors
World of polished steel
Gears and iron chains
Turn the grinding wheel
I run between the shadows
Some are phantoms, some are real

Where would you rather be?
Anywhere but here
When will the time be right?
Anytime but now
The doubt and the fear
I know would all disappear
Anywhere but here

On the edge of sleep,
I heard voices behind the door
The known and the nameless,
familiar and faceless
My angels and my demons at war
Which one will lose -- depends on what I choose
Or maybe which voice I ignore...

Wilderness of mirrors
Streets of cold desire
My precious sense of honor
Just a shield of rusty wire
I hold against the chaos --
And the cross of holy fire

Wilderness of mirrors
So easy to deceive
My precious sense of rightness
Is sometimes so naive
So that which I imagine
Is that which I believe

On the edge of sleep, I awoke to a sun so bright
Rested and fearless, cheered by your nearness
I knew which direction was right
The case had been tried by the jury inside
The choice between darkness and light...

<strong><font size=+1>Geddy & Alex discuss the song:</strong></font><br><br>
<dd><em>
"Cold Fire"'s one of my favorite tracks. Can you tell me a bit about that?
</em><p>

<strong>Geddy Lee ("<A HREF="18.cppremiere.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/RUSH/18.cppremiere.html">Counterparts Radio 
Premiere</a>"): </strong>
Um, "Cold Fire". That song went through many permutations.  <P>

<strong>Alex Lifeson: </strong>Yeah, that was actually one of the songs that 
we had a bit of a problem
getting into lyrically, working on it from a musical point of view.  <P> 

GL: Yeah, it was hard to know the approach, and that was a song that we felt
a little ...  <P> 

AL: That's right! Actually we had a few rewrites of this musically.  <P> 

GL: We rewrote that song quite a bit. And thankfully, I think Peter Collins'
presence really pulled that song together. He came in and he pointed out   
certain strengths in the previous versions of the songs that we had, and he  
really helped us reorganize that song. It wasn't until he got there, I think,
that we finally locked in on a feel for those verses that enabled Alex to   
play those great kind of steel guitar lines -- steel guitar-like lines -- that
he's playing, and enabled me to open up harmonically. I was having trouble
with the verses, you know, it's a tough song, when you're dealing with this
issue of male/female relationships, which is such a foreign subject for us to
deal with, in a song. You want to make sure it doesn't sound trite or hackneyed
or you're not just doing yet another -- who needs another song about
relationships? It took us a while to get the right mood, and I was really
happy with the mood we ended up with in the verses, and I think, oddly enough,
as much as it was a nightmare, that song for me, when I hear the record now, I
think the verses are one of the strongest parts of the album, in that song. <P> 

AL: Yeah, I think there's a great balance between the romantic picture on the
one side, and how the music is sympathetic to those lyrics, and then the other
point of view, which is much colder ...<P> 

GL: Much tougher.  <P> 

AL: ... more based in reality. And the contrast between the lyrics and the   
music, and how they support each other, I think really worked out successfully
on that song, from what Ged said was a very difficult song for us to work on.

<strong>Neil Peart (<a href="../HTML/articles/network1193.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/network1193.html">Network Magazine, November 1993</a>): </strong>
"In 'Cold Fire' I have the woman speaking to the man and she's smarter than 
he is. It was a difficult technical challenge lyrically, but those are the 
kind of things that now, after all these years, you start to feel you have 
the craft to take on. I don't mind writing about love now, where I would 
have avoided that in the previous years just because of the inability to get 
beyond cliches."

Cold Fire
---- ----
It was long after midnight 
When we got to unconditional love
She said sure, my heart is boundless
But don't push my limits too far

I said if love was so transcendant
I don't understand these boundaries
She said just don't disappoint me --
You know how complex women are
I'll be around 
If you don't let me down 
Too far

It was just before sunrise 
When we started on traditional roles
She said sure I'll be your partner
But don't make too many demands

I said if love has these conditions
I don't understand those songs you love
She said this is not a love song
This isn't fantasy-land
I'll be around 
If you don't push me down 
Too far

DON'T GO TOO FAR --
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea 
Is a cold fire
DON'T CROSS THE LINE --
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor                              
Is a cold fire
DON'T LET ME DOWN --
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond 
Is a cold fire
DON'T BREAK THE SPELL --
The look in your eyes as you head for the door 
Is a cold fire

Love is blind if you are gentle
Love can turn to a long, cold burn

Everyday Glory
-------- -----
In the house where nobody laughs 
And nobody sleeps
In the house where love lies dying 
And the shadows creep
A little girl hides, shaking,
With her hands on her ears
Pushing back the tears, 'til the pain disappears

Mama says some ugly words
Daddy pounds the wall
They can fight about their little girl later
Right now they don't care at all
No matter what they say...
No matter what they say...

EVERYDAY PEOPLE
EVERYDAY SHAME
EVERYDAY PROMISE
SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES

EVERYDAY SUNRISE
ANOTHER EVERYDAY STORY
RISE FROM THE ASHES --
A BLAZE OF EVERYDAY GLORY

In the city where nobody smiles
And nobody dreams
In the city where desperation 
Drives the bored to extremes

Just one spark of decency 
Against a starless night
One glow of hope and dignity
A child can follow the light
No matter what they say
No matter what they say...

If the future's looking dark
We're the ones who have to shine
If there's no one in control
We're the ones who draw the line
Though we live in trying times --
We're the ones who have to try
Though we know that time has wings --
We're the ones who have to fly
