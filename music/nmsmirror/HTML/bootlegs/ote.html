This double boot contains the entire Roll the Bones show. It has superb sound
quality, a decent-looking booklet, and as a bonus, a very strange conversation
Alex had with himself during "Closer to the Heart".<p>

For quite a while the exact date of this show was a mystery. Many thought it
was the Holland show, but this show is definitely from Stuttgart (someone
"in the know" told me).
The reason for this mystery is rather annoying --
the company that put this out cut out the section where Geddy says hello to
the city that they happen to be in. The cut itself is hard to hear, but there 
is a good chunk of talk missing. However, one clue is that you do hear him 
speak German later in the show.<p>

Soundwise, the show is nearly flawless. This almost could be from a
soundboard, except for the annoying clapping at the beginning of some of the
first songs. The band sounds a little distant, but for the most part much
louder than the audience.<p>

The booklet has some wonderful pictures taken during the RTB tour, but
unfortunately they have enormous purple dice coving up part of every one. The
discs are picture discs of more purple dice. The only mislabelled song is
"Distant Early Warning", mistakenly put down as "Red Sector A".<p>

A very decent CD of the RTB tour, well worth the money. If you like Alex, dice
and German, this is the one for you!<p>
