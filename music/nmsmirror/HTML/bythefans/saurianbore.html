You and I, we don't see what all the hype's about--<br>
He sings and he dances, he laughs like a fool.<br>
They're on the pledge drive, begging for more,<br>
Schmoozing for the Saurian Bore.<p>

You and I, we're appalled by the inanity...<br>
He's purple and bloated, insipid and dull.<br>
Enslaving children's minds by the score,<br>
They're powerless to the Saurian Bore.<p>

For you and me<br>
For you and me, we say this without inhibition<br>
For you and me, Barney's death is what we're wishin'<br>
For you and me, we agree...<p>

You and I, we watch without understanding<br>
His voice is annoying, his costume is crude.<br>
His quick demise is what we'd like to see<br>
No more "I love you," no more "You love me."<p>

For you and me, Barn's appeal is just a mystery<br>
For you and me, we'd like to make him ancient history<br>
For you and me, we agree<p>

They're preaching for the Saurian Bore<br>
Beseeching for the Saurian Bore<br>
We're aiming for the Saurian Bore...<p>

You and I, we abhor this purple dinosaur<br>
He's corrupting our children for his own evil ends.<br>
Enthralling minds is what he's out to do,<br>
urning kids' brains into goo.<p>

For you and me, the end of Barney is our mission<br>
For you and me, a putrid purple prohibition.<br>
For you and me, we know the truth and won't keep quiet<br>
For you and me, the Purple One's a merchandising giant<br>
For you and me, we do agree<br>
       (and it's not just us)<p>

Searching for the Saurian Bore<br>
     (It's not just us)<br>
Aiming for the Saurian Bore<br>
     (It's not just us)<br>
Rubbing out the Saurian Bore<br>
     (Hooray for us!)<p>
