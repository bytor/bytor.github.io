Flat Tire<br>
It's a flat tire<p>

It was just after midnight<br>
When my pickup truck started to heave<br>
She said "You had to buy the retreads"<br>
"Now they won't take us too far"<p>

I said "If we weren't so dependant"<br>
"On this pickup truck from hell"<br>
She said "Just go change the tire"<br>
"I hope you have a useful spare"<br>
Down on the ground<br>
Don't let the truck fall down<br>
On me<p>

It was just before sunrise
When the pickup finally started to roll<br>
She said "Boy that took a long time"<br>
"I just want to go home"<p>

I said "If you can't keep your mouth shut"<br>
"You'll be walking home you bitch"<br>
She said "I'll say what I want to"<br>
"Now get the truck in gear"<br>
Down on the ground<br>
Don't let the truck fall down<br>
On me<p>

WON'T GO TOO FAR --<br>
There must have been a nail on that old back road<br>
It's a flat tire<br>
THIS TRUCK IS MINE --<br>
Some shattered glass in the parking lot<br>
It's a flat tire<br>
DOWN ON THE GROUND --<br>
It must have been punctured when we left the bar<br>
It's a flat tire<br>
THE TRUCK FROM HELL --<br>
This wouldn't have happened if we weren't so poor<br>
It's a flat tire<p>

Tires last if you are gentle.<br>
Flats can lead to a long, cold ride.<p>
