<font size=+1>Rush rules again in '90s suburbia</font><br>
<b>by Steve Crawford</b><p>

In the realm of '80s suburbia, dude, Rush ruled.<p>

Sure, you had Van Halen for partyin'.  You had Journey for
makin' out.  Rush is what you had for those all night rap sessions.<p>

Rush is what you listened to in your car when you were
trying to escape the Fascist Establishment (i.e. your parents).
It's what you listened to when you played Dungeons & Dragons.<p>

The '80s, of course, are gone.  Rock has splintered into a
million musical shards.  Rock gods such the Rush trio of Geddy Lee,
Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart no longer roam the Earth with impunity
as they did a decade ago.<p>

But while other '80s acts burned out or faded away, Rush
keeps chugging along, releasing a new album and touring every other
year or so.<p>

And the fans keep showing up.  The Cynthia Woods Mitchell
Pavilion was packed with the faithful of all ages Sunday night.  What
they wanted, Rush delivered -- for better and worse.<p>

The band played two sets on a nicely uncluttered stage set --
a few icons from the artwork on its new album, Test for Echo, and a
large video screen that offered a mix of arty clips and live shots
of the band.  The first set was a tight, professional affair
highlighted by Lee's nimble bass lines and Peart's muscular drumming.<p>

Between-songs chatter was kept to a bare but friendly minimum.
That's one of the pleasures of the band:  These guys have been around
so long that they seem like old friends you'd invite over for a beer
and a hockey game.<p>

There was a number of obligatory cuts from the new album,
including Driven and Half the World.  The new album is rather airless
and bland, but in concert the band played these songs with substantial
power.<p>

And there was a little raw meat for the crowd -- in other words,
a few of the band's classic hits:  Limelight, The Trees, Red Barchetta,
Closer to the Heart and a suite of songs from 2112, the most Spinal
Tap-pish of Rush's albums.<p>

The second set was strictly for the fans, which turned out to
be a double-edged sword.  Bathed in the sheen of an entertaining light
show, the band happily delivered classic cuts from its immense catalog.
But lurking in the background was the crowd's anticipation of a jam
session complete with bass, guitar and -- gulp -- drum solos.<p>

Of course, Rush gave the fans what they wanted with an
interminable interlude of the kind of jazzy prog-rock self-indulgence
that spawned the opposite and equal reaction known as punk rock.<p>

And the crowd ate it up.  By the time Rush closed with all-time
faves The Spirit of Radio and Tom Sawyer and an encore of YYZ, devotees
were sated and it was clear why Rush has been around so long:  These
guys are consummate professionals.  They show up on time, they play
hard and well, and they don't begrudge the audience its old favorites.<p>

They have a good time, and they deliver a good time.  They don't
condescend or pander (well, not too much).  What more can you ask of
your aging rock gods?<p>
