This is one of the many CD boots from the Counterparts tour, and it like most
of them is sorely lacking in sound quality. It most resembles listening to a
television show from several houses away; very distant and muffled, and the
bass hard to hear. The crowd is at times clearer than the music!<p>

One odd thing is that the encore for the show is much clearer and louder than
the rest of the concert, much like the mic was taken out of a coat pocket. If
the rest of the show sounded like the encore, this would've been a real
winner.<p>

The booklet has some very nice pictures of Rush from the CP tour in full
color, and the discs themselves are picture discs: one of Alex, one of Geddy.
The back insert has an excellent picture of Neil (where else?) behind 
his drumkit. And although the back only lists "YYZ", it does contain the full
encore.<p>

If you simply MUST have this show on CD, then buy it. Otherwise, I would
suggest finding this particular show on tape (from a different source if
possible) if you want it.<p>
