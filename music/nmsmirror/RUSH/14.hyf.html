<font size=+1><strong>On the Cover of Hold Your Fire</font></strong><br><br>
<strong><dd>Geddy Lee ("Rockline", Oct 5 1987): </strong>
"It's so difficult to describe the album cover because you want to
leave a little bit of mystery, and you want it to be interpreted by
the person who is holding the thing in front of them.  So I'm really
not going to say too much about what the cover says to me, but it's
nothing extremely mystical or anything.  It has nothing to do with
brown rice." <p>

<strong>Geddy Lee (Only Music, December 1987): </strong>
"It's an abstraction that can be taken in so many different ways. Basically, 
you get a good feeling about the artwork, there's something that clicks about 
it.  The three balls, geometrically and physically create a tension in the 
way they're suspended.  They relate to the balls of fire, as it relates to 
holding your creative fires.  It's all a play on those thoughts and everything 
associated with them.  Sure, you can look at it as three people, three balls, 
but it's all that and more."<p>

<dd><strong>Geddy Lee ("Rockline", Oct 5 1987): </strong>
"It was more or less an afterthought in the writing stage.  We took
two months to do all of our writing and preproduction, you know,
preparation for the making of the record, and we had nine songs, and
we had about a day and a half left of time booked before we were
supposed to leave and get ready to make the record.  And our producer
and all of us were pushing for ten tracks on the album, and some
lyrics had been submitted to us by a friend of ours, Pye Dubois, who
co-wrote 'Tom Sawyer' with us in years gone by.  And Neil was able to
put some of his own thoughts to one of the songs that he had and
present it to us in the morning of the last day that we were there,
and we loved the results, so we got together and brainstormed for
about 2 or 3 hours, and we had Force Ten."

<dl>
<font size=+1><strong>The writing process behind "Force Ten":</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>From Only Music, December 1987: </strong>
Force Ten was the first single released from Hold Your Fire, and was
ironically the last song written on the Album.  Pye co-wrote the lyrics with
Neil.  "He played with it a bit until he was happy with the result and showed 
it to us.  At the time we had nine songs and wanted to get ten tracks on the 
record.  Peter felt we really need one more rock song, so when these lyrics 
came by, we were excited about it." <P>

"We wrote 'Force Ten' one afternoon in three hours," says Lee.  "Those songs 
to me are always my favorite because they are spontaneous and fresh.  It 
gives the album more variety and balance." <P>

<strong>Neil Peart (1988): </strong>
"The song expresses ways to face barriers and urges people not to be afraid
of failure - one of our basic temperamental traits."

<font size=+1><strong>Geddy on the bass sound in Force Ten:</font></strong>
<br><br>
<dl>
<em><dd>
On "Force Ten" [from <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>] you do some chordal stuff on bass.  
What were you thinking of then?  It really pushes the tune ahead.</em> <P>

<strong>Geddy Lee (<a href="../HTML/articles/bp1288.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/bp1288.html">Bass Player, 
Nov/Dec 1988</a>): </strong>
"Before I had a visit from Jeff Berlin, who's a friend, on the tour I had the 
opportunity to watch him goofing around backstage with a bass, and was just 
amazed at his knowledge of bass chords.  That's something I had never really 
exploited in my playing, so he inspired me to play around more with it.  He
probably doesn't know it, and would be embarrassed to hear it.  I ended up 
using bass chords on "Force Ten" and "Turn The Page".  Not so much in the 
sense of strumming them as using my thumb more, almost like a fingerpicking 
style of playing, which is something that I'm still working on.  Just plucking 
with my thumb and going back and forth between the thumb and the first two 
fingers and pulling.  Almost like a snapping technique.  It's opened up a bit
more range for me.  There's more melodic possibilities and rhythmic 
possibilities too, which is an important role for the bass player.  If you can 
establish not only a melody but a rhythmic feel, that's an extra tool."

<strong>Alex Lifeson (Guitar magazine, August 1988): </strong>
"For some of the things Andy Richards, a keyboard player who does some 
session work and helps with programming and playing, will come up with these 
ridiculous like with "Force Ten" as an example.  He had a sample of a jack 
hammer and it was really effective for the song.  It's fun to intro things 
a little differently, a little bent."

Force Ten
----- ---
Tough times demand tough talk
demand tough hearts demand tough songs
demand --

We can rise and fall like empires
Flow in and out like the tide
Be vain and smart, humble and dumb
We can hit and miss like pride

We can circle around like hurricanes
Dance and dream like lovers
Attack the day like birds of prey
Or scavengers under cover

Look in -- to the eye of the storm
Look out -- for the force without form
Look around -- at the sight and the sound
Look in look out look around --

We can move with savage grace
To the rhythms of the night
Cool and remote like dancing girls
In the heat of the beat and the lights

We can wear the rose of romance
An air of joie de vivre
Too-tender hearts upon our sleeves
Or skin as thick as thieves'

rising falling at force ten
we twist the world and ride the wind

Look in -- look the storm in the eye
Look out -- to the sea and the sky
Look around -- at the sight and the sound
Look in look out look around --

How did Aimee Mann ('til Tuesday) come to sing on this song?</em><p>
<strong>Geddy Lee (1988): </strong>
"We knew that the part she sings on was a feminine part.  We didn't want to 
use a keyboard or have Alex or myself sing it, so we started looking for a 
female singer.  It's a very attractive opportunity for us to work with a 
female singer.  We just looked until we found a voice, that was suitable.  In
listening to Aimee's last record, we loved the way she sang, so we just asked
her."

<font size=+1><strong>The first song Neil wrote:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Neil Peart (1988): </strong>
"My first idea was to write about time and the first song I wrote
was 'Time Stand Still'. But the more I thought about it and
played around with the ideas, the more expanded idea of
temperamental barriers took shape. 'Time Stand Still' applies to
that concept in that it deals with the attitude of enjoying life
and not letting it whisk by without appreciating it."

Time Stand Still
---- ----- -----
I turn my back to the wind
To catch my breath,
Before I start off again.
Driven on without a moment to spend
To pass an evening with a drink and a friend

I let my skin get too thin
I'd like to pause.
No matter what I pretend
Like some pilgrim --
Who learns to transcend --
Learns to live
As if each step was the end

Time stand still -- I'm not looking back
But I want to look around me now
See more of the people and the places that surround me now

Freeze this moment a little bit longer
Make each sensation a little bit stronger
Experience slips away...

I turn my face to the sun
Close my eyes.
Let my defences down --
All those wounds that I can't get unwound

I let my past go too fast
No time to pause --
If I could slow it all down
Like some captain, whose ship runs aground --
I can wait until the tide comes around

Make each impression a little bit stronger
Freeze this motion a little bit longer
The innocence slips away...

Summer's going fast, nights growing colder
Children growing up -- old friends growing colder
Experience slips away...

<font size=+1><strong>Behind "Open Secrets": </strong></font><br><br>
<dd>
<em>
"Open Secrets" stemmed from a conversation between Peart and Lee
about people they knew and how they went through life without
properly addressing problems that were affecting them.</em><p>

<strong>Neil Peart (1988): </strong>
"Quite a lot of my ideas come from having conversations with
other people. I take their observations and viewpoints and
personalize them. Unfortunately a lot of people think these songs
are personal statements. I don't want that to happen because it
would seem I'm unburdening myself and that would be tiresome."

<font size=+1><strong>Geddy on the song:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><em>
At the end of "Open Secrets" [from <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>] it
sounds like you guys are jamming, almost an improvised thing.</em> <P>

<strong>Geddy Lee (<a href="../HTML/articles/bp1288.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/bp1288.html">Bass Player, 
Nov/Dec 1988</a>): </strong>
"It sort of was.  That song went through a lot of changes, and by the end of 
it, we had established this bass riff near the top of it.  At the end we got 
into this groove when we were in the demo stage that we knew would be fun.  
So when Neil locked into that groove and went with it, he felt so good that 
we just let him go.  And I just jammed to what he already put down."

<font size=+1><strong>Alex on the solo in the song:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><em>
What is your attitude about solos?  Do  yours have anything to do with lyric 
or the melody?</em> <P>

<strong>Alex Lifeson (Guitar magazine, August 1988): </strong>
"It's more the musicality of the song than the lyrical content.  For the
solo I think it's the mood that's created by the music.  I suppose in a way
that makes it attached to the lyrics.  But it's more the music that
provides the trigger for what the solo does.  If it's a dark, melancholy sound 
to that particular song, then the solo will reflect that.  An example is "Open
Secrets."  It has that lonely mood to it from a musical point of view.  I
thinkthe solo in that song reflects that wailing loneliness.  Something like
"Turn the Page" is much more manic and crazy.  <P>

<em>
Do you have a favorite track on the record for vision versus execution?</em><P>

"Probably "Mission" and "Open Secrets."  "Mission" came out a lot better
than I thought it would.  It had gone through quite a few changes since its
inception and it ended up being a much better song than it started out."

Open Secrets
---- -------
It went right by me --
At the time it went over my head
I was looking out the window
I should have looked at your face instead

It went right by me --
Just another wall
There should have been a moment
When we let our barriers fall
I never meant what you're thinking --
That is not what I meant at all...

Well I guess we all have these feelings
We can't leave unreconciled
Some of them burned on our ceilings
Some of them learned as a child

The things that we're concealing
Will never let us grow
Time will do its healing
You've got to let it go

Closed for my protection --
Open to your scorn
Between these two directions
My heart is sometimes torn

I lie awake with my secrets
spinning around my head
something that somehow escaped me --
Something you shouldn't have said
I was looking out the window
I should have looked at your face instead...

I find no absolution
In my rational point of view
Maybe some things are instinctive
But there's one thing you could do
You could try to understand me --
I could try to understand you...

<strong>Geddy Lee (<a href="../HTML/articles/bp1288.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/bp1288.html">Bass Player,

"We obviously have a chordal structure, and a melodic fix or picture of what 
the part's going to be.  Usually I put it down, and between Neil and myself, 
we get little rhythm patterns going.  I play around with the melody, and 
depending on what the tone center is and what the chord structures are in that 
area, I just write my part.  Then Alex plays different solos around what Neil
and I have already put down.  He's quite content to work with what we've put 
down, and in most parts he's around through every stage anyway, so he's quite 
aware of the direction it's going in.  He'll go down and wail, and a lot of 
times he will surprise us.  It's a totally different direction than we had 
expected it, but it's always within the melodic structure that exists."

Prime Mover
----- -----
Basic elemental instinct to survive
Stirs the higher passions
Thrill to be alive

Alternating currents in a tidewater surge
Rational resistance to an unwise urge
(anything can happen)

From the point of conception
To the moment of Truth
At the point of surrender
To the burden of proof

From the point of ignition
To the final drive
The point of the journey is not to arrive
(anything can happen)

Basic temperamental filters on our eyes
Alter our perceptions
Lenses polarize

Alternating currents force a show of hands
Rational responses force a change of plans
(anything can happen)

From a point on the compass
To magnetic north
The point of the needle moving back and forth

From the point of entry --
Until the candle is burned
The point of departure is not to return
(anything can happen)

I set the wheels in motion
turn up all the machines
activate the programs
and run behind the scene

I set the clouds in motion
turn up light and sound
activate the window
and watch the world go 'round --

<dl>
<font size=+1><strong>Neil on the message of "Second
Nature":</font></strong><br><br>
<dd>
<strong>From 1988: </strong>
"Second Nature" is conciliatory in its message: If we can't reach
perfection in this world then let's at least settle for some
degree of improvement. "Sometimes we have to accept something
less than total victory," notes Peart. "It's like the difference
between compromise and balance. The politician who campaigns for
clean air but doesn't want to close down the stinking factory in
his area because thousands of people will lose their jobs. My
viewpoint is that I'll take as much as I can without hurting
other people."

<PRE>
Second Nature
------ ------
A memo to a higher office
Open letter to the powers-that-be
To a God, a king, a head of state
A captain of industry
To the movers and the shakers --
Can't everybody see?

It ought to be second nature --
I mean, the places where we live!
Let's talk about this sensibly --
We're not insensitive
I know progress has no patience --
But something's got to give

I know you're different --
You know I'm the same
We're both too busy
To be taking the blame
I'd like some changes
But you don't have the time
We can't go on thinking
It's a victimless crime
No one is blameless
But we're all without shame
We fight the fire -- while we're feeding the flames

Folks have got to make choices --
And choices got to have voices
Folks are basically decent
Conventional wisdom would say
Well, we read about the exceptions
In the papers every day

It ought to be second nature --
At least, that's what I feel
"Now I lay me down in Dreamland" --
I know perfect's not for real
I thought we might get closer --
But I'm ready to make a deal

Today is different, and tomorrow the same
It's hard to take the world the way that it came
Too many rapids keep us sweeping along
Too many captains keep on steering us wrong
It's hard to take the heat --
It's hard to lay blame
To fight the fire -- while we're feeding the flames

There's one section on "Lock And Key" where you get a good trebly effect.  I 
know you used Rickenbackers in the past,and that sound reminds me of it.

<strong>Geddy Lee (<a href="../HTML/articles/bp1288.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/bp1288.html">Bass Player, 
Nov/Dec 1988</a>): </strong>
"You can get that sound out of most basses I think, but a Rickenbacker has a 
particular kind of top end, and bottom end as well.  It has a particular kind 
of classic twang to it.  I found that I wanted to get a little more subtlety 
in the sound, and I couldn't quite get it out of the Rick.  I wanted to change 
the top end a little bit, get a little different shaped bottom end.  Then I 
moved to a Steinberger, which really gave me a totally different sound.  The 
top end didn't range as high and twangy, and the bottom end was quite a 
different shade.  I liked it a lot, and used it onstage, and 
on the <strong>Grace 
Under Pressure</strong> album.  But on <strong>Power Windows</strong> I got 
introduced to the Wal 
bass, made by a small company in England.  Our producer, Peter Collins, had 
one and suggested I try it out.  I used that 
bass on </strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>, and
I'm very pleased with the results and its flexibility.  I use a 4-string most 
of the time, but on "Lock And Key" it was a 5-string they made with an extra 
low "B".  I find that low string really means more today, because we're living 
in the world of synthesizers that go lower than basses ever went before."

Lock And Key
---- --- ---
I don't want to face the killer instinct --
Face it in your or me

We carry a sensitive cargo
Below the waterline --
Ticking like a time bomb
With a primitive design

Behind the finer feelings --
This civilized veneer --
The heart of a lonely hunter
Guards a dangerous frontier

The balance can sometimes fail --
Strong emotions can tip the scale --

Don't want to silence a desperate voice
For the sake of security
No one wants to make a terrible choice
On the price of being free
I don't want to face the killer instinct -- face it in you or me
So we keep it under lock and key...

It's not a matter of mercy
It's not a matter of laws
Plenty of people will kill you for some fanatical cause

It's not a matter of conscience --
A search for probable cause
It's just a matter of instinct -- a matter of fatal flaws

No reward for resistance
No assistance -- no applause...

we don't want to be victims
on that we all agree, so we lock up the killer instinct --
and throw away the key...

<font size=+1><strong>Geddy on the meaning behind Mission:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Geddy Lee (1988): </strong>
        "Mission," one of the strongest cuts on the new album, has an
underlying philosophy behind it.  "It basically grew out of a conversation
Neil and I had about the kind of people we consider ourselves to be, people who
always knew what they wanted to do in their lives and always had this ambition
and desire, but couldn't make a choice as to what to do.  It was always very
clear that we had to do what we do - whether we were a success or a failure -
we knew we would always play music in some way.  'Mission' also looks sadly at
the people who have never really been sure what they should be doing and have
never had a clearcut idea where to put their creative ability to [reach] a
final, ultimate conclusion," notes Lee.

Mission
-------
Hold your fire --
Keep it burning bright
Hold the flame 'til the dream ignites --
A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission

I hear their passionate music
Read the words that touch my heart
I gaze at their feverish pictures
The secrets that set them apart

When I feel the powerful visions
Their fire has made alive
I wish I had that instinct -- I wish I had that drive

Spirits fly on dangerous missions
Imaginations on fire
Focused high on soaring ambitions
Consumed in a single desire

In the grip of a nameless possession --
A slave to the drive of obsession --
A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission...

I watch their images flicker
Bringing light to a lifeless screen
I walk through their beautiful buildings
And I wish I had their dreams

But dreams don't need to have motion
To keep their spark alive
Obsession has to have action --
Pride turns on the drive

It's cold comfort
To the ones without it
To know how they struggled --
How they suffered about it

If their lives were exotic and strange
They would likely have gladly exchanged them
For something a little more plain
Maybe something a little more sane

We each pay a fabulous price
For our visions of paradise
But a spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission...

difficulties:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>From Guitar World (March 1990): </strong>
"Certain songs are a breeze," he explains.
"They just click.  Though I record the bass and vocal tracks separately, I
can put the two together quite easily.  There are certain songs, though,
like 'The Page' (from <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>) that are just 
ridiculous to pull off
live because the two parts have nothing to do with each other.  So I really
have to practice a lot to get something like that down.  There's usually a
way of feeling them together.  It's a process of splitting yourself, really,
I'd love to know how that works, but I just know that it does, eventually, I
guess it's like sports-muscle memory, where the body is moving in all
differentdirections and yet all the muscles know what they're supposed to be
doing...like a dancer or an athlete."

Nothing can survive in a vacuum
No one can exists all alone
We pretend things only happen to strangers
We've all got problems of our own

It's enough to learn to share our pleasures
We can't sooth pain with sympathy
All that we can do is be reminded --
We shake our heads at the tragedy

Every day we're standing in a time capsule
Racing down a river from the past
Every day we're standing in a wind tunnel
Facing down the future coming fast

It's just the age
It's just a stage --
We disengage -- We turn the page...

Looking at the long-range forecast
Catching all the names in the news
Checking out the state of the nation
Learning the environmental blues

Truth is after all a moving target
Hairs to split, and pieces that don't fit
How can anybody be enlightened?
Truth is after all so poorly lit

<font size=+1><strong>The meaning of "Tai Shan":</font></strong><br><br>
<dd>
<strong>From the Rush FAQ: </strong>
"Tai' Shan" (from </strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>) is the name of an actual "holy mountain"
in China.  The mythical (?) emperor Huang Ti had so much power that he
was able to summon all the spirits of the world to him on top of
Tai' Shan to proclaim his power.  <P>

Legend has it that if you climb to the top of this mountain and
"raise your hands to heaven," you <strong>will</strong> live to be at least 100
years old.  Neil wrote these lyrics while sitting at the top of
the mountain.

Tai Shan
--- ----
High on the sacred mountain
Up the seven thousand stairs
In the golden light of autumn
There was magic in the air

Clouds surrounded the summit
The wind blew strong and cold
Among the silent temples
And the writing carved in gold
Somewhere in my instincts
The primitive took hold...

I stood at the top of the mountain
And China sang to me
In the peaceful haze of harvest time
A song of eternity --

If you raise your hands to heaven
You will live a hundred years
I stood there like a mystic
Lost in the atmosphere

The clouds were suddenly parted
For a moment I could see
The patterns of the landscape
Reaching to the eastern sea
I looked upon a presence
Spanning forty centuries...

I thought of time and distance
The hardships of history
I heard the hope and the hunger
When China sang to me...

<font size=+1><strong>Neil discusses "High Water"'s meanings:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><em>
This is a song that addresses man's primal connection with water.</em> <P>

<strong>Neil Peart (1988): </strong>
"I always feel comfortable when I'm near water, be it the sound of the ocean 
or even the refreshing feeling od a dip in the swimming pool.  I remember 
being in the center of one of Japan's biggest cities and the noise pollution 
was incredible.  But right in the middle was this garden with a small waterfall
that ran over a bunch of stones. It was designed in such a way that if you sat 
by the waterfall, the sound of water would drown out all the surrounding 
noises. I think the Japanese understand the therapeutic nature of water better 
than most."

High Water
---- -----
When the waters rose in the darkness
In the wake of the endless flood
It flowed into our memory -- it flowed into our blood

When something broke the surface
Just to see the starry dome --
We still feel that relation
When the water takes us home
In the flying spray of the ocean
The water takes you home --

Springing from the weight of the mountains
Like the heart of the earth would burst
Flowing out from marble fountains
In the dreams of a desert thirst

Something swam through the jungles
Where the mighty rivers roam --
Something breaks the silence
When the water takes you home
I hear the wordless voices
When the water takes me home --

Waves that crash on the shoreline
Torrents of tropical rain streaming down
Beyond our memory
Streaming down inside our veins

When something left the ocean
To crawl high above the foam --
We still feel that elation
When the water takes us home
In a driving rain of redemption
The water takes me home...
