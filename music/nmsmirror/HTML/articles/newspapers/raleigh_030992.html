Chapel Hill -- Rush's career stands as living proof that
any band really can have it all, provided they stick with it long enough.  <p>

For most of its existence, Rush has been a crowd-pleasing whipping boy for
critics. But recent years have found this Canadian trio attaining a measure
of hipness. With every metal band from Metallidca on down citing Rush as an
influence, the band's last few albums have actually earned decent reviews.  <p>

But if it has taken the critics the better part of 20 years to catch on,
the little boys have always understood. Combining world-class musicianship
with quasi-profound dabblings in science-fiction themes of alienation and
individualism, Rush has earned a fanatical following among multiple
generations of sullen teenagers.  <p>

Really, though, the band's literary trappings have always been beside the
point, because Rush's songs are actually about "Arena Rock." Rush
represents the pinnacle of formalism with a conceptual stage show whose
main theme is "Rock Stardom." <p>

A Rush show is the rock world's closest approximation of a classical music
recital, which has nothing to do with the band's chops (ample though they
are). Rather, it has to do with the band's precise recapitulation of an
accepted cannon of songs. There is, of course, an element of ritual to
every established band's concerts. But few bands have the shtick down as
well as these consummate technocrats.  <p>

Playing to an enthusiastic crowd of about 14,000 at Chapel Hill's Smith
Center Saturday night, Rush demonstrated an absolute command of the
arena-rock medium. Every last flourish -- drum Neil Peart's drumstick
tosses, singer-bassist Geddy Lee's swagger and guitarist Alex Lifeson's
solos -- was flawlessly rendered.  <p>

The show's pace was letter-perfect, too, starting with several better-known
songs (most notably "Limelight" and "Freewill"). Then came an interlude of
more recent material, including a number of songs (some quite forgettable)
from Rush's current "Roll the Bones" album.  <p>

Just as the crowd's interest level was flagging, Peart won back the
attention with the inevitable drum solo, which he concluded by banging a
gong. The band finished up with the fist-waving anthems everybody had come
to see, encoring with "The Spirit of Radio." <p>

Spectacular special effects -- including strobe lights and lasers forming
various geometric shapes -- accompanied the music. A video screen at the
back of the stage provided visual cues to tie different segments of the
show together -- snippets of videos, album cover graphics and cartoon
figures mimicking the band's performance of instrumental passages.  <p>

The most memorable props were two 20-foot tall inflatable rabbits, which
appeared out of huge top hats onstage and bopped to the beat of "Tom
Sawyer." For a band not known for its sense of humor, this was a nice
touch.  <p>

Opening act Primus, an inexplicably popular faux funk trio from San
Francisco, started the evening off with a mercifully brief 35-minute set.
Primus is one of the current darlings of the alternative scene, largely on
the reputation of bassist Les Claypool.  <p>

From a purely technical standpoint, Claypool's virtuosity can't be faulted.
But that doesn't change the fact that Primus couldn't find a melody unless
it was attached to a leash. Instead of tunes, the band's songs consisted of
interminable jams with lots of stop/start tempo changes.
