<font size=+1>Rush scissors new rock sounds</font><br>
<b>By Paul Robicheau</b><p>

Neil Peart likens music-making to working with stone, paper and scissors. The
stone stands for the playing. The stone is then wrapped in paper, which
represents the song. Scissors cut the paper, forming the arrangement, and
completing the metaphor. How does Rush approach this basic recycling process?
"We like pushing the outside of the envelope," the drummer-lyricist says.
Indeed, in the 16 years since Rush first emerged from the Toronto bar circuit,
the Canadian power trio has wielded more scissors than Peart has drums in his
fortress-styled double kit.<p>

Some people still think of Rush as a metal band, an image grounded in the
group's mid-'70s tenure as a skewed offspring of Led Zeppelin propelled by
singer Geddy Lee's then-screechy howl. Yet the late '70s found the trio
indulging in eclectic, textural excursions that recalled the English art-rock
movement.<p>

Reggae flirtations a la the Police filtered in during the early '80s, before
Rush delved into a more synthesizer-groomed sound. Today, "Presto," the band's
latest album, sees guitarist Alex Lifeson's squealing licks and power chords
returning to a primary role.<p>

"We've kind of made that highway for ourselves," Peart says about his group's
anomalous position in the arena rock world. "Essentially I see us as a
polyglot of all those things."<p>

"We've been fortunate that rock has changed so much in the last 15 years, that
it has allowed us to have fresh influences all the time," Peart says, on the
phone from an Atlanta tour stop, on the way to shows in the Centrum tonight
and tomorrow.<p>

"All that stuff was interesting to us, just as music fans, and consequently
tended to creep into the music," he says. "I had always been interested in
reggae -- long before white people made it homogeneous -- and the same with
African music. Long before 'world music,' I was very intrigued by African
music, especially West African modern pop. So, to me, it was already a part of
my influences. When it became a part of pop music in general, it somehow
became easier to incorporate."<p>

Known for taking adventurous vacations -- he once climbed Mount Kilimanjaro --
Peart went to West African during a six-month break before Rush made "Presto."
"I was bicycling around Togo and Ghana, and the Ivory Coast, and I got to sit
in with a troupe of Togolese drummers."<p>

Not that "Presto" is at all like a "Graceland" for Rush. But then, the
serious-on-the-surface band has its subtle in-jokes, even in a steamlined
riff-rocker like "Superconductor."<p>

"One of the musical puns in the middle, in the instrumental section, is
actually a West African pop beat I heard constantly while I was there," Peart
says. "That part was mapped out as a string solo, and Geddy worked out an
almost ska bass pattern over it. It was a marriage of such disparate elements,
but one of the things we have learned over the years is how to do that. We
used to try to do it, and it would come across like three pieces stuck
together and we didn't know how to glue it yet."<p>

Helping Rush with the scissors and glue for "Presto" was Rupert Hine, a
keyboardist-producer known for his slick work with the Fixx and Tina Turner.
Hine would seem to be an odd choice as co-producer for an album marking a
slant back to guitar and, for Lee, priority to bass over keyboards.<p>

However, Peart says, "While the shift in focus was there, there are still no
fewer keyboards in there... Rupert was tired of working with machines, and
with nothing but keyboards and sequencers. So he was ready for a more organic
approach."<p>

An organic approach isn't what one would normally expect from chronic
perfectionists like Rush -- who took more than six weeks to rehearse their
musical assignments for the current tour. As in the past, Rush weighed the
idea of adding a keyboardist or even a singer, as Lee recorded more backing
choruses on the new album. But they decided to remain three-piece, filling out
the sound via pedals, synthesizer patches and electronic drums.<p>

"Just the integrity of the three of us is something we don't want to mess
with," Peart says, "and there's also a certain pride in being a trio and
seeing how much we can do with three sets of hands and feet on stage.<p>

"We've never agreed with the idea of using tapes, but there's so much
available now in digital sampling and sequencing that we can control and
trigger ourselves like we're actually playing them. The pressure is on us to
actually hit these things at the right time, so it never feels like the easy
way out."<p>

New musical tools, nonetheless, did present an easy way out for one Rush
tradition that feel by the wayside during the early '80s: the dual double-neck
guitars Lifeson and Lee once wielded (to striking visual effect) on the 1977
fantasy song "Xanadu."<p>

"It was just a necessary thing because they were so damn heavy," Peart says.
"That's a song, for instance, we have resurrected, but with technology, it's
no longer necessary -- fortunately -- for them to carry those thousand-pound
guitars!"<p>

What does Peart now think of mid-'70s albums like "2112," "A Farewell to
Kings" and "Hemispheres," with their mythological/sci-fi lyrics and loft
arrangements?<p>

"When I look back at that stuff now, I see the flaws very apparently, the
disjointedness of a lot of it, because we hadn't learned a lot about arranging
then," he says. "If your mother drags out your Grade 2 crayon drawings, you're
obviously not going to look at them as the pinnacle of your life."<p>

Nowadays, Rush crafts tighter, punchier tunes like the current hit "Show Don't
Tell," and Peart's lyrics reflect more personal and pressing philosophical
issues. Among other new songs, "The Pass" and "War Paint" explore the folly of
vanity, while "Red tide" addresses the issue of ecology with such lyrics as
"Now's the time to turn the tide, now's the time to fight."<p>

"Even going back to the 'Grace Under Pressure' album, as soon as I started
cleaning off the windows and looking at the world around me, it was something
that demanded to be written about, because it outraged me," he says, wryly
adding, "Now, with Earth Day, I guess I don't have to do that anymore!"<p>

<font size=+1>Rush's playful concert nods to the past</font><br>
<b>By Paul Robicheau</b><p>

WORCESTER -- You can count on certain things at a Rush concert, like
chock-a-block arrangements and a fancy light show. Sometimes, in fact, the
ambitious Canadian power trio's cool, busy delivery cruises into a
self-indulgent blur. You wish they would have rehearsed a month instead of the
craft-crazy six weeks they spent to get their current live set down as a synth
'n' pedal-juggling three-piece, just to loosen up.<p>

But alas, there is also a sense of humor behind those chops, and a shot of
spontaneity between the grooves, as Rush keenly demonstrated at the Centrum
Thursday night for 12,500 fans.<p>

After a solid but autopilot-minded first half that mixed recent hits ("Time
Stand Still," "Show Don't Tell") and old gems ("Free Will", "Red Barchetta"),
Rush literally pulled a rabbit out of a hat to bring its two-hour show to a
peak. Make that two rabbits. In keeping with the cover of the band's new album
"Presto," two inflatable bunnies grew out of tophats on stage, and when they
wiggled and rocked tot he warhorse hit "Tom Sawyer," the spoof on arena-rock
excess was hilarious.<p>

But musically, apart from playful jamming on "Closer to the Heart" and the
finale "In the Mood" (a nod to the band's Toronto bar scene roots), this Rush
was honed for serious execution. In addition to playing old instrumental
showpieces, "YYZ" and "La Villa Strangiato," Rush also dug out ancient fantasy
numbers like "2112" and "Xanadu." The latter's mythological lyrics were a far
cry from the preceding "Manhattan Project," with its atom bomb history lesson.
But those old songs from Rush's hard art-rock period also gave added punch and
dexterity to drummer Neil Peart's clean octopus-like fills, plus a few crying
solos by guitarist Alex Lifeson, who often gets lost in the group's
orchestration.<p>

But even with the nod back to art-rock, Rush didn't speak to its fans with
virtuoso twists alone. New songs "The Pass" and "War Paint," like
"Subdivisions," addressed the peer alienation that faces the suburban males
who are a share of the band's following. "The mirror always lies," bassist
Geddy Lee sang on "War Paint" as a backing film showed a girl and boy in
different guises to underline the folly of vanity.<p>

Opener Mr. Big sunk in the folly of vanity, and even moster bassist Billy
Sheehan couldn't save face. The title to the song "Addicted to That Rush" was
just a funny coincidence. This band lacked Rush's smarts.<p>
