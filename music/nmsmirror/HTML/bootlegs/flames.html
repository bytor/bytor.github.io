<p>
On this double-cd you get a full Roll the Bones show, from the opening notes
of the cartoon to the end of the encore. You also get "The Trees", 
"Vital Signs", and "The Analog Kid", not found on any other RTB CD boot.<p>

The sound is overall slightly distant, but usually the crowd is not overly 
noisy nor
close by the recorder. You can, however, hear a few of them singing parts of
songs ("Limelight" comes to mind), and sometimes talking in the background
(notably "Freewill"). The sound does occasionally vary, as if the 
mics (or recorder) are being moved. The quality is as if you were at a concert
in a large arena, listening to the show yourself.
Some people may find the singing/talking annoying, but that's what happens at
a real concert.<p>

The packaging is adequate, using pictures from the Grace Under Pressure era
rather than more recent shots. The biggest flaw is the mislabelling of songs:
"The Analog Kid" as "Chemistry" & "Distant Early Warning" as "Red Sector A".
"Dreamline" is left off the back listing, but is on the CD.<p>

Overall, a decent CD, not to be missed for "The Analog Kid" or "The Trees". 
If you've got some spare change, by all means grab it!<p>
