<font size=+1>Party atmosphere proves Rush still rocks</font><br>
<b>by CHRIS COBB</b><p>

Aside from the usual crew of head shakers and air thumpers at the front of
the stage, the Rush crowd at the Corel Centre Friday was a quiet,
respectful bunch of people intent on listening rather than using the music
as a background for their own antics. A casual observer might have judged
them to be bored for most of the two-and-a-half hours the Toronto trio was
onstage.<p>

Bored they were not and proof came at the end when most of the 14,000 or
so rose with the house lights. There had not been the usual early gallop to
the parking lot: if the band had played until 2 a.m. -- and they have more
than enough songs to do so -- most everyone would have stayed put.<p>

This was the last date of the Rush Test For Echo tour and there was a
palpable party atmosphere onstage, particularly during the last 30 minutes.
The backstage crew was intent on fun, and frontmen Geddy Lee and Alex
Lifeson were infected too. The end of a tour, and the grind of traveling,
is a joyous occasion, especially for those who work in the shadows.<p>

Rush occupies a unique place in rock. Guitarist Lifeson, bassist-vocalist
Lee and drummer-philosopher prince Neil Peart, have sustained a successful
career, while their English progressive rock counterparts (Yes, Genesis,
Emmerson, Lake and Palmer included) have atrophied. Why? Perhaps it has
something to do with attitude -- and, of course, lots of ear-splitting
noise, eye-popping lights lights and computerized techno wizardry.<p>

The live Rush has moved closer to its audiences over the years and that
has been important to the group's survival. Lee does most of the audience
relations work. Lifeson cruises on the vanity ramps, contorts his face and
shows off his fret work. There's nothing modern about that. Peart, remote
and hard-working, pounds away on his semi-circle of percussion -- the Rush
engine.<p>

As Geddy Lee suggested at the outset, one of the group's challenges is
deciding which of its vast number of songs to play. Doubtless there were
some disappointments at tunes omitted, but the tops of the waves were
touched -- superb versions of Roll The Bones, Nobody's Hero, Closer To The
Heart. Most of the songs were accompanied by excellent videos which were
unfortunately obscured for many on the sides of the arena by hanging light
structures.<p>

Rush isn't, and never has been, above self indulgence, but over 25 years
its audience has grown to tolerate the excesses and the band itself has
tempered its inclination to drift off into obscure musical interludes. Even
Peart's trademark drum solo has developed into something more than an
impressive sounding (though not always impressive) interlude of meandering.
On Friday, it brought him a standing ovation and was the only time during
the evening when the whole audience became obviously animated.<p>

And experience has taught Lee, Peart and Lifeson how to pace a concert to
perfection.<p>

So Rush was hot on Friday: welded as tight as any band currently touring.
For all those who stayed until the lights went up, the traffic jam at the
end of the night was doubtless a small price to pay.<p>
