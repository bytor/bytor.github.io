FOR WHOM THE BUS ROLLS
</font><p>
<em>(A Journal of the Road) </em><br>
<strong>Your Correspondent: Neil Peart</strong>
</center><p>

This journal covers the launching of a tour, the Rush "Moving Pictures" tour 
of 1981, from rehearsals through to the view of a very real world, a day-to-day 
existence for thirty regular people, who just happen to set up and deliver a 
rock show for a living! (It may not be a "real job", but it's certainly a real 
world.)<p>

There is no doubt that it is a strange life; we work, and then drive away 
through the night, while the rest of the world sleeps; we look out the window 
at a different place every day, rootless and unprotected by normality. 
Certainly there is a special state of mind, as I can't even imagine the "on 
the road" feeling, when I'm comfortable nestled at home.  The reverse is also 
true, as I write this from a hotel room, I am hard-pressed to remember what I 
feel like at home.  (maybe I'll just run home and check!)<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Monday, February 9. Toronto.</font></strong> Wait a minute! Are you sure we had a holiday? Oh. 
Anyway, It's back to work. For the past couple of weeks the anticipation has 
been building; practicing, planning, answering the phone, interviews, 
preparing the program, answering the phone, packing, decisions, the phone, et 
cetera.<p>

Here at the rehearsal studio, we will get sore fingers and stiff muscles, 
polishing up both the new and old songs, and putting together a well-paced set. 
To be fair to ourselves, the audience, and our crew, it's desirable to keep the 
show to around two hours, but the eight albums of material to choose from, we 
must be ruthless!<p>

The crew work like elves all around us; hammering, drilling, painting, and 
soldering our gear into shape. Some of it is maintenance, some is modification, 
and some are attempted miracles! Our road manager, Howard, has set up a 
portable office nearby, and is on the phone to all of America: promoters, 
hotels, drivers, sound company, lighting company, other crew members, rigging 
company, the President -- "What do you mean I can't have a nuclear light show?" 
Et cetera.<p>

As Geddy put is so well: "The first day we sound like nothing, the second day 
we sound like someone imitating us; the third day we start to sound like a 
band". Well, almost.<p>

Watching Geddy juggling his bass, synthesizers, pedals, and also the vocals; 
and Alex co-ordinating his settings, echoes, effects, synthesizers, and guitar 
changes, I am inwardly grateful once again that my instrument requires only to 
be hit by a stick!<p>

By the end of the week we are working our way through the two hour show in 
less than four hours. (!) The next step is "Wings Stadium", in Kalamazoo, 
Michigan, where we have hired the hall for four days prior to our first show 
there. We will be doing extensive sound checks, and full production rehearsals.<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Tuesday, February 17. Kalamazoo.</font></strong> 3:00 A.M. The bus has stopped moving, and as 
usual, I sense arrival and wake up. Having slept since we crossed the border, 
I am disoriented at first. Peering out the window of my bunk into a foggy 
oblivion, I can only see the familiar green neon of the "Holiday Inn" sign.
Sigh!<p>

Sleepily, I struggle into coat and shoes, and stumble off of the bus, and into 
the lobby. We meet up with some of the crew who had's been at rehearsals, and 
it's like a family re-union. We collect our keys and rooming lists; and then 
it's open house, doors and suitcases flung open wide, and everyone is wandering 
the halls, visiting from room to identical room. Many of the guys have been 
working over at the hall all night, and are just getting back. Everyone looks 
beat, but glad to be back on the road. Amen!<p>

(later that same day) Awake again, and reaching for the phone with the reflex 
of long habit. Order breakfast, shower, and wait for the rattle of glassware 
that will announce the arrival of the soggy eggs, damp toast, and coffee --
miraculously weak for its bitterness! Et cetera. No surprises.<p>

These reflections are vaporized by the ringing telephone. I generally answer 
the phone with a certain trepidation,, but thankfully it's Rhonda from the 
office, who is always nice to talk with, even when she bears unwelcome 
requests; (last-minute interviews, persistent photographers, messages from 
people on other planets, et cetera). We can usually deal with five minutes of 
business in as little as twenty minutes!<p>

"Wings Stadium" is conveniently next-door to our hotel, a typical medium-sized 
hockey arena, with typical medium-sized hockey arena acoustics. This is 
perfectly suitable for our purposes, as most of our shows will be in such 
places. It is interesting that during this century the old vaudeville type of 
theatres, to the modem "War Memorial-Civic-Convention-Stadium-Centre-Arena". I 
guess it is the democratic preference, but you wouldn't think it would be so 
difficult to build on that sounded good too! But in common with our audiences: 
"We pays our money, and we takes our choice."<p>

Kevin, our personal-ah,-shreve (?),assistant everything, valet, factotum, 
secretary, aide-de-camp, butler, et al), gives the "crew knock" at the door, 
and informs me that my drum riser is in the process of revision by a welder(!), 
and they won't care to discuss some interviews. I cleverly distract him by 
changing the subject.<p>

Through the everlasting fog outside my window, the illuminated "Wings Stadium" 
sign informs me that a local FM station "brings" Rush and Max Webster on 
February 20 at 8:00 p.m.. Now, really! What this really means is that in 
return for the "prestige" of "presenting" a concert, the station has exchanged 
certain promotional favors! (Now don't get all cynical already, the tour's just 
beginning!)<p>

It's 4:30, I can sit around no longer, I'm going to walk over to the hall. The 
mist is still thick to the ground, a line of slowly melting snowbanks smoulder 
eerily, the steam pouring off like smoke. The roar of the nearby interstate is 
muffled and distant. It's a fine, dramatic day.<p>

Inside the building, which we have played at many times, I find my way to the 
familiar dressing room, have my stage-pass photo taken, then walk out into the 
dark cavern of the arena.  The house lights are off so that the stage lights 
can be focused. At stage left I meet up with the guys from the sound crew, who 
I hadn't run into last night, and I perceptively notice that my drums are still 
scattered about the stage like wounded soldiers. I can only be in the way here 
so l went out into the audience area, to check out our new sound and lighting 
set-ups.<p>

We set out to streamline our stage somewhat this tour, and it looks terrific. 
Everything is very uncluttered and symmetrical, and the sound system has been 
re-distributed above and beside the stage. Howard's new lights look great; 
three round multi-lamp fixtures, one above each of us on stage, arid a 
different, cleaner arrangements on the front and rear of the stage. All told, 
something like 400 sweltering sun-lamps for me to sweat under every night!
About this I have mixed feelings, but it will certainly look amazing.<p>

I learn from our stage manager, Michael, that between "flying" (hanging from 
the roof) part of the P.A., the projection screen, as well as the lights, we 
now use a total of 22 rigging points. I guess that's good!<p>

Our co-producers, "Broon", is out with us for a while to work with engineer 
Jon on the refinement of our live sound. They supervise a harrassed looking 
Joe, the chief sound technician. With soldering gun in hand and furrowed brow, 
he probes the bowels of the mixing board, mind awhirl with millivolts, dBs, 
op-amps, and circuits. His counterpart on the lighting crew, the 
cigarette-chewing Nick Kotos, is similarly doing battle in the "Pit of Doom", 
the heart of the lighting system, at stage right. His is a private Inferno; 
banks of dimmers, mountainous coils of serpentine cables, colored gels, and 
clouds of smoke perpetually rising from machines and Marlboros.<p>

The great social event of the touring day is Crew Meal. This is catered at six, 
after sound check and before the doors are opened. so most people are 
"off-duty" for a while. The building is usually quiet, the food is usually 
good, and we are always ravenous, so it makes an enjoyable interlude in the day.<p>

Larry has my drums back together, Liam has Alex's amps and effects working, 
Skip has Geddy's amps and basses ready, Tony has tuned the guitars and 
synthesizers, Greg has the monitors set: everyone has done everything, now 
it's our turn.<p>

We start to work our way through the set, but there are many stops; to adjust 
this, tune that, and fix the other. The night passes slowly, finally finishing 
about 2:00 A.M., and I am exhausted.<p>

It is nice to put on my coat, and just walk out into the quiet night. The fog 
is still a soft shroud over everything, and a bright nebula surrounds the 
streetlights and the "Wings Stadium" sign.<p>

I am struck by the contrast to what often accompanies my walking out of a 
stage door after work. As ever, the smell of diesel smoke hangs in the air, 
but it's so peaceful! I am tired, alone. and left so. It feels nice.<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Wednesday, February 18. Kalamazoo.</font></strong> O Father, I have sinned! It seems
I have overslept the magical hour of 11:30, and can no longer be
served anything resembling breakfast. Sigh.<p>

The lifeless, nasal voice on the phone is "only following orders". and can not 
be tempted to stretch the rules even so far as a grilled cheese sandwich. "Then 
we'd have to do it for everybody", she wittily rejoins, and I am successfully 
put in my place. No surprises.<p>

Despite a momentarily humorous vision of 200 guests simultaneously demanding 
their contraband grilled cheeses, I vent my frustration at "rules" in the 
customary way, by smashing the offending receiver into the guilty phone. In 
independent tests conducted all over the western world, this reporter has found 
the modern telephone to be virtually indestructible.<p>

The television is the usual afternoon wasteland; only the networks here, and 
they each offer simultaneous game shows.  followed by simultaneous soap operas. 
Click! This is freedom of choice? At least most cities have active PBS 
stations, which can sometimes offer interesting diversion on a dull afternoon. 
Sometimes when I'm doing something else, it's nice to leave the picture on with 
no sound, just to make the room seem a little bigger!<p>

I turn to answering a pile of neglected mail, and to putting my notebook in 
order for a new tour's crop of images. One of the good points of an itinerant 
lifestyle, is the magnitude of input, constantly changing and forming 
Parallels, providing new points of view and observations. But of course, it is 
also one of the bad points, sometimes the input is too overwhelming, and some 
peace and quiet would be much nicer! It just goes to prove; even when you have 
everything, it's never the right amount.<p>

Meanwhile, back at the hall, we start of off with the new songs, which begin to 
sound and feel good. After dinner, we run through (walk through?) the whole 
show once again, still pausing often to correct difficulties, adjust  monitors, 
or just for a break!<p>

Things are definitely coming together. Sometimes I feel that brief flash 
of exultation as the music flows out effortlessly, the three of us playing
perfectly; as one. The flash is soon gone, however as a difficult change, 
or a tricky part demands my earnest concentration.<p>

On the way back through the still shrouded parking lot, Alex and Geddy paused 
to enact a scene from an imaginary Ingmar Bergman film. Under the visionary 
direction of G. Lee, Alex plays the stoic, heroic "Bjorn".<p>

LONG SHOT, WIDE ANGLE. It is night. Fog. The streetlights are phantoms, ghostly 
mirages in the thick whiteness of the air. Wisps of steam rise smokily from the 
bizarre shapes of melting snowbanks. Bjorn stands alone. The lightest of Nordic 
breezes ruffles the hair at his noble brow. His chin is raised in defiance of 
unspeakable sorrow he looks heroic, and yet tragic. Leaning into the breeze, 
yet somehow beaten down by it. Bjorn stands. Alone. FADE TO GREY<p>

"Surely a moving, sensitive portrayal of a very human, very' symbolic metaphor, 
evoking a certain abstract-ARRRGGGHH!!!" Thank you, good night.<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Friday, February 20. Kalamazoo.</font></strong> A satisfying pile of answered mail has been 
growing on my desk, much of it in ultra-elegant "Holiday Inn Kalamazoo" 
envelopes. I can never get any mail answered at home, or when we're in the 
studio, but some afternoons on the road are perfect for it. I also kind that 
it's the only way I can comfortably communicate with a fan, and it feels good 
to send off a letter knowing it will bring happiness to the recipient.<p>

I have a long conversation with Ray, our friend and manager, who is in high 
spirits indeed. The album is doing very well, and the tour is selling out all 
over. The novelty and meaning of chart numbers, sales figures, ticket sales, 
and gilded awards has worn away for me, but to a creative businessman like Ray 
they are the measure of his art. What they do all add up to, is a sense of 
people appreciating one's work, which I'm sure no-one ever disdained! Well,
except maybe embezzlers and assassins. Okay, spies and professional -- 
alright, alright! No more sweeping generalities, I promise!<p>

Two of our truck drivers, Mac and Number 9, have just planted 9's rig right in 
front of my window, changing my view from white fog, to White Kenworth and 
trailer. I lean out the window to profane their ancestors, as they disappear 
into Whitey's room next door. Via the window!<p>

Kevin is here for the luggage, as we will be driving straight on to Dubuque 
after the show. I'm feeling a rare twinge of nervousness, and will be glad when 
this first one is behind us.<p>

It's 3:30, and we're not scheduled to go over until 4:00, but I'm just pacing 
aimlessly around, so I think I'll wander over now. Maybe the guys from Max 
Webster have arrived. . .<p>

At 7:00 the doors are opened, and a complete change comes over the building. 
Music plays on the P.S.; the air is charged with the energy and anticipation of 
some five or six thousand people. It's more than a crowd, more than a concert; 
it's a ritual and a celebration.  The electricity in the atmosphere is almost 
tangible.<p>

Max Webster open the show, going on at 8. It's my first hearing of this new 
line-up, and I am impressed; they played superbly and very powerfully. The 
audience response is also strong, and they are brought back for an encore. 
Perhaps they have finally arrived at the right balance of personnel and 
material to capture the ears of America.<p>

It has long been an inscrutable mystery to us why Max haven't caught on down 
here, as we are fans as well as friends, but this is a promising new beginning. 
Chicago will be the real test for them, as for any opening band. They can be a 
very unforgiving audience.<p>

Around 9:00, I slip unnoticed between the cases back of the stage, and up under 
the "tent" which covers my drums before the show. It's nice to get settled in a 
bit early, and avoid the panic of running on when the house lights go down.<p>

The lights are down, the intro tape starts, and there is an incredible roar 
from the audience. Larry and Dave pull the cloth back, as Alex and Geddy come 
running on, plugging in their guitars as they move over to center stage, 
standing in front of me to count in the beginning of "2112". We share a "here 
goes!" look, 2-3-4- and we're away!<p>

The pace of this set is furious; it's a good thing I'm in good shape this 
year! We're about five songs into it, and I'm soaking, before I even have a 
second to grab a quick gulp of "Canada Dry", let alone wiping my dripping face 
and hands with a towel. I can feel that we are playing well, and the audience 
roars it's warm approval. Alex has a colorful new wardrobe in the best of bad 
taste, and is dancing magnificently.<p>

Perception becomes snail-like when I'm playing; peeking out for a moment when 
the going is smooth, then instantly retreating back inside to concentrate in 
difficult areas.  Images are fragmentary and diverse; a face, the roof, a weird 
hat, stage right crew, Geddy's tapping foot, someone singing along, Alex 
dancing, et cetera. These are all punctuated by the oblivious, inner space of 
drums, cymbals, hands, feet, tempo; and is this drumstick going to break in the 
middle of this roll? (They always do.)<p>

Back in the dressing room there's a beautiful array of seafood; oysters, 
crabmeat, and smoked salmon. It looks delicious, but I never develop an 
appetite until an hour or two after the show, when there will only be 
sandwiches and peanuts on the bus. More fool me!<p>

There is nothing so fine as champagne after a show, and tonight we really have 
something to celebrate. The first show is behind us, and it went very well. 
Broon says it sounded great, like we had been out for a week. I feel utterly 
drained, too tired to get excited, but satisfied.<p>

A few minutes spent signing autographs, and I am on the bus.  This is one of my 
favorite parts of a working day. It's like coming home, the day's work done. 
Sit back, relax, maybe put some music on. Sometimes company drops over from 
the crew bus, or one of the drivers will stop by. I don't know how bands that 
fly everywhere can stand it.<p>

When everybody else is aboard, we set off for Dubuque, Iowa, a distance of 
about 300 miles; or six hours.<p>

It takes a long time to wind down after a show. Going to sleep immediately 
would be both difficult and very boring, so there is always some diversion on 
the bus. There are movies on video, video games, music, conversation, and-uh-; 
did I say movies already?<p>

I rode up front with our driver, Whitey, for awhile, talking about sailing, and 
watching the fog-shrouded highway pass under us. By around 3:00 I am tired 
enough to sleep, and make my way back down the bus to my bunk.<p>

We arrive at 8:00, and I find myself standing at the T.V. in my hotel room, 
writing in this notebook, while I wait for the luggage. Strange person.<p>

The view outside is so incredibly typical, that it bears recounting: parking 
lot, small plaza, secondary highway, large plaza, Chevrolet dealership, 
billboards, car wash, motel, and a church spire rising in the distance. The 
number of times in six years on the road that I have looked out the window at 
this view is truly frightening! This could be anywhere from New Jersey to 
California. Only the license plates and the vegetation change.<p>

Never mind this, I'm going back to sleep!<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Saturday, February 21, Dubuque, Iowa.</font></strong> I awake at 1:30, dreading to
pick up the phone, and the daily challenge of breakfast. To my
pleasant surprise, with only a minor skirmish, I am able to have an
omelette. This could turn out to be a nice day!<p>

Last night Alex and I were talking about sailing around the world which has 
become one of my "Great Fantasies". (Perhaps I could write to Ricardo 
Montalban?). What a dream it would be, it is surely one of the few great 
adventures left on earth. Just imagine it; I'll get a big sailboat, plenty of 
provisions, take about two years, and I'll-. Oh, sure. I'll put it on the list 
with Concorde pilot, Formula 1 driver, Wimbleton champion, respected author, 
astronaut, noted architect, fireman -- et cetera. Sigh.<p>

It's 3:45, and I'm all packed and ready to go, but it's unusual not to hear 
from Kevin by now. I feel a sinking sensation, as I suspect the cruel truth. If 
we passed through a time zone last night, it just could be only 2:45. No!<p>

I know that it's true, even as I hope it isn't. What to do?<p>

This is the type of situation where a book can be a savior.  Waiting time is 
not at all the same as free time, and there are limited ways of filling it. 
Especially when the suitcases are all packed!<p>

Reading is perhaps even more flexible than thinking in some cases, such as in 
the middle of a roomful of people, to whom you do not wish to speak. An open 
book has the power of a crucifix against vampires.  (Unfortunately, it seems to 
have no effect on werewolves, who are without shame, and would interrupt 
anything!)<p>

Amid the backstage circus of hangers-on, record and radio "personalities," 
favor-seekers, and people just looking for someone to talk about themselves to; 
I need a barrier and an escape, and books do provide them.<p>

Just spoke to Geddy on the phone. Yes folks there is a time change. Sigh. Pick 
up the book...<p>

Alex has been out flying with the promoter's assistant, so we don't see him 
until sound check. He's trying to build up the hours on his newly-acquired 
pilot's license.<p>

It's another arena; all structural steel and concrete blocks.  Everybody looks 
tired today, it's hard to get back into the timetable of the road; you have to 
move the peak of your day to about midnight. On our bus, I was the only 
virtuous bore to get any sleep, the others were playing video games until our 
arrival at 8:00. Hard core road life.<p>

The longest day of all is that of the lighting crew. Along with the stage 
manager and rigger, they are the first to arrive at 8 or 9 in the morning, and 
don't get away until 2 or 3 in the morning. Hence their boastful T-shirts: 
"First to come, last to pull out!" Like I said, hard core.<p>

Despite the dismal acoustics, Max sound really good from the side of the 
stage. This certainly is the hottest version of the band; excellent new bass 
player, and Steve's slide guitar work is really tasty. "Stixy" is leaning more 
forward in his drumming, more authority and aggression are the cause and/or 
effect Great stuff!<p>

Our own show goes much more smoothly tonight, and I enjoy myself tremendously. 
Unfortunately, Alex suffered string trouble, breaking three in the course of 
the show, and Geddy also has a few spots of trouble, but generally it's a good 
one. The audience is enthusiastic and enjoyable; excepting a few firecracker 
morons.<p>

I particularly can't help noticing two young guys, obviously aspiring 
musicians, who respond with such joy and satisfaction to each change we play, 
that it's inspiriting.  This is in direct contrast to the "phantom guitar" type 
of exhibitionist, as they seldom pay any attention to what we're doing!<p>

After the show, I have an interview with a journalist from Japan. The 
conversation is conducted back and forth through an interpreter, which is a 
novel experience for me. The questions are thoughtful and well-researched, and 
I have a fine time shooting off my mouth. Often after a show, the combination 
of relaxation, and the mental high following extreme concentration, allows the 
thoughts to flow in a lucid and articulate manner. The interview goes well, 
although it takes much longer than usual as everything is said twice!<p>

Back on the bus, we're driving to Davenport tonight, a relatively short drive. 
The video "golf" game is the latest rage, and Howard, Kevin, Geddy and Broon 
are engrossed in that.<p>

Alex and I listen to some music, and drift in and out of conversation. Sitting 
back, tired and relaxed, I recognize that at this moment I am truly content. 
Life is actually good! These moments are rare for any of us, and I savor it.<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Sunday, February 22. Davenport, Iowa.</font></strong> It has rained steadily all afternoon.
Through the leaded glass window of room 228, in "Jumer's Castle Lodge", (an
unlikely Midwestern version of Bavarian Gothic!), is the bleak, colourless
flatness of suburban Bettendorf, one of the Quad (Quint? Qued?) Cities. The
work might be dreary.<p>

I'm fortunate to be reading a hilarious book: "A Confederacy of Dunces", by
John Kennedy Toole. It reminded me of Mervyn Peake or John Barth in its
dark, erudite silliness. The perfect book for such a day. It soon has me
laughing out loud.<p>

As we board the bus to drive to the hall, Whitey tells me that Iowa has the
highest percentage of millionaires in America. Who'd have thought it?
Driving through Davenport, however, we do notice a lot of new, up-market
cars, and a grander than usual display of huge, old Victorian monstrosities
lines the residential streets.<p>

A silver-haired lady drives by in a big brown Buick, sporting brilliantly
colored, knitted Afghan seat covers! Her license plates proclaim her as
"BETTE F". The ones on the car in front of us advise one to "B KOOL". Who
can argue with that?<p>

The hall is bad; in fact it's one of the absolute worst: a college
gymnasium. The usual abysmal acoustics, of course. No seats for the
audience, no room for our projections, bumbling stage and security people
recruited from "Delta House", the most institutional of dressing rooms, and
ask any student about the quality of college food! All this offers welcome
to the weary traveller.<p>

The dressing room! Walled around by the obligatory concrete blocks, painted
in "Penitentiary beige"; one wall filled with shower stalls in "Hospital
green", the other with metal lockers in a particularly offensive gash of
"High school orange". The megawatt fluorescent lights glare greenishly down,
on to sickly faces and purple lips. The hardest of metal chairs, finished in
"Library brown", were manufactured without the least regard for human
anatomy.<p>

As it happens, I'm the only one in here, which speaks well for <strong>my</strong> good
sense! I can't imagine where else anyone could go, but they've found
somewhere. Maybe everybody went home, and left me here as a joke?<p>

Anyway, I'm left alone to read, which is perhaps just as well: this book
has me chuckling to myself frequently. Sure sign of something.<p>

As Max's set finishes, the room is once again full of people and activity.
Gathering towels and drinks for the stage, the crew file in and out in their
final preparations for the show. Change into stage clothes, tape my
shoelaces, give my watch to Kevin, and toss drumsticks around until the
"five minute" call is given by Michael, when Ian takes me by "secret ways"
up to the stage.<p>

It goes fairly well tonight, with only very few interruptions of
electronic and human error. Broon gives an enthusiastic report on the way we
are sounding and playing, and he's a tough nut to please. (or is that
crack?)<p>

He was also interviewed today by the Japanese people, who have asked if I
will speak with them briefly again. Expecting just some final questions, I
consented, only to discover that they want some "Celebrity messages", the
"Hello, I'm Neil Peart from the rock group Rush, and you're listening to the
Rik Rox show, on..." Oh dear.<p>

It is impossible to deliver these "hype lines" with any sincerity or
conviction, and we stopped doing them years ago (perhaps after the first
one).<p>

Somehow, through the translator, with much Oriental consultation among
themselves, they half-heartedly get a couple of general questions on tape. I
sense they are disappointed, and do not understand my feelings, but I cannot
bridge this gap.<p>

As I am putting my coat on to go, the ever-persistant photographer,
undaunted by previous failures to capture me in his lens, asks for just
<strong>one</strong> picture -- "with your coat on!" What!! <p>

It's a five hour drive tonight, to La Crosse, Wisconsin, and a day off.
Yaaayyy!!! A day off on the road is a wonderful thing, the possibilities are
immense! Maybe go swimming, play baseball, hockey, go to a movie, sleep all
day, read a book, watch television, phone home, get falling-down drunk, et
cetera.<p>

I enjoy any of the above, while Alex has perfected the "vampire" day off;
curtains closed, lights off, heat up full, watching T.V. in bed. Geddy will
often be found leading the "Cinema Club" out to a show. We hope to rent some
ice time in La Crosse, and play one of our funny flailing hockey games.<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Monday, February, 23. La Crosse, Wisconsin.</font></strong> We arrive around 4:30, and once
again it's wake up, tumble off the bus and into the hotel, where I'm almost
asleep again, sprawled fully clothed and shod on the bed, when Kevin arrives
with the luggage.<p>

We're staying at the "Radisson", definitely in the better class of hotels,
along with the "Hyatt", "Four Seasons", and "Western International" groups.
It's especially nice to spend a day off in a good hotel. I've asked Kevin to
arrange for a typewriter here, so I can start hammering these notes into
order and legibility.<p>

Apparently the river out there is the Mississippi. That's what it says in
this leaflet, anyway. Maybe it's a different one!<p>

It is nice, though. The banks are groomed into a sort of park, and are
covered with a pretty blanket of snow. It's one of those winter days formed
entirely of metal; the water is lead, the sky magnesium, and the trees on
the far shore are bare skeletons of wrought iron. Nice.<p>

Kevin manages to track down a typewriter later in the day, but
unfortunately the loathsome thing has it for me. This electrical obscenity
is so contrary, and so full of a diabolical hatred for me, that it's
scarcely credible.<p>

Not only that, but this journal business is getting out of hand. I've been
hunched at this distempered machine all day and into the night, flailing out
almost eight boring pages. With shaking hands, and aching fingertips, I made
a brief escape to Alex's room for dinner, but I was soon driven back to
this- this- electrical sodomite!<p>

Other people are out at movies, lying around, having fun, visiting each
other, phoning home, falling-down-drunk, et cetera. It has occurred to me
more than once during the keeping of this journal, that people who keep
journals have less to write about!<p>

I finally give typing a rest (!) about 3:00, and turn with pleasure to "A
Confederacy of Dunces". This book is hilarious. I forced myself to stay
awake until 4:30 to finish it, but it was worth it. Excellent, crazy book!<p>

<font size=+1><strong>Tuesday, February 24. La Crosse.</font></strong> The hall is directly connected to the
hotel, very thoughtfully, so the show is just an elevator ride away. It's a
nice, modern building, with a statospheric ceiling, and; wonder of wonders,
it's warm inside!<p>

The dressing rooms are clean, comfortable, and new; a labyrinth of
inter-connected areas suitable for lounging, tuning, repairing, sleeping,
reading, eating, and- et cetera.<p>

Tonight it's my turn for equipment trouble; bass drum pedal, snare head,
tom-tom head, cymbal stands, and warped sticks all joining in an inanimate
consipiracy against me. This is very frustrating, and the constant
distractions are very upsetting to the concentration.<p>

At such a sensitive time, my usual self-control is of no avail, and one
can only frown fiercely, and curse them every one! Bllaaaaahh!!<p>

Alex is particularly entertaining tonight, and a wordless exchange soon
has me smiling again. Sometimes one can rise above a night, although rarely,
I find.<p>

An interesting telepathy has grown among the three of us over the years.
Between Geddy and myself, it's more of a musical thing; we'll suddenly play
some new little accent together, without ever having spoken of it, while
Alex can have me weak with laughter over a mutually understood private joke.<p>

Broon took our portable video camera out to the mixing board tonight, and
taped the show, which we looked at on the way to Chicago. Since we have
never seen out own show, it's interesting in a "home-movie" kind of way, to
see the projections and lighting effects that go on around us every night.<p>

It's another five hour drive tonight, so I think I'll -- get -- some --
zzzzzzzz.<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Wednesday, February 25. Chicago, Illinois.</font></strong> What?!!? Another day off? There
must be some mistake. I mean, like we just had one!<p>

 Ah-, but tomorrow we begin a marathon of five consecutive nights (groan),
for which this "extra" day off is meant to compensate. Sure.<p>

We'll be playing here for four of those nights, at the International
Amphitheatre, to some 40,000 people in all. Chicago has long been a special
city to us; it was one of the first areas to really support us, and it
remains one of the biggest, both in numbers and enthusiasm.<p>

And the city! I have grown to love some cities on the west coast; like
Seattle, Portland and Vancouver; and in the south Atlanta, New Orleans, and
San Antonio; but with more experience and maturity, it is the fast pace and
raw energy of cities like New York and Chicago that really inspires me.<p>

I think of Chicago as a scaled-down New York. It has all the power and
majesty in its best buildings, all the starkness and squalor in its worst.
It has the culture and the energy in its streets, but seems a little less
intimidating to the outsider.<p>

We're staying at the "Ambassador East", a venerable, dignified old hotel.
I first learned of it while reading John Steinbecks's "Travels With
Charley", as he stayed here during his journey around America, in 1962 I
think it was. Many things have no doubt changed since then, although the
plumbing in my room is not one of them. It protests its age often and
loudly.<p>

I received an afternoon call from Geddy to join the "Cinema Club", as they
were about to attend a matinee of "Tess". As this is one of my favourite
books by Thomas Hardy, I immediately leaped out of bed, into a cab, and
over to the Water Tower Place, to join them. Alas! even the matinee is
already sold out.<p>

We did, however, take the opportunity to walk back to the hotel, through
these fascinating streets. The lights, the people, the buildings, the cars,
the shops; the sounds and smells of the city are intoxicating.<p>

Last year we had the good fortune to visit an apartment on the 95th floor
of the John Hancock building. What a spectacular, breath-taking place, with
a view stretching 50 miles or more. From way up in the sky, we looked down
on a galaxy of city lights, lines and patterns stretching away forever. Wow!<p>

Back in <strong>our</strong> world, some of the guys are going out to a hockey game
tonight; while another eleven of us, myself included, comandeer three cabs,
and go out to a Japanese restaurant. This is one of everybody's favourite
things.<p>

Breathes there a soul so steadfast; to savour the delights of sashimi,
tempura, and teriyaki -- and <strong>not</strong> get drunk on Sake? I only know of one,
there may be more.<p>

We call him "Vings", he is Alex's flight instructor, our occasional
pilot, the friendliest of friends, and truly a "nice Jewish boy". A mother
would be proud, as he drinks only Coca-Cola in the middle of this sushi
madness, keeping pace with the hilarity by his own natural gusto and "joie
de Vivre".<p>

Back at the hotel, after the storm, he and I sit far into the night,
discussing all things great and small. It was here in Chicago last year,
that he made his first visit, and since then he has become very close to us
all. A fine friend, and a great talker.<p>

Good night, already!<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Thursday, February 26. Chicago.</font></strong> The International Amphitheatre: "Home of the
International Livestock Exposition", announces a sign on the end wall.
Although the sign is by no means small, it is easily swallowed in the dim
immensity of the place.<p>

As you might expect by the impressive title, it is a big old barn of a
place, although it has been unsuccessfully camouflaged by countless layers
of paint, in an attempt to disguise its ancient, and basically disreputable
nature.<p>

As in most large cities, we will be using limousines here. This is not so
much for the glamour, but that they hold lots of people, and it is difficult
for our buses to negotiate the narrow streets and heavy traffic. I'm not
sure if it's because of the limos, or because it's a big show, but I often
feel a tension on the way to the hall in one, which I never feel on the bus. <p>

The day is frantic with people wanting things -- pictures, autographs,
decisions, plans, answers, time, opinions, attention--, a break, please!<p>

A rear-projection film arrives today, which we have arranged to accompany
part of "Red Barchetta". It looks great, like a giant computer game. It's
all done with computer animation, and with the road racing away above the
stage, one is drawn right into it! It's especially satisfying for Geddy, as
it was one of his "special-projects", but we're all very excited about it,
and can't wait to see it in the show.<p>

Somehow the show is a bit of a downer for me, for reasons that are
difficult to identify. It doesn't really affect the performance, I played
fairly well, but something; my bio-rhythm, bad karma, vitamin imbalance, et
cetera, made it a difficult, uphill struggle all the way. This kind of night
comes along once in a while, all one can do is fight it out.<p>

Afterwards, I feel drained, and somehow sad. Once again, this is hard to
define: the French probably have a word for it, I guess it's because I've
just done the thing I love to do, and I didn't enjoy it.<p>

I rode back to the hotel with some of the crew, whose high-spirited
bantering cheered me up a little, then I called home, which cheered me up a
lot. I can't imagine living like this, without that warm nucleus of home
always at the back of my mind. The continuity of a growing relationship,
(and a growing family), is immeasurably important to the peace of mind of a
professional "displaced person".<p>

John Gill, a writer from the English "Sounds" paper, drops by my room, and
we begin a conversational interview that lasts into the pre-dawn hours. He
has been a good friend and supporter of ours for some years now, and has
written some of my favourite articles and reviews. He also loves to talk
about things of no consequence just as I do!<p>

Having solved most of the world's difficulties, and successfully
catalogued the vagaries of human nature, we called it quits and parted, just
as the dreadful, pale grey color began to illuminate the room.<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Friday, February 27. Chicago.</font></strong> And it's another busy day. I have phone
interviews with newspapers in Calgary and Indianapolis, both of which go
well. We have found this to be the best way of doing interviews, as one can
choose the day and time in advance, and initiate the phone call yourself,
rather than waiting on someone else.<p>

Newspaper interviews tend to be more satisfying, as even a disinterested
journalist can usually muster a few interesting questions. Radio interviews,
like radio programming, grow more and more restricted, and usually consist
of (between commercials); "Where are you playing next?"; "How did your group
get together?", and "What's your name again?"<p>

Et cetera.<p>

Over at the Amphitheatre, the only reminder of last night is a banner
hanging from the upper balcony, bearing the chorus from Max's "Battlescar":
BUST THE BUSTERS, SCREW THE FEEDERS, MAKE THE HEALERS, FEEL THE WAY I FEEL.
Great.<p>

Geddy has a copy of John Gill's review of the album, which I have been
anxious to see. (It is rare indeed to be anxious to see any review, even
good ones.) As usual, it's a literate, incisive declaration of support. He
catches things that we only <strong>hope</strong> a discerning listener might notice; even
the "haunted child" at the beginning of "Witch Hunt". Thank you, thank you!<p>

The three of us, with towels and drinks, stand huddled together in the
darkness, before the encore. The only light is from the audience; the mystic
ritual of matches and lighters held aloft. We catch our breath, wipe away
the sweat, and prepare ourselves for the final stretch: "La Villa
Strangiato".<p>

"Good one tonight!", remarked Geddy his breathless voice almost lost in
the clamouring crowd.<p>

I nodded agreement silently, as I realized that yes, it <strong>had</strong> been a good
one! I had been so wrapped up in it, in a kind of smooth tunnel of
concentration, that I hadn't yet paused to make that observation!<p>

"Strangiato" goes just as well. Although we have been playing this song
for about three years now, it not only remains very challenging, but
continues to improve every year.<p>

We bid our farewell to the audience, and set off for the dressing room at
our usual rapid pace, oblivious to our surroundings; wet, worn, and wrung
out, but pleased.<p>

Once or twice in the course of every tour, there is a night of blessed
excess; a night of raging joy, and volcanic decadence. It will begin as a
party, but soon erupts into a full-scale celebration of high spirits, and
pressure release.<p>

Tonight is our second annual blow-out at the Italian Village; last year
was so much fun we wanted to repeat it. And we did. Everyone is there:
ourselves, our crew, Max and their crew, some of the wives, all of the
drivers, personal friends, friends from our office and the record company,
and our hosts: the promoter and his people.<p>

So we have about fifty people; eating, drinking, laughing, and talking.
The level rises, and the pace accelerates; the room becomes a living thing.
It vibrates, and boils, and roars and bubbles in a whirling storm of images.<p>

It gathers force; the air is kinetic, charged with an electric joy and a
magnetic camaraderie. There is no world outside this room, only THE PARTY!
The party lives!<p>

The wonderful accordion player, (a tale of his own!), comes bouncing out,
to tumultuous applause, and the room erupts to yet a higher peak of sound
and fury. He dances and capers madly about the whole room, playing and
singing familiar standards, pausing only to wipe the sweat from behind his
steaming glasses.<p>

His face is aglow with happiness, as the crowd enthusiastically
accompanies every song; singing, clapping, dancing, and just plain yelling!
Alex provides a brilliant display of interpretive dance;
"The-Napkin-Drunk-Dance", and the announcement of Dave Berman's birthday
brings a fresh explosion into the room. All around, there is ceaseless
laughter, and the constant roar of shouted conversations. People are at the
tables, on the tables, and under the tables!<p>

It was a <strong>wonderful</strong> party!<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1>
<strong>Saturday, February 28. Chicago.</font></strong> The day begins with a phone call to the
"Detroit Free Press", then I turn to my notebook. I've got to try and find
some words to describe last night. This is no easy thing. Last night! Oy!<p>

Over at the Amphitheatre, we move into Day Three of the Marathon. There
are definitely a lot of drawn faces and tired eyes today (my own included!).
We all share the self-inflicted malady for which there is no pity-, and no
cure! The flesh may be weak, but spirits are still high, and the party is
the main topic of conversation. <p>

Miraculously, the "BUST THE BUSTERS" banner still hangs proudly over stage
left. A radio station has been running a banner contest each night, so there
have been many come and go, but only this one remains. Again!<p>

Three consecutive shows usually finds us at our peak, and tonight is no
exception. By now the show has begun to feel very natural, and precise,
flowing smoothly from song to song.<p>

Ironically, I usually become more self-critical at this point. When
everything is generally very good, the small flaws and errors tend to take
on undue importance.<p>

This then causes the Great and Terrible Sin of overconcentration; that
which causes Geddy to forget words he has sung for years, Alex to forget a
solo he has played 200 times, and myself to commit the simplest and silliest
of errors.<p>

I can feel this starting to happen tonight, as I stumble on a few small
parts that have been giving me trouble. Nothing that a listener could
detect, usually even the other guys in the band wouldn't know; just a small
mental hesitation, or the poor execution of a favourite pattern, just enough
to mar an otherwise good performance, in my mind.<p>

Broon comes in after the show, and is very enthusiastic. In fact, he says
it was "hot!" I've said before that you can't fool Broon, but I don't know
about this. He says there were a few little problems, but that the show felt
great! Hmmm.<p>

Maybe it wasn't so bad?<p>

I'm too tired.<p>

<hr width=50% size=5 align=center><p>
<font size=+1><strong>Sunday, March 1. Chicago.</font></strong> Brrrinngg! Brrrinngg! Brrrinngg! Brrinngg!
Brrrinngg! Brrrinngg! Brrinngg! Brrrinngg! Brrrinngg! Brrri--click---<p>
Me: (croaking whisper) "hello"<br>
Him: (nervous yell) "DIS NEEL PERT?"<br>
Me: (suspicious croak) "who is this?"<br>
Him: (confident bellow) "S'RICK! AH THROO' A MAG'ZEEN ON DA STAGE, 'JA
GEDDIT?"<br>
Now, as it happens, I remember Larry gave me a magazine that had been
thrown on the stage. It was called "The Twilight Zone," and contained
information about Rod Serling, screenplays, and modern fiction in a similar
vein. It was interesting, and since the donor's name was scrawled on the
(torn) cover, I had intended to write and thank the person.<br>
Me: (sigh) "Yes,...yes, I, uh, got it, thank you, it's, uh, it's really
nice. Very interesting..., uh, thanks a lot."<br>
Him: (accusing shout) "HEY, YOU SLEEPIN'!"<br>
Me: (trying) "Well, yes..., I was...but never mind. Thanks a lot...,
really. Uh, good-bye now... Thanks again."<br>
Him: (uncertain shout) "UH, YEAH... RIGHT, BYE."<br>
(Go back to sleep, go back to sleep, don't wake up anymore, you'll feel
terrible, go -- back -- to -- sleep...)<p>

Later in the day, we have a meeting with Ray, in which we discuss so many
crucial things, that we never even get to talk about them all, let alone
decide! It's so hard to talk seriously about events one or two years in the
future!<p>

We map out a general plan taking us into 1983; when to tour, when to
record and (most important) when to have time off. Ray has been trying to
re-negotiate our recording contract, but we remain undecided whether to
endure the dissatisfaction of our present relationship; or risk greater
dissatisfaction in the upheaval of seeking another. (Sound familiar?)<p>

In many ways, today really should be a day off. It was originally
scheduled to be one, but when three shows here sold out so quickly, they
naturally wanted us to do four, and we were faced with an awkward decision.
Do we waive our usual three-consecutive-days maximum, stretching ourselves
to five (including an immovable Milwaukee show), or not play for some of our
potential audience here. Well, we made our decision, knowing that it would
only hurt ourselves, and not the shows. <p>

I feel stiff outside, and empty inside. My fingers feel fat and swollen,
and the muscles in my arms are stretching the skin. Mentally I feel very
introverted, insulated against the world by a barrier of self-protection. I
have often noticed that I am never aware of being in a "bad mood", until I
come into contact with others, and my impatience and sourness has a chance
to reflect off of them.<p>

This is not a day to have to face the world, and especially not a world of
strangers, but one really can't call up and apologize to 10,000 people- "I
can't make it today, uh, something came up, I, uh, swear- it did, I..."<p>

Kevin came over to tell me that a particularly obnoxious group of people
outside have succeeded in angering not only the hotel staff, and Kevin
himself, but even the usually good-natured Alex, with their offensive lack
of manners and demand of "HEY, GIMME YER AUTOGRAPH", "C'MERE TAKE A PITCHER
WID MY GIRLFRIEND", "SIGNS DIS TO RALPH, WILL YA". Sigh. We don't usually
try to avoid our fans, but he suggests that I might prefer to slip under the
street and out through the "Ambassador West". Under the circumstances, and
my state of mind, I accept. I don't think I can deal with that today.<p>

I can only reason that this type of person; like careless drivers and
the people who throw firecrackers and bottles around at concerts; represents
a small minority of the kind that manages to offend everyone in their world.<p>

I have never turned down even a rude request for an autograph, and I make
the time to answer the interesting fan letters that come into my hands, but
I can feel no more remorse for dodging these people, than for throwing away
an illiterate, senseless letter. A guy can only do so much! I'd rather do it
for nice people!<p>

The dressing room here boasts a washer and dryer, which is very convenient
indeed, and they have been rotating constantly for the whole four days. Such
an opportunity is not to be missed and no-one is missing it!<p>

In the main room of the dressing room area, there is a "Space Invaders"
game, and an electronic pinball game, thus the air is continually punctuated
by whirrs, buzzes, booms, clicks, electronic warbles, and high-pitched cries
of "Nuke the Games!".<p>

I sit in one of the ante-rooms, buried in a book or my notebook, keeping
as much as I can to myself. I hate to expose or inflict a black mood like
this.<p>

On stage, a certain amount of "automatic pilot" starts to seep in to my
mental processes. I'm sure this must happen to everybody in any job. Once I
have reached a point of good physical tone, and my brain is focused into the
rhythm and patterns of concentration, I find myself sometimes drifting away
for a few seconds, while my body and part of my mind continues to work.<p>

Like Geddy has said, when you "come back" sometimes you have to wonder:
"What have I been playing? What words did I sing?" It is always right,
though; I guess that, like a plane, things must be well under control before
the "automatic pilot" can be activated. Let us hope so!<p>

As always, we give it everything we have left; and as always, there is
still enough. Like I said, the show won't suffer; we will. Afterwards, the
dressing room is very still and quiet. The crew must load out tonight; after
three nights of being free after the show, everyone is busy.<p>

Eventually, we gather our things, say good-bye for another year to the
people who work there, and drive off through the deserted parking lot, cans
and broken glass glittering in the lights.<p>

There was a rumour the Milwaukee had been picked up and carried away by
outer space aliens -- but I guess it isn't true, so tomorrow it's onto the
bus again, and off to the Arena there. And then <strong>finally</strong> a day off.<p>

And tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. And Milwaukee, and St. Louis,
and Louisville. And Detroit, and Toronto, and Montreal.<p>

Et cetera.<br>
Et cetera.<br>
Amen.<p>
</body>
