<font size=+1>Rush rocks right into the Order of Canada</font><br>
<b>by Norman Provencher</b><p>

Breakfasts at the Geddy Lee household will never be the same after this 
afternoon's Order of Canada ceremonies at Rideau Hall. <p>

"I'll definitely be wearing (the Order of Canada medal) to breakfasts;
probably other occasions, too," said the 43-year-old lead singer and bassist 
for Canadian power trio Rush. <p>

"I'll probably try to get my kids to call me 'Sir', too," Lee joked over the 
phone. "It'll probably be easier to convince my 2 1/2 year-old than my 
16-year-old." <p>

After 25 years on the Canadian rock scene, with about a dozen albums with 
sales of more than a million copies each, the members of Rush join the power 
elite, philanthropists, humanitarians and public servants as "officers of the 
Order of Canada" this afternoon in a ceremony presided over by Governor 
General Romeo LeBlanc. <p>

Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart also earn the right to use 
the letters OC, for officers, after their names. LeBlanc will present the 
awards this afternoon to 43 individuals, including public servant Ronald 
Gould of Ottawa and businessman Frederic Martin of Aylmer. <p>

Rock and popular musicians have been inducted into the exclusive club before. 
But Bryan Adams, Stompin' Tom Connors, Bruce Cockburn, producer David Foster 
and jazz musician Moe Koffman, among others, were all recognized as 
individuals. Rush is the first rock band to be decorated with the Order of 
Canada since the national honor system was created in 1967. <p>

And, while Lee says he and the band are pleased and honored, he's still a bit 
unclear as to why they were selected. <p>

"It can't be about politics, we've never really been a very political band." <p>

Nevertheless, Lee concedes that much of the band's early material, with lyrics 
drawn in large part from the philosophies of libertarian author Ayn Rand, was 
taken too literally for the band's liking. In some circles, Rush was 
identified as a conservative, almost anti-government group, an idea Lee says 
missed the point of a lot of the songs such as the classic Free Will. <p>

"We noticed it particularly in the English press in the late '70s and '80s," 
Lee says. "A couple (of journalists) carried those ideas much too far and it 
became totally absurd." <p>

Lee acknowledges the band found merit in many of Rand's theories but "only as 
they pertained to the idea of artistic freedom. I'd have to say we were never 
very interested in the more extreme libertarianism of her politics." <p>

What the band is interested in these days is their album, Test for Echo, 
which has already sold more than 600,000 copies in Canada and the United 
States. In an unusual development, Test for Echo has been nominated for a 
Juno as album of the year, while the band Victor, a side project for guitarist 
Lifeson, is nominated in the best new artist category. <p>

Rush is on a break from a U.S. tour and is putting together dates for the 
tour's second stage, including a stop in Ottawa some time around Canada Day. <p>

"You know what it's like in Canada at this time of year. The available dates 
are complicated by the hockey playoffs and we're at that hair-pulling stage 
with other bands on tour." <p>
