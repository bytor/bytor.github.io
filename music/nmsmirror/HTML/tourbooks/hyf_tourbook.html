<strong>
The making of "Hold Your Fire"</strong>
<br><br>
<font size=-1>by Neil Peart</font>
</center><br><br><br>

<em>
        It really is hard to believe that <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> is 
our twelfth studio album -- in thirteen years together.  But then it's also 
hard to believe in Relativity and TV evangelists.<p>

        Well.<p>

        We began the songwriting in the autumn of 1986, then started recording
in England in January of 1987.  As we had for <strong>Power Windows</strong>, 
we tried to move around for each stage of the project to keep our environment 
fresh and interesting all the time.  Having worked with co-producer Peter 
Collins and engineer Jimbo Barton on that album as well, we had already 
established a mutual trust and respect that made the work go very smoothly.  
In fact, we haven't enjoyed making a record so much for a long while -- and 
we even finished on time!<p>

        But that's getting ahead of the story ...<p> </em>
 
        <font size=+2>I</font>n early September summer is already over in the mountains, and
everything is quiet and a pleasant kind of lonely.  In a cottage beside
a still lake I began working on some lyrics.  Next month we would be
starting to work on new material and I wanted a little time to prepare
some ideas.  It's hard to walk in with a totally blank slate, the way
I am anyway.<p>

        Having enjoyed writing around the central theme of "Power" last time,
I decided to try something like that again, this time working with the theme
of "Time".  I set to work first on "Time Stand Still".  I'd been thinking
about this for some time now; how so often the richness of a period of time or
an experience seems to lie in looking back at it.  Or conversely, sometimes you
might know that you are enjoying a wonderful time, but just wish you could make
it last longer.  I'm sure you know how that goes.<p>

        But as I set that one aside after a while, and went on to work on other
ideas, it was strange to see that what I had thought was my theme suddenly
turned itself into something else -- without even asking me!  With the
development of ideas for "Second Nature" and "High Water" the theme
suddenly changed to "Instinct", or perhaps "Temperament" -- the idea of
primeval or subconscious drives.  Well okay, I thought, if that's what my
brain wants to work on -- go ahead!<p>

        "Hey Brain -- I don't care what you get fired up about -- as long
as you (you guessed it!) <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>."<p>

        Well.<p>
 
        <font size=+2>O</font>ne bright day later in September, I went over to Geddy's house and we
spent the afternoon catching up on things down in his studio.  Over blueberry
buns and coffee we discussed our aspirations for the next album.  He played
me a few things he'd been working on with his new keyboard setup -- entirely
controlled by a <strong>Macintosh</strong> computer!  It was an amazing 
thing.  After working
out what he wanted to play in the conventional way, he could program it all
into the Mac and assign different parts to any number of separate keyboards.
This proved very valuable to us, both in the songwriting and recording stages
of the album.  Especially so for Geddy, who considers himself a bass player
first, vocalist second, and keyboard player a distant third -- now we had a
keyboard player we could yell at all the time!<p>

        I showed him the work I'd started on so far, and we also discussed
a few lyrical ideas that he had been thinking about but had never got around
to putting on paper.  These ideas would become incorporated into "Mission",
"Open Secrets" and "Turn the Page", and fit very well into my overall theme.
Of course, being the singer, it's nice for him to have some involvement in
the lyric development, and I'm always glad to have some input from him or
Alex to expand on a particular idea.<p>
 
        <font size=+2>I</font>n the beginning of October, with southern Ontario ablaze in the
glory of autumn, the three of us returned once again to the rural setting
of Elora Sound.  Alex brought along a tape of experimental work he had been
doing at home, which would yield some good parts for several songs, and
Geddy had been sifting through this year's batch of "sound check jams",
which have been a rich source of raw material in recent years.  He had them
all sorted and labeled as potential verses, bridges, choruses or instrumental
bits, and thus they served as a reference library of spontaneous ideas that
could be drawn upon at will.<p>

        As usual I was working alone on lyrics in the afternoons while
the other two worked together on musical ideas.  Here is where Alex comes
into his own as Musical Scientist -- creating drum programs for my stand-in,
the drum machine, and recording his and Geddy's work on the portable
"Lerxst Sound" recorder.  In my own process of writing and refining, I remember
one day throwing out eight pages of rewrites for "High Water" -- and that's
after <strong>three days</strong> of rewriting it.  So it doesn't get any easier!<p>

        In the evenings we would go over to the barn, share what we had
accomplished during the day, and work together on making ideas into songs.
This is a very enjoyable part of the process, working so closely together
and creating new things.  Of course nothing is ever accomplished without a
struggle, and sometimes what you're working on seems like it will never turn
out any good.  But when it does come together, and you can record it and hear
it immediately, there are few things more satisfying.<p>

        We were torn about whether or not to play some live shows before
the recording.  In the past we have found it worthwhile in some ways, even
if just to have a change of scene for a few days.  But it's also frustrating
to have to stop working on new material, only to spend a week or so
rehearsing old stuff.  This year we thought we'd try just going away
somewhere for a few days, then returning to the writing fresh.  That way we
would have the advantage of a change of scene, but wouldn't have to spend
precious writing time working on old songs.<p>
 
 
        <font size=+2>T</font>he first snowfall of the year fell overnight in early November, and
by then we had worked out eight songs.  At this point we were still not
satisfied with the overall variety of music we had, so we decided we'd
go a bit further this time.  We were aware of the fact that only a small
percentage of people actually buy records any more, the vast majority
choosing cassettes or CDs.  Thus, we figured, why should we worry about the
time limitations of the old vinyl disc?  We thought we'd like to have
ten songs, and go for fifty minutes or so of music.  So we did.<p>

        At the beginning of December Peter Collins ("Mr Big") joined us
in Elora, and contributed his valuable criticisms and suggestions to
the songs.  Most of the changes were small ones, except for "Mission",
which received new verses, and "Open Secrets", which underwent some
chorus revisions.  But even the small changes help to keep our music growing
in different ways.<p>

        Ironically, the opening song, "Force Ten", was almost an afterthought.
In the tradition of those last-minute, spontaneous songs like "New World
Man", "Vital Signs" and "Natural Science", we put it together on the very
last two days we had for writing.  As I had on "Tom Sawyer", I worked with
some lyrics given to us by Pye Dubois, and Geddy and Alex went to work on the
music, trying to explore some musical areas that we hadn't covered yet.  By
the end of one day it was fairly complete, the touch of spontaneity and
freshness we were looking for to complete the album.<p>
 
        <font size=+2>W</font>e began the serious recording at The Manor, in Oxfordshire England,
where we had also recorded the basic tracks for <strong>Power Windows</strong>.  The big
attraction here is the drum sound in their big stone room.  The big attraction
is not the weather -- especially the January snowstorm that brought England
to its knees, and turned that old stone Manor house into a damn and drafty
icehouse!  Even with the big coal fires that burned in the main rooms of
the house all day, without modern heating or insulation, it did not "hold
its fire"!<p>

        But hey -- we work well when we're shivering!  After three weeks
we were able to leave there with the drums, bass, basic keyboards, guide
guitars and guide vocals all finished.  Once again Jimbo did a great job
for us behind the console, making things sound great and the maintaining
"quality control".<p>

        We had decided before going over there that it would be fun (and funny)
to be cowboys in England, and had provided ourselves with the requisite hats,
scarves, shirts, music -- and most important -- <strong>accents</strong>.  Thus the studio
was full of cowboy-hatted people saying things like: "Ah reckon that sounds
mighty good", and "much obligated for the vittles, ma'am!"<p>

        Thankfully, it didn't influence the music -- but it did give Alex
an exciting new theme for his oil paintings.<p>

        Well.<p>
 
 
        <font size=+2>F</font>rom there we moved into Ridge Farm Studio, an Elizabethan farm which
has been converted into a modern residential studio.  It was our first time
working there, in the rustic Surrey countryside, and we enjoyed it very much.
(Even though it was still winter in England.)<p>

        <strong>It has to be said</strong> -- as the man himself might say, Andy Richards did
a great job once again, adding dynamic keyboards and exciting "events" to
the tracks.  For once we were moving along right on schedule, and Alex was
even able to finish some guitar overdubs before we left.<p>

        On a free day Geddy and I made an overnight trip up to London, treating
ourselves to a stay at the prestigious <strong>Savoy</strong> hotel.  We each had our own plans
for the afternoon and evening, but met up in the venerable "American Bar" at
the hotel for a drink in the late afternoon.  We were both so stimulated
by being out on the streets of London (and away from work), that our
conversation was rich and various -- about ourselves, our families, art, movies,
our hopes for the future -- and not a word about the work in progress!  It was
really nice how two people who work together every day, and had for so many
years, could find fresh areas of stimulating conversation.<p>
 
 
        <font size=+2>T</font>hen it was back to -- aaah! -- <strong>Montserrat</strong>, a small island in the
Caribbean which is notable -- apart from its beauty -- for turning out doctors
in a couple of weeks, and for turning out records in paradise at Air Studios.
We had been there for the first time to do the guitar overdubs for <strong>Power
Windows</strong>, and enjoyed it so much we had to go back again.<p>

        There is a live volcanic crater on the island, where you stand in
a cloud of sulfurous mist and all around you are vents of steaming vapors
and bubbling volcanic mud.  When you think about the fact that this
comes up right from the centre of the earth, it reminds you powerfully just
how fragile <strong>terra firma</strong> really is, and how quickly a place like that could
disappear beneath the beautiful Caribbean Sea.<p>

        One hopes <strong>It</strong> will hold its you-know-what too!<p>
 
 
        <font size=+2>W</font>e had not worked in Toronto for, oh, about ten years, fearing too
many distractions (however enjoyable and well-meant) from family and friends.
But it does get harder to be away from home all the time, and for once we
thought we'd like to try doing at least a small part of this project at
home.  So we decided we would record the vocals and the last of the guitars
in Toronto.<p>

        We worked at McClear Place Studios, right in downtown Toronto, which
was nice after all the remote places we'd been.  I must admit, as much as I
like the country and particularly Montserrat, it was exciting to walk the
busy streets and see all those <strong>strangers</strong> every day.<p>

        It was here that Aimee Mann came in to do a great job on some
additional vocals for us -- yet another new sound for <strong>Rush</strong> -- and also, all
of us signed up with the Berlitz school to polish up our French for the
next stop on our itinerary -- <strong>Paris</strong>!<p>
 
 
        <font size=+2>W</font>e arrived there on a bright sunny day in early May, with the chestnut
trees still in bloom along the boulevards, and had our first breakfast at
a sidewalk cafe on the Boulevard St. Germain.  We were staying right on the
Champs Elysees, and working at a good place called Studio Guillaume Tell,
about five miles away.  Our route to and from work every day led right
through the Bois de Boulogne, the biggest park in Paris, so it was a great
situation.<p>

        Normally we work twelve or thirteen hour days while we're recording,
but "Mr Big" likes to stop by nine o'clock during the mixing, it's difficult
to remain objective after nine hours of listening to the same song over
and over again, and you can't afford to be wrong when you're making final
decisions like that.  But that's okay -- we didn't mind having to go out for
late dinners at night with the day's work done, and the streets of Paris
lit up before us!<p>
 
 
        But of course there is a dark side to the City of Light.  Especially
after the events of last summer, it was impossible not to think of acts of
mindless violence, the kind of thing "Lock and Key" talks about.  We even
had one or two bombs go off while we were there, though fortunately not
on <strong>us</strong>!  And you don't get used to seeing the soldiers and 
gendarmes standing around everywhere with automatic weapons and bulletproof 
vests.<p>

        There is no fooling around with situations like that, and I would
ride carefully by them on my bicycle, almost as afraid of them as I was of
the Parisian traffic -- and that's going some!  Cruising by these 
deadly-serious guys with their deadly-serious weapons.  I had to hope their 
fingers wouldn't slip, or they wouldn't mistake me for some vicious bicycle 
terrorist!<p>
 
        <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> indeed.<p>
 
        <font size=+2>O</font>kay, okay -- no more puns, I promise.<p>

        In fact, I'd better start again:<p>
 
<em>
        It really is hard to believe that <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> is our twelfth
studio album -- in thirteen years together.<p>

        But then it's also hard to believe in the expanding universe,
superconductors, indoor baseball, 3-D movies, artificial sweetener, offensive
weapons, objective reality, rock music ...<p>
 
        What?<p>
 
        Well.<p> </em>

He looked at me coldly and aksed: "Do you want the equipment or not my
friend?"<p>

I said: "Just the list if you don't mind."<p>

"You are a fool then! Get out and never come back to this place again... my
late friend!"<p>

I figured it was time to leave but I didn't know where I was. Last I remember,
we were on one of those group tours in Gallien-Kruger National Park. But I...
can't... seem.... to... remember... exactly what... Wait! I do remember now! I
received a calbe from a Mr Johnson instructing me to put my Signature on some
kind of document at an office in Zurich. I flew there on a Ja Maha Air out of
Vacici el Barundi and was met at the airport by a Herr Roland from the offices
of Cuzle, Cuzle and Shmelecki. Before we got to the office he suggested we
have a drink: "Come, we will make drinken" and we stopped at some dark
roadside 24 hr. bar and hobby shop called the "Dimension D". We went inside
and there at the back by the S.E.C. 12 channel transmitters and the balsa
ailerons was the notorious Schatz. I was in big trouble. He has a Mac under
one arm and a Backgammon game under the other. Who knows what he had in his
pockets. Time to splittez-vous. I looked over at my escort, the walking
building and asked "Hey Mongo you hungry?"<p>

He looked at me and said: "Ja, I am making hongry unt mine interior."<p>

Well I suggested a knuckle sandwich and then headed for the door just as the
drink I ordered, a Tahiti Tingle, took its effect. I'd been drugged and fell
to my knees and now looked eye to eye with Schatz. I said: "so yoi gralf
kanoff illglit!"<p>

He just looked at me and laughed: "Yeah that's right!"<p>

When I awoke I was tied to a table and Schatz was explaining about a new
program he'd just developed. He was the only one listening. He was listening
to himself so intently he didn't notice the sword I had taped to the bottom of
my shoe. Out the window, down 16 stories, hi-jack a cab to the airport, steal
a Lear Jet, land on the Queen Mary, swim half the North-Atlantic, stop for
lunch at Big Al Hernsburgers and then...<p>

"Wait my friend, I didn't really mean all that. I lost myself for a moment.
Now please, do you want the equipment or not?"<p>

"No," I said, "It's just not quite as exciting as I hoped."<p>

"Too bad," said the Sarge.<p>
 
"Yep, probably an accident! Yeah, that's right -- probably an accident!"
replied Detective Brophy.<p>

"This was no accident. I've seen this sort of thing too many times before, and
always the same result."<p>

"How did he do it? How did he do it? Was it --"<p>

"You don't want to know. All I can tell you is, it wasn't pretty."<p>

"Did he leave a message? Some kind of note?"<p>

"Yeah, kind of sad. All it said was:<p>

<em>'One synth is too much, and a thousand aren't enough'"</em><p>

"How depressing! But exactly what did he have?"<p>

"Well, he had about a zillion Akai S900 samplers, two Prophet VS synths, a PPG
2.3, a Roland Super Jupiter and a D-550, two Yamaha KX-76 MIDI controllers,
two QX-I sequencers and a DX-7, two MIDI Mappers, Korg MIDI pedals -- and
believe it or not -- Moog Taurus Pedals."<p>

"That's sick!!"<p>

"You're telling me! And get this: he had to have some joker named Jack Secret
load floppy disks and switch programs for this stuff offstage during the
shows!"<p>

"Oh! Well, it all makes sense now, doesn't it?"<p>

"Sure does. At least his bass gear was simple. He used a Wal bass, a 5-string
Wal bass and a Steinberger."<p>

"What a relief! But tell me Sarge, what makes a guy go wrong like this?
Digital Stress? Too much herring? What?"<p>

"I don't know Brophy. I think it's just one of those things best left
unsolved!"<p>

Well, lots of Big News in the equipment department this year, for those of you
who are interested in such things. When I decided last year that I wanted to
get a new set of drums, I went about it in a very methodical way. This time I
wanted to be <strong>absolutely</strong> sure that I was using the best
sounding drums there were. So I went down to the Percussion Centre in Fort
Wayne, and we tried out six different makes of drums, side by side with the
same heads and tuning. The result was a new set of Ludwig drums -- the ones
which sounded the most lively and exciting. A similar "A-B" comparison
confirmed the effectiveness of the Vibrafibing treatment, and that process of
a thin layer of fibreglass has been applied to the inside of the shells.<p>

When Geddy saw the color I had chosen for them, he asked: "Whatever
<strong>possessed</strong> you?" Well I'm not sure about that, but it's
another "hot rod" finish like the red ones, this time a combination of white
opalescent, with a few "flip-flop" sparkles, and a little
<strong>hint</strong> of pink.<p>

Just different, that's all.<p>

The hardware, which has been prass-plated, is a combination of Premier, Tama
and Pearl fittings, while the cymbals are by Avedis Zildjian, with the
exception of the Chinese ones which come from Wuhan province in China. The
venerable Slingerland "Artist" snare drums remain, as do the Promark 747 drum
sticks.<p>

Big News in the electronics department as well -- the Simmons pads now trigger
an Akai digital sampler through a Yamaha Midi Controller. This has expanded my
range of available percussion sounds enormously, allowing me to have
absolutely <strong>any</strong> sound available at the flick of a stick or the
kick of a switch. Nice. I've also added a KAT keyboard percussion unit, which
again gives me all of the keyboard percussion sounds in a neat little
package.<p>

In the "traditional" percussion domain, there are a temple blocks, timbale,
crotales, a Tama gong bass drum, cowbells and wind chimes.<p>

What else was I going to say?<p>

I forget.<p>

Oh well.<p>
