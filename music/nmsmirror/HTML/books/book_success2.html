    As the original founding member of Rush, Alex Lifeson is by far the
best authority to consult on the group's formative years. The guitarist
still has vivid memories of those early days and recalls: "Rush initially
started gigging in September, 1968, and the first shows we ever did were in
the basement of a church in Toronto. It was a dropin center and you'd get
between 30 and 40 people on a Friday night, who'd be served tea, coffee and
potato chips, while the band played.<p>

    "At that stage, the line-up consisted of myself, John Rutsey on drums
and a bassist called Jeff Jones, who'd played in a number of Toronto groups
and a couple of fairly successful Canadian bands. But he left after the
second gig because he had too many other commitments. We were all very
young, though, so it was no big deal and only about 60 people had actually
seen us.<p>

    "I'd known Geddy for a couple of years and, at that point, I'd jammed
with him quite a lot. So, after Jeff had gone, I called him up and I think
he expected me to ask if I could borrow his amplifier, which I was always
doing! But I asked him if he could come and do a gig with us and he agreed.
We went down early and ran through about a dozen songs that all three of us
knew. We ended up playing those three times over during the course of the
evening!<p>

    "Things worked out, though, and after a couple of shows we were offered
a steady gig there until March, 1969, by which time we were playing to
about 300 people a night. It was steady work and we were getting paid 25 to
30 dollars per gig, which wasn't bad. We'd split that three ways and either
spend it in a restaurant or just do whatever we wanted with our ten bucks.
Everybody was in their mid-teens and, during the day, we were still going
to school.<p>

    "In March, we expanded the group and a piano player joined, who ended
up becoming Geddy's brother-in-law. He was in the bad for five or six
months, but it didn't really work out and in the end he left, followed
shortly by Geddy. Basically, things were falling apart and so we broke up.
But after a few months we decided to get back together as a trio and things
went from there.<p>

    "I think the turning point for us was when the drinking age in Ontario
was lowered to 18; it had previously been 21. All of a sudden, there were
stacks of clubs to play that were never there before. We started working
professionally at that point, which was in 1972. Rather than just playing
one or two high schools at the weekend, and maybe three or four gigs in the
course of a month, we were playing six days a week, with matinees on
Saturdays -- week after week after week! We never stopped. You'd do a
rotation: play one club one week and then a series of others, before ending
up at the first one six weeks later. There was never really a shortage of
work and pretty soon we made enough cash to go into the studios."<p>

    Towards the end of 1973, Rush played their biggest gig so far, opening
up for the New York Dolls at a Toronto concert hall. Having garnered a
strong following on the local club circuit, the group had little difficulty
in blowing the headliners off stage. Yet, despite their ever-increasing
popularity and the fact that they had earned enough money to make an album,
Rush faced one major problem -- a total lack of record company interest.<p>

    "It was extremely hard for us to get a deal," reflects Alex. "Nobody
wanted to sign us because we just weren't considered 'sellable' at the
time. In Canada, if you were the Guess Who, then you had a much better
chance because you had something that was very commercial, which could be
heard on the radio. We always had a strange reputation in the Canadian
music industry. Nobody wanted to know us because we were labeled as being
too heavy, with a singer who had a crazy voice."<p>

    Consequently, Rush were forced to enter the studios without the support
of a record label. The band was aided by longtime manager Ray Danniels and
his partner Vic Wilson. Danniels had initially become involved with the
trio after promoting a South Ontario high school concert several years
earlier. However, allocating recording time was extremely difficult, since
the group had to keep gigging in order to sustain their cash-flow.<p>

    "We had to start work after playing in a club and record through the
night," Alex explains. "We'd tear down the gear and go in at two in the
morning until eight, when we had to get out. You'd do that one week, but
then you couldn't get back in the studios for another three weeks, which
was very frustrating. But we had no other options. Without a proper record
company behind us, we had to make do the best we could.<p>

    "That's how the first Lp was done. I think we only spent three days of
actual recording, and then a couple more re-doing two songs and mixing the
whole thing. It was all done in under a week, but was spread out over
several months."<p>

    The debut <strong>Rush</strong> album finally emerged on the group's self-financed
Moon Records label in early '74. While later works were to see them
establishing their own identity, on the first Lp they seemed content to
mimic the styles of others, particularly Led Zeppelin. Alex Lifeson's
guitar work owed a good deal to Jimmy Page and Geddy Lee was once described
as sounding like "Robert Plant on acid!" Mind you one could hardly compare
John Rutsey's pedestrian drumming with the mighty John Bonham.<p>

    "Finding My Way" opened the album in a raunchy, aggressive manner and
its hard-rocking pace was maintained on the ensuing cuts "Need Some Love"
and "Take A Friend". The first side was brought to a close by the more
subtle "Here Again", on which the strains of an acoustic guitar provided a
little variety to proceedings.<p>

    Side two kicked off with "What You're Doing", a number very reminiscent
of Zeppelin's classic "Heartbreaker". Next up was "In The Mood", the lone
survivor in the current live show. This tune, always popular with the fans,
was penned by Geddy, but the rest of the tracks on <strong>Rush</strong> are credited as
joint Lee/Lifeson compositions. "In The Mood" was followed by "Before And
After" and finally the album ended with "Working Man", the Lp's winner,
which featured a marathon lead break from Alex. On the whole, <strong>Rush</strong> was a
very basic heavy metal record, one that was hardly indicative of what was
to come in the future.<p>

    Although there was now vinyl product to promote, Rush's troubles were
far from over. "Our reputation still wasn't good," scoffs Alex. "But we
eventually got a break when a powerful FM radio station in Cleveland got
hold of the record and started playing it a lot."<p>

    The station in question was Cleveland's WMMS and the DJ who picked up
on the group was a lady named Donna Halper. Her consistent turntable spins
resulted in strong import sales, which subsequently caught the attention of
the noted ATI booking agency in New York, who then expressed an interest in
lining up some Stateside dates for the band. A tour was finally arranged
when Rush signed a worldwide deal with Mercury Records.<p>

    July, 1974, saw the release of the <strong>Rush</strong> album in the US and, at long
last, the trio was set to cross the border. However, not before drummer
John Rutsey quit the line-up.<p>

    Asked to explain the reason for Rutsey's departure, Alex assesses: "It
was weird. I'd actually been friends with John for a long, long time --
since we were about eight or nine years old. John was not the easiest
person to get along with; he was quite moody at times and I think he
expected a lot from his friends. When we got to the point that the decision
had to be made, we'd already thought about getting a new drummer for the
past year. John was aware of it -- he was very sick at the time -- but
after we tried another drummer, we said to him 'It's not working out. Do
you think you can get it together?'<p>

    "We managed to work for another year, but in the end there was no point
because we weren't really getting along very well. Musically, Geddy and I
wanted to do a lot of different things and he wasn't really into the idea.
He wanted to go into more of a straight ahead rock thing, like Bad Company,
I guess. When we sat down and talked about it, he decided he was going to
leave.<p>

    "We played another six weeks of gigs and, strangely enough, we had the
best time we'd ever had playing together. I kept in touch with him for a
few years afterwards, but I haven't seen him in three or four years. I hear
he's into body-building now and that he did a bit of TV work but, other
than that, I don't really know."<p>

    John Rutsey's exodus from the line-up actually turned out to be
something of a blessing in disguise, since it precipitated the arrival of
the multi-talented Neil Peart. During Rush's early days, Neil had played in
several bands around the Niagara Peninsula area, before going off to live
in England for a year and a half. Eventually, somewhat disillusioned by the
British music scene, he returned to Canada, where he hooked up with Rush.<p>

    Neil joined the band on June 29, 1974 -- Geddy's 21st birthday -- and
settled in very quickly. According to the bassist: "When Neil joined, we
were playing material from the first Lp and from our club days. So,
basically, he fitted in to what was already there and it soon became as
close to him as it was to us. To tell the truth, after about six weeks, it
never seemed to me that we'd had anyone else in the band."<p>

    Rush's debut appearance on American soil was on August 14, in front of
11,462 people at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. Uriah Heep topped the bill,
which also featured Manfred Mann's Earth Band, and the concert marked the
start of what was to be a protracted period of road life for the Canadian
trio. During the fall, Rush played dates with Blue Oyster Cult and Rory
Gallagher, and, by the end of the year, they had sold 75,000 copies of the
first album. What's more, the group had gained invaluable touring
experience from that inaugural Stateside outing.<p>

    In January, 1975, Rush entered Toronto's Sound studios to start work on
the second Lp. It must have been quite a relief for Alex and Geddy not to
have to record spasmodically, as they had done last time. When <strong>Fly By
Night</strong> came out the following month, it was clear that they had benefitted
from having the time to achieve the sounds they wanted. Many regard this as
the first proper Rush album and the music had certainly progressed way
beyond the limitations of basic hard rock.<p>

    <strong>Fly By Night</strong> evidenced the injection of a strong fantasy element,
courtesy of Neil Peart's imaginative lyrics, and "By-Tor And The Snow Dog"
was the first of many <strong>epic</strong> works. The characters in the sketch had been
inspired by road manager Howard "Herns" Ungerleider and the drummer's story
dealt with the battle between Prince By-Tor (Geddy Lee -- "Knight of
darkness, centurion of evil, devil's prince") and the <strong>good</strong> Snow Dog (Alex
Lifeson). Snow Dog eventually emerged victorious and the whole number was
to become an integral part of the Rush live show. <p>

    The group had clearly realized that variety was the spice of life and
consequently the Lp contained a diverse selection of material -- another
Zeppelin influence? While the opening cut "Anthem" (the title stemmed from
the book by Russian authoress Ayn Rand) proved that the trio still
possessed the ability to rock hard, the delicate "Rivendell" (a village in
J.R. Tolkein's <strong>Lord Of The Rings</strong>) acted in total contrast. Other good
songs included "Beneath, Between and Behind", "In The End" and the title
track itself. Quite simply, <strong>Fly By Night</strong> proved that Rush had far more to
offer than your average run-of-the-mill heavy metal band. <p>

    The overall response to the record was most encouraging. It went gold
in Canada, sold respectably in the United States and also earned the trio a
Canadian Juno Award as "Best New Band." Coinciding with the Lp's release,
Rush embarked on a four-month American tour, opening for the likes of Kiss
and Aerosmith. Subsequently they headlined their first major Canadian dates
and attracted a 4,000-strong sell-out crowd at Toronto's Massey Hall.<p>

    The summer of '75 saw the release of Rush's third album, <strong>Caress Of
Steel</strong>. Unfortunately, though, it turned out to be a miserable flop. Why?
Well, there are several theories. Firstly, the group had recorded the Lp
only a few months after completing <strong>Fly By Night</strong> and the fact that they
returned tot he studios so quickly may well have had adverse effect.
Secondly, they continued to indulge in mammoth storylines, this time
devoting an entire side to "The Fountain Of Lamneth". It was widely felt
that they had stepped out of their depth and become self-indulgent.<p>

    Whatever the reasons for its commercial failure, many fans have since
found <strong>Caress Of Steel</strong> to be a highly entertaining package. The first side
featured three relatively short numbers -- "Bastille Day", "I Think I'm
Going Bald" and "Lakeside Park" -- together with the 12 1/2 minute tale of
"The Necromancer", in which Prince By-Tor was to make a brief cameo
appearance. "The Fountain Of Lamneth" was a classic opus and was divided
into six different parts: "In The Valley", "Didacts And Narpets", "No One
At The Bridge", "Panacea", "Baccus Plateau" and finally "The Fountain"
itself. There were some marvelous mood changes and the overall
instrumentation was quite superb.<p>

    Be that as it may, <strong>Caress Of Steel</strong> was hardly destined to do Rush any
favors and their ensuing US dates soon became tagged as the "Down the tubes
tour." Things certainly weren't looking good for the band and, as they
played a series of small town clubs, their momentum appeared to have been
lost.<p>

    Not to be deterred, Rush returned to Toronto's Sound studios at the end
of the year, where they spent the cold winter months recording a new album.
In the spring of 1976, they re-emerged with <strong>2112</strong>, which heralded the 
turning point in their career. The group was extremely positive about the 
record and as Neil Peart later remarked: "We felt at the time that we had 
achieved something that was really our own sound, and hopefully established 
ourselves as a definite entity."<p>

    Although critics had previously slammed Rush for indulging in marathon
pieces, the band adhered to its principles on <strong>2112</strong>. The whole of side one
was consumed by the ambitious title track! Once again, Neil had been guided
by the late Ayn Rand's literary skills and the "2112" story was centered
around the struggle of freedom against oppression in a futuristic society.
Under the stern dictatorship of the "Priests Of The Temples Of Syrinx", the
main character finds a guitar and makes music, something unheard of in his
culture-less world. He takes his discovery to the priests, but it is
immediately rejected and destroyed. Rush fanatics reveled in the tale and
it was to become a major highlight of the group's concert performances.<p>

    The second side of the record comprised a further five winning cuts: "A
Passage To Bangkok", "The Twilight Zone", "Lessons", "Tears" and "Something
For Nothing". All in all, it was a very good album.<p>

    By June '76, Rush had sold 160,000 copies of <strong>2112</strong> in the United
States alone and had also received gold awards for the <strong>Rush</strong> and <strong>Caress
Of Steel</strong> albums back home in Canada. The group's obvious penchant for
science fiction/fantasy works brought them to the attention of Marvel
Comics' writer David Kraft. In fact, the March '76 issue of <strong>The Defenders</strong>
was dedicated to the trio and the comic's villain, Red Rajah, actually
quoted from the song "The Twilight Zone".<p>

    More importantly, though, <strong>2112</strong> helped Rush to build heavily on a
strong underground following that was growing rapidly in Britain. Despite
the fact that the album wasn't actually released there until 1977, import
copies began to filter through and created considerable interest among UK
rock fans.<p>

    In the fall of 1976, Rush issued the live <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong> Lp,
which had been recorded over three nights -- June 11, 12 and 13 -- at
Toronto's Massey Hall. The double record set opened with "Bastille Day" and
the rest of the first side contained "Anthem", "Fly By Night", and "In The
Mood". Part two continued with "Lakeside Park" and an edited version of
"2112". Side three took us back to <strong>Fly By Night</strong> days and featured "By-Tor
And The Snow Dog" and "In The End". Both renditions were infinitely better
than their studio counterparts and during "By-Tor" there was a lively
guitar/bass battle between Alex and Geddy. The final section of "Working
Man", "Finding My Way" and "What You're Doing" brought the package to an
exciting climax.<p>

    Due to the lack of overdubs, <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong> had a few rough
edges, but nevertheless served as an excellent live representation of
Rush's music from 1974 to 1976. Indeed, as the group's sleeve notes on the
back cover read: "This albums to us, signifies the end of the beginning, a
milestone to mark the close of chapter one in the annals of Rush."<p>

    Following the emergence of the live album, the band set off on another
session of Canadian and American dates, which saw them moving into
considerably larger venues. Rush finally celebrated the end of a hugely
successful year with a show at Toronto's massive Concert Bowl. Such was the
demand for tickets that they were forced to add an additional performance
at the venue a few days later. At these two gigs, the trio played to in
excess of 15,000 fans. <p>

    It had taken eight years, but there could be no doubt that Rush had
finally arrived.<p>

<strong>
<font size=+1>
-- In The Limelight --
</font></strong><p>

    Eager to capitalize on the triumphs of <strong>2112</strong> and <strong>All The World's A
Stage</strong>, Rush launched into 1977 with another fullscale American tour. Yet,
although they were now able to pack out midsize venues across the nation,
the band still found it impossible to gain radio airplay. Consequently,
staff at Mercury Records put together a promotional album, featuring a
selection of material from <strong>2112</strong>, <strong>Fly By Night</strong> and <strong>Caress Of Steel</strong>,
which they sent out to radio stations. It was amusingly titled <strong>Everything
Your Listeners Ever Wanted to Hear by Rush...But You Were Afraid to Play</strong>.<p>

    Meanwhile, due to mounting interest on the other side of the Atlantic,
it was soon announced that Rush would be embarking on a series of European
dates in June. The British leg would take in seven cities and, as soon as
tickets were made available, box offices reported lighting sales.<p>

    On June 4, 1977, Rush made their debut appearance at London's hallowed
Hammersmith Odeon and the sell-out crowd witnessed a truly memorable
performance. The set basically followed the running order of <strong>All The
World's A Stage</strong>, with the addition of "The Necromancer" and a new number
entitled "Xanadu". The audience consisted of diehard Rush addicts and few
left the hall disappointed at the end of the show. Sitting in the
auditorium, it was amazing to see at first had the phenomenal cult
following that Rush had created in the UK and even the band was surprised.<p>

    "We thought we might have a bit of a following in Britain, having
received some fan mail," states Alex. "But basically we just expected small
to average crowds. When we realized how strong the fan level was, we were
totally blown away."<p>

    Upon completion of the British trek, Rush played selected dates in
Sweden, Germany and Holland. Soon, however, the group was back in Britain
to start working on a new album at Rockfield studios in Monmouth, Wales. It
marked the first time that they had recorded outside their native Canada
and the different environment brought about a definite change in their
musical approach.<p>

    <strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong> hit the streets in September '77 and saw the
band's material becoming more complex. Geddy had started playing
synthesizers and one could sense that the trio was keen to expand its
overall sound. Side one commenced with the title track, a fairly concise
number, and was followed by the more adventurous "Xanadu", which clocked in
at well over 11 minutes on record. The second half of <strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong>
boasted three shorted tunes in "Closer To The Heart", "Cinderella Man" and
"Madrigal", but was dominated by the epic "Cygnus X-1". At the end of the
track, the hero of the story was left plunging into a black hole on his
space ship Rocinante; the group promised to conclude the tale at a future
date.<p>

    After recording in the peaceful Welsh countryside, Rush had mixed the
Lp at London's Advision studios and upon its release they returned to North
American concert halls. By November, <strong>2112</strong>, <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong> and
<strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong> had all been certified gold in the United States.<p>

    Breaking their hectic US touring schedule, Rush played 14 British dates
in February '78, after which they set off on a brief European jaunt. It was
during this period that Mercury decided to re-issue the first three studio
albums as a triple set titled <strong>Archives</strong>. In June, the band garnered the
second Juno Award, this time as "Best Group Of The Year"; they had now
accrued six gold and three platinum discs in Canada.<p>

    When the <strong>Farewell To Kings</strong> tour finally came to an end, Rush
immediately returned to Rockfield studios, where they spent most of the
summer recording their next Lp. <strong>Hemispheres</strong> was by far the trio's most
daring effort to date and took a lot longer to complete than had originally
been anticipated. "It was the longest time we'd ever spent on an album,"
proclaims Alex. "By the time we got to Trident studios in London for the
mixing, we'd been in Britain for two and a half months, one month longer
than we'd expected. But the thing is that <strong>Hemispheres</strong> was a different
album altogether and it headed off in various directions."<p>

    True to their word, Rush completed the "Cygnus X-1" story in the form
of the marathon title track, which spanned the whole of the first side. In
fact, there were only three other numbers on the rest of the Lp -- "The
Trees", "Circumstances" and "La Villa Strangiato". The latter, a lengthy
instrumental, basically served as a showcase for Alex Lifeson's finger-
picking skills and was apparently inspired by one of his nightmares!<p>

    Neil Peart came up with the lyrics for the "Hemispheres" piece after
reading the book <strong>Powers Of Mind</strong>. He wrote about the division of the brain
into hemispheres, with the characters Dionysis and Apollo controlling the
left and right sides, respectively. Cygnus arrived on the scene as the
bringer of balance.<p>

    To be blunt, the whole concept got a little out of hand and it seemed
that the direction of the music had become of secondary importance. When
reviewing the Lp for the British weekly music journal <strong>Melody Maker</strong>, I can
recall pointing out that Rush might find themselves getting into a rut if
they continued producing extended works, that were definitely becoming
self-indulgent. They had more than proved their capabilities as techno-rock
masters, but now it was time to come back to earth again. Judging by the
nature of their ensuing outputs, Rush obviously felt the same way.<p>

    Following the album's October release, Rush began a 113-date "Tour of
the Hemispheres", which kept them on the road for the next eight months. By
December, 1978, <strong>Hemispheres</strong> had shipped gold in the US and, in the same
month, the group enjoyed three sell-out shows at Toronto's Maple Leaf
Gardens, smashing all previous box office records at the venue.<p>

    As usual, concerts had commenced in North America and it wasn't until
April '79 that Rush traveled to Britian. The UK gigs opened with a two
night stand at Newcastle City Hall and continued through to mid-May, with
old Canadian friends Max Webster supporting. The next step was to Europe
and finally the tour came to a close on June 4, with an appearance at the
Pink Top festival in Holland. Alex Lifeson was forced to struggle through
that particular show with a broken finger.<p>

    Having spent the past two summers at Rockfield studios, the band
members were glad to get back home to Canada for their 1979 vacation. Up
until now, they had maintained a non-stop schedule of touring and recording
and, at last, they were able to take a well-earned rest before entering the
studios. Rush enjoyed a six-week holiday and then re-assembled at Lakewoods
Farm to start work on <strong>Permanent Waves</strong>. They wrote and rehearsed in an old
farmhouse and, after a few days, rough versions of "The Spirit Of Radio",
"Freewill" and "Jacob's Ladder" had been put down on cassette.<p>

    Eventually , they moved on to Sound Kitchen studios in North Toronto,
to lay down proper demo tapes, and then it was back to the road. Thus, they
were able to 'work in' the new tunes, before commencing the actual
recording of the album. This approach was to become standard practice in
the future.<p>

    "You can't really get in shape for the studio by sitting in a rehearsal
studio, like you can from playing a two-hour set, with soundchecks and
everything," states Alex. "Ever since <strong>Permanent Waves</strong>, we've made a point
of going out for at least a couple of weeks after writing and rehearsing."<p>

    Consequently, Rush headed off to England in September '79 and played
two concerts at Stafford's Bingley Hall, where they attracted over 20,000
fans, turning away thousands more. Shortly afterwards, it was back to the
studios. Whenever they had previously recorded in Canada, it had been at
Toronto Sound, but this time Rush chose to work at Le Studio, which is
located some 20 miles north of Montreal. They were swift to take advantage
of the surrounding countryside, which encompasses some 250 acres of land and
a private lake, by setting up microphones out in the open to capture the
sounds of nature.<p>

    The basic tracks for five numbers were laid down very quickly, and the
final song was originally supposed to be a medieval epic, entitled "Sir
Gawain And The Green Knight". However, after a good deal of deliberation,
the band considered the topic to be somewhat out of context with the rest
of the material and finally settled on "Natural Science".<p>

    <strong>Permanent Waves</strong> was mixed at London's Trident studios and hit record
stores in January, 1980. Gone were the "Cecil B. DeMille proportioned"
epics that had dominated the past few albums and in came shorter, more
direct songs. Neil Peart's lyrical approach had also taken a different turn
and, instead of basing his ideas on science fiction and fantasy works, he
appeared to be dealing with more down-to-earth matters. The drummer has
since claimed that he considers <strong>Permanent Waves</strong> to be "our first album
that was in touch with reality. It was about people dealing with
technology, instead of people dealing with some futuristic world or
symbols."<p>

    The first side of the Lp featured "The Spirit of Radio", "Freewill" and
the slickly constructed "Jacob's Ladder". There was a strong feeling of
modernization about the music and, at times,  Rush came across in quite a
sophisticated manner. However, they managed to retain their hard edge and
had definitely rolled in the 80's with a winner. Side two comprised three
tracks: "Entre Nous", "Different Strings" and the masterful "Natural
Science". <strong>Permanent Waves</strong> was an extremely colorful album and it was
hardly surprising that it hit the #4 position on the Billboard charts.<p>

    From January to mid-May, Rush toured America, playing multiple nights
in large venues in St. Louis (3), New York (4), Milwaukee (2), Chicago (4),
Seattle (2), San Francisco (2), the Los Angeles area (4), Detroit (2) and
Dallas (4). It's significant to note that they actually registered a profit
on the road for the first time.<p>

    Rush had definitely established themselves as a major force in the rock
world and, when they went to Britain in June, 1980, they were able to sell
out five nights at the Hammersmith Odeon in London. They made tapes of all
the UK gigs and originally inteded to follow up <strong>Permanent Waves</strong> with
their second in-concert album. However, as more fresh material emerged
during their soundchecks, the band decided to go for another studio Lp.<p>

    In July, the trio went to Toronto's Phase One studios and recorded the
song "Battlescar" with Max Webster, which later surfaced on the Websters'
<strong>Universal Juveniles</strong> album. From there, Rush retreated to a place called
Stony Lake and began pre-production of their own record. By the end of
August, it was back to Phase One for demo sessions. October saw a brief
American tour, during which new songs like "Tom Sawyer" and "Limelight"
were previewed. Rush then returned to Le Studio, where they spent the next
ten weeks recording <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>.<p>

    Released in February, 1981, the group's eighth studio output was a
rather more dark, haunting package than its predecessor, both from a
musical and lyrical point of view, and required a good deal of intense
listening to fully appreciate. The first track, "Tom Sawyer", was
co-written with Max Webster's Pye DuBois. Then came "Red Barchetta" and the
instrumental "YYZ", the title of which stemmed from the code lettering on
Toronto Airport luggage tags. Side two contained four songs: "Limelight",
"The Camera Eye", "Witch Hunt" and "Vital Signs". The latter echoed strong
hints of reggae, which no doubt surprised many Rush fans.<p>

    The "Moving Pictures" tour of the United States enabled Rush to become
one of the nation's top grossing live acts. Furthermore, they were the only
band to score three US platinum discs (for <strong>2112</strong>, <strong>All The World's A
Stage</strong> and <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>) in 1981. The trio also earned a Grammy
nomination for "YYZ" in the "Best Rock Instrumental" category.<p>

    The American dates stretched through until mid-summer, at which point
Rush headed back to the Laurentian hideaway of Le Studio to mix tapes for an
upcoming live album. <strong>Exit...Stage Left</strong> finally emerged in the fall of
'81, coinciding with a series of European concerts, and at the time Neil
Peart stated: "Such as it is, we're all very proud of this one. Everything
has improved so much since our last, somewhat uneven live effort -- that
was by a different group. Once again, it's a kind of anthology album; a
summation of the live highlights of our previous four studio albums and a
couple of older reincarnations."<p>

    Unlike <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong>, it didn't run in the style of a
complete concert performance and, rather than selecting one venue to
record, Rush had assembled tapes (about 50 rolls!) from a variety of places
on both sides of the Atlantic. While the first live album may hold greater
atmosphere, one couldn't fault the execution of material on <strong>Exit</strong>. It
kicked off with "The Spirit Of Radio", afterwhich came "Red Barchetta" and
"YYZ". The second side featured "A Passage To Bangkok", "Closer To The
Heart", "Beneath, Between And Behind" and "Jacob's Ladder". "Broon's Bane",
a 90-second previously unreleased acoustic passage, introduced "The Trees",
but the majority of side three was consumed by a lengthy rendition of
"Xanadu". Finally, affairs were brought to a close with "Freewill", "Tom
Sawyer" and "La Villa Strangiato". Wisely, Rush had avoided attempting to
reproduce the complete "Cygnus" saga!<p>

    Asked why the band decided to make another live Lp, Geddy explains: "I
guess there were a whole lot of reasons. One was that we felt our live
sound had changed so much that we figured we needed to up-date it on
record. I mean, <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong> was a whole lot different. But
doing a live record is also a great device to get a sort of hiatus between
albums and we really wanted that. We wanted to have a longer gap before
going back in the studio so that we could do some writing on our own."<p>

    Mind you, Geddy isn't particularly fond of in-concert recordings and
openly admits that he finds them a tedious exercise. "They're sort of
historical and very painful to do because there's nothing really creative
about them," he reasons. "You play the gigs and invariably whenever you're
recording you stiffen up and it's not the same. I hate doing them and in
some ways I'm almost sorry we did <strong>Exit</strong>.<p>

    Alex Lifeson seems to share the bass player's views and, when talking
to American rock writer, John Stix, he declared: "Live albums are always a
difficult thing. It's hard to get excited about them. In terms of a live
recording, <strong>Exit</strong> is very good and I'm happy with it in that respect. As an
example of our show, it's not as good as it could have been or possible
should have been. Live albums give us some breathing space to cleanse
ourselves and start on something fresh and new. When we were in the studio
doing <strong>Exit</strong>, Geddy and I were in another studio working on "Digital Man"
and "Subdivisions" from <strong>Signals</strong>. We were already geared up for another
record. I think that had something to do with the fact that we don't go
crazy over live records. I don't know if you'll ever hear another live
album from Rush. We enjoy the studio recordings much more than we do the
live ones."<p>

    And so, <strong>Exit...Stage Left</strong> closed another chapter in the Rush history.
Since the release of <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong>, the band's popularity had
grown by leaps and bounds. Happily, they had been able to maintain success
without compromise and as the liner notes of <strong>Exit</strong> stated: "For reasons
beyond our comprehension, we have become increasingly more popular, and
hence stretched ever more thinly among even more people. If sometimes we
can't give the time they deserve, to our friends and loved ones, we hope
they will understand and forgive us. After all, <strong>we</strong> didn't change,
everybody else did!"<p>
