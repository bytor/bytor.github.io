FACE 2 FACE with Alex Lifeson by Stewart Gilray of 'SOR'.
</font><br>
<em>As appeared in 'SOR #27 -- July 1994'</em>
</center><br><br><br>

Late on Friday the 22nd of April I received a fax from Atlantic
records. I thought what are Atlantic doing sending me a fax for
then I read the fax.<p>

<pre>
     "Dear Stewart,
          Management have confirmed your interview with Alex to take
     place after the Albany NY show on Tuesday the 3rd of May. Please
     confirm this time by return of fax."
</pre><p>

So on Monday morning I sent a fax to Atlantic, saying thanks for
the fax and the times were ok. Also that the interview would be
conducted by myself and Janet Balmer.<p>

I was later to discover that Atlantic never told Sean Son Hing or
Anyone else from SRO/Anthem about the confirmation. Incidentally
Sean is the bands PA for this tour. To cut a very long story very
short, only 1 media pass was forth coming. Because Atlantic
hadn't passed on my confirmation. Needless to say when I got back
to the UK I had a few words with them.<p>

Below is the interview, I was told to expect about 30 minutes but
I got a lot more than that.<p>
<hr><p>

<strong>
I told Alex how we had flown across from the UK to see the first
two shows of the tour in January, and how we were surprised that
the second show had had some of the stage show missing.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah it was like one thing after another, Jimmy (Johnson) had
probably the worst night ever. One thing after another with
the guitars, I mean he's just always on the ball, he forgot
a guitar change, He gave me a guitar that was out of tune he
gave it to me, it was hoooo, just constant. That was a nightmare
gig, and I wore these shoes, it was the only night I wore these
shoes (points to a picture of the himself that was on the inside
front cover of spirit 25), they're like huge giant shoes, I
couldn't hit the peddles hooo (laughs)."<p>

<strong>
I went on to tell him about the grief I had with the passes. That
there was only one pass when Atlantic said that there would be
two, and how nobody knew what was happening.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah I noticed, I got a fax from the office a couple of weeks
ago requesting the interview, I sent one back saying yeah I'll do
it, then I didn't hear anything after that until this afternoon,
when I was in the production office when you arrived."<p>

<strong>
Now that the general chit chat was over with It was time to get
down to the nitty gritty and ask Alex a few question about his
equipment for this tour, and indeed his equipment at home. The
first thing I wanted to know was why he changed from using
Signature guitars to PRS's in the middle of Presto tour.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, they (PRS) sent me a couple of guitars to try, and I loved
them straight out the cases, they felt fantastic, they played
really well, they were really well built, it was all, all the
things that Signature wanted to be, but Signature wanted to keep
the cost down, and PRS's are very expensive guitars, and they
just realised after a while that this couldn't be done, so they
ended up cutting corners, then company went out of business."<p>

<strong>
I went on to ask about his choice of pickups he used with the
Signatures' and in the PRS he uses for Time Stand Still.<p>
</strong>

"I used Evans pickups exclusively back then as they have a
particular sound that I like. The humbuckers, don't have that
characteristic, the sound is very clean and very bright and very
wirey which, was at a place that was indicative of a place that I
was at, sound wise."<p>

<strong>
I wanted to know if Alex is always on the look out for new
guitars. So I thought the best way to ask him would be to ask if
had seen anything about the new guitar by Laravee (The original
manufacturers of the Signature guitars) which is due to be
launched at the NAMM show in January 95.<p>
</strong>

"No. No I have no interest really, I have a good relationship
with PRS, I have probably half a dozen guitars, currently from
them, that I use for different things, I'm quite happy with the
selection that I have, and I've brought my Les Paul back out and
I use the tele and my strat and stuff like that in my studio, and
my old reliable guitars, as well as the PRS's so I'm really
covered and I'm not really interested at looking at other stuff.
It's kinda funny to say that but, at this point It just happens
to be how I feel. "<p>

<strong>
I guess you're happy with them.<p>
</strong>

"You know, and I kinda like. I was never a collector and now,
just because we've been around for so long, the early guitars
that I had, are collectors, guitars, so, yeah I've sorta become a
collector with the first guitars that I had, there are odours of
older antique' guitars."<p>

<strong>
The question I asked next led to an 'On the road' type story. You
must have a hell of a lot of guitars by now?<p>
</strong>

"No, Yeah, But I've given a lot away to charities. Although the
one guitar I'll keep for ever is the trusty old 335 (Gibson)"<p>

<strong>
Do you think you will ever bring it out on the road again?<p>
</strong>

"I kinda swore I wouldn't, after the PA fell on it (Laugh). At the
Nassau coliseum out on Long Island, we were playing with Blue
Oyster Cult, in seventy hmm.. seventy eight, seventy nine. Yeah
it was Hemispheres, yeah that's right it was the Hemispheres
tour. One of the horns slipped off the suspended PA and it fell
back, didn't fall on the guitar or anything, but once it hit the
stage it fell over the 12 string and that knocked the 335 over,
and it took a chip out of the headstock. The 12 string was really
screwed up."<p>

<strong>
The Gibson 6/12 double neck?<p>
</strong>

"Yeah It was the Gibson."<p>

<strong>
Has that changed colours over the years?<p>
</strong>

"No, not really, I had the 2 of them, the red one which was
repainted black after this accident, I mean it sheared the
strings of the 12 string, pulled a pickup out, took a chunk
of wood out of the body. I had it all re-built. I also had the
second white one I'm using now. Incidentally I gave that black
one to Eric Johnson, last tour, we were going through Austin, we
got together for diner, I've admireded him for years and I made a
point of bringing the guitar down and giving it to him, and a
couple of months later, I saw him, he said I'm really sorry but
I've got to tell ya, the guitar was stolen. So somewhere out
there's this guitar.."<p>

<strong>
Next I thought I'd ask about his rack and also the return of the
Marshalls. I believe you are now using some of the new Digitech
gear, namely the TSR-24 and the DHP-55, what do you think of
them?<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, I like the Digitech stuff, I've been using the Digitech
stuff for a while. Some of the effects units, are not for me, but
these (TSR24 DHP55) replace a few older units I had, and I'm
trying to rely less and less on them. Most of the stuff from the
last record, Counterparts has very little in the way of effects,
so it's really for the older material. But I find that it's good
clean sounding stuff, they have a unit, that has come out with an
analog pre-amp and effects built in to it, called the GSP 2101.
I had a chance to, mess around with a beta version that they had,
but I haven't seen anything since. I've seen advertisements for
it, that sounded pretty good actually, I used it at home straight
into the console so we had the benefit of a tube pre-amp and it
did sound quite good."<p>

<strong>
I was quite surprised to see that you've gone back to using tube
pre-amplification after such a long time of using nothing but
solid state stuff.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, well it was convenient using solid state. I thought at the
time, if you had a sound in your head you could achieve it
through some diligent work, whether it's tubes or not, but once I
got the Marshalls into the studio and the Peavey 5150 as well, I
thought naahh you can't. There is just something about the valves
that you just can't get with solid state. Now, I personally think
that there are advantages to solid state over the valves. There
is something in the sustain and something in the clarity you
loose going back to valve, but definitely for the chunky, warmer
distortion you can't beat it, and the Marshalls do look
great (laugh)."<p>

<strong>
In your current rack system, are you using a pre-amp or..<p>
</strong>

"Nahh I'm just using the Marshalls. The other thing I like about
the Marshalls is, I turn around, and I like what I see, this wall
of Stacks."<p>

<strong>
I suppose you missed that.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah I did miss them. I liked the idea of being more compact,
and you know having a pretty good sound out of a small system.
But now I get off on seeing those cabinets back there."<p>

<strong>
One of the US magazines did an article on you, in there, there
was a quote, something like, You liked standing in front of those
stacks as you could feel your pants waving in the wind.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, (laugh), yeah, I don't turn them up that loud, in
rehearsals I did, there were a couple of days in rehearsals we
cranked them up, just for the fun of it.<p>

<strong>
Next I thought I'd ask him about what B-Man had nick named
'Lerxst sound' in Visions. That's the guitar sound that Alex used
through out HYF. What I got was an answer that led on to a
discussion about recording.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, that's not quite accurate. Lerxst sound was, I had a
little 8 track porta studio, It was a travelling studio, we used
to record at Toronto sound, so this became Lerxst sound, and we
would do all our writing and preliminary pre-production, and
recording on this thing, and that became Lerxst sound."<p>

<strong>
This time around on Counterparts you used a more up to date
method for the pre-production work. You used some computer
software,  CuBase Audio, was that on the Mac system's.<p>
</strong>

"That was a nightmare for us, It was the first time, I think that
anyone had every used CuBase Audio to that extent. For jingle
stuff and small memory things it's ok, but we were putting so
much data in to that thing. During editing and moving around we
had a lot of problems, probably in eight weeks of total recording
time we lost a total of two weeks on downtime, it was just
continuous crashing."<p>

<strong>
Would you use it again?<p>
</strong>

"Well, in all fairness this was the second version I think that
we started with and since then I think they've released four or
five versions. So it's been updated all along, and protools is a
much friendlier system than when we first started. Yeah I would
use it, I mean its a great tool for song writing."<p>

<strong>
It has its advantages over normal recording. like Editing and
messing with what you've just recorded without having to re-recording.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, exactly you can do a variety of effects, and stuff, to
see if it sounds you know good, with an extended chorus, or
without a chorus, or move this bridge here, you can do a lot of
your editing, and arranging that way, then hear it, without as
you say, having to re-record it everytime which is what we used
to do."<p>

<strong>
I heard lately that you know a have a full home studio, is
that correct.<p>
</strong>

"Yes, I always, I've had one for the last 12 years, and at the
home I live in now, for 9 years, yeah I guess 8 or 9 years, yeah
I have a full studio. It started out as a full 24 track analog
studio, now it's down to 16 tracks, very mobile digital studio.
It's a lot more, movable, which is nice, the room itself is fully
floating room built within a room, so I go down there and crank
it up and no one can hear me upstairs (laugh). My son Adrian is
actually taking it over, he has got the porta studio in there,
and he's using my system."<p>

<strong>
Is he a guitarist as well?<p>
</strong>

"Yeah he has been playing for about 3 years, he's 17. He's into
it, actually he made me a tape, and it sounded pretty good."<p>

<strong>
Oh no, another Lifeson (laughs).<p>
</strong>

"Yeah (laughs), stop that I want you to be a doctor (laughs)"<p>

<strong>
The next logical step was to talk about the recording of
Counterparts. After listening to Counterparts I felt that you
possibly had fun recording this record?<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, it was. It was also a bit of grind, you know at certain
stages as always, but we find that we are so well prepared when
we get into the studio. Neil did all the drum tracks in 2 to 3
days. Which is tough on me, because I like to use that time, to
really develop all the guitar stuff. It gives me a chance to work
on the song and come back to it, and familiarise myself with it,
with 2 days for drum tracks and about 5 days for bass, it gave me
about a week to get myself really prepared, but I was well prepared 
as it was anyways going in, so, it went well."<p>

<strong>
Do you work out all your guitar parts before you go in, or do you
learn the basic, structures, record them then wing the rest?<p>
</strong>

"I used to prior to Power Windows, I used to have probably half
the guitar stuff prepared, I had an idea at least in my head, and
the fun was doing it in the studio, consequently you were in the
studio for six months, doing stuff, but since then, certainly,
through, Power Windows and, Hold Your Fire, having the keyboards
built up to the extent that they were, I had to be very well
prepared after that, there was no more fun (Laughs). Which is kind
of a drag, but. In other words at this stage I'd much rather be
well prepared and know exactly what I'm going to do when I go in,
so there has been benefit. In our records like the last record,
the guitar plays a much more prominent roll, I like that (laugh)."<p>

<strong>
When you were touring UK last with the Bones show you did an
interview, where you said, "I think the next record will see the
guitar feature even more. Mind you, I don't know about the
others, but that's my plan anyway." I guess "the others" agreed
with you.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, It's what we all felt about it, you know we talked about
it on the last tour, many times on the bus we talked about what
direction we wanted to go with, we didn't know specifically what
we wanted to do, but we knew, we wanted to pull the keyboards
back and push the guitar out more, we were listening to a lot of
different stuff at the time, Pearl Jam was just starting to get
on the wall, Nirvana and a lot of other west coast bands. There
was something in that music that reminded us of our music, and
they all sighted us as an influence, we started thinking about,
what we were all about you know what was the core of the band,
how, how much we enjoyed the three of us, just being a three
piece together, Geddy and I facing Neil and playing that's what
we got off on when we were a lot younger."<p>

<strong>
People, both in the press and people I've talked to have said
that Counterparts is the best Album since Moving Pictures. You
wouldn't take that view, would you? I guess to you each album
you've just done is the best?<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, I would probably always say the most recent album is the
best work, probably because it's the most recent work you've
done, and your proud of that. But when I listen to records that
we've done, that I haven't listened to in a long time, there are
a lot of things I really enjoy about them. Because I haven't
listened to them in a long time and I think they stand on those
merits. Except for maybe Signals. I think Signals was the one
record in the second half that suffered."<p>

<strong>
There are some great songs on that album, Analog kid, The Weapon
and indeed Countdown in its own way. You haven't done a song like
that since.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, yeah they were never really developed to the point they
should have been, that was really a turning point with Terry
(Brown). We really needed Terry to sort of give us that direction
at that point, like a proper producer and our relationship was
too familiar, too easy, and it lacked. That was really, you know
the reason for the breakup in our relationship."<p>

<strong>
Without trying to sound too critical, the production is a bit
ragged in some places on that album.<p>
</strong>

"I hate it!! To be honest with you, when I listen to it  now, I
can't believe that the guitar, I have to blame myself for it, but
we were trying something new at the time. My recollection of
working on that record is not as pleasant as some other records.
Just like Grace Under Pressure, was a very very difficult record
for us to make. But when I hear songs, when I hear subdivisions,
or I heard, Digital Man the other day on the radio, the  guitar
is so in the background, and it really, you can't. You know it
really bothers me that it ended up being that way, but you know,
you get so locked into it, it's tunnel vision, and you get used
to hearing it a certain way day after day after day, month after
month after month. After a while it seems normal to you, seems
the way it should be. Now we're a lot more sensible about the way
we do things."<p>

<strong>
I guess it's almost like your x months down the production line
and you can see this light at the end of the tunnel, you just
want to get out of there.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, exactly your tired of being in the dark you want out."<p>

<strong>
I thought it was time to ask Alex about the current tour. About
the set list and trials and tribulations of being on the road.
To be completely honest with you Alex, I was a little surprised
by the structure of the setlist. For example I thought you'd do
an encore along similar lines to the one on the Bones tour, you
know a few songs thrown together as a medley. It appeared that
you enjoyed playing that sort of a thing. This time you're doing
Force Ten and YYZ in their entirety with a bit of Cygnus tagged
on.<p>
</strong>

"I really liked the medley on the Bones tour, I thought it was a
really fun thing to listen too, for a listener and for me
playing, I really enjoyed playing it. It gave you a chance to go
through five or six songs and have fun with it, I think I maybe
prefer that, the problem was that we ended playing  more from
Counterparts than we normally would have from a new album. We're
playing six tracks from the album. Then trying to be
representative of the other albums, is really really tough."<p>

<strong>
You're not doing anything from the first 4 albums or Grace Under
Pressure.<p>
</strong>

"We did have had Distant Early Warning mixed in with the medley,
but we had to cut it, cos we were running out of time, in terms
of the length of the set. As it is we've added Bravado for this
last  run. That's just because we wanted to get it on tape, we've
been recording all the shows since the beginning of the tour so
that has been a bit of a problem."<p>

<strong>
What was the motivation behind picking the six tracks that you
did from Counterparts. Obviously Animate and Stick it Out.
Nobody's Hero as it was a single, Leave that thing alone, as it's
the instrumental from the album, and the other two.<p>
</strong>

"Uhmmm, what are the other 2?!?!?"<p>

<strong>
At this point both Alex and I spend a moment trying to remember
the other two songs.<p>
</strong>

"Cold Fire and Double Agent. Double Agent we ended up playing,  I
didn't think that we would do that live, but. It's kind of a
quirky song for us, cos it's a little bit reminiscent of our
older style, piecing different bits of music together, and then
we had ideas for the presentation of it, I think that really made
the decision for us to do it."<p>

<strong>
You have the film, the sync track, the mirrors, the general
lights and the flames. We talked to Howard (Ungerleider) he said
it is probably the most complex thing he's done production wise,
because there's so much happening. By the way it works.<p>
</strong>

"Thanks. Exactly, with all that happening, and the reactions of
the crowd we know we've made the right choice."<p>

<strong>
I was hoping you would do Cut To The Chase.<p>
</strong>

"I wanted to play that song but then again Geddy wanted to do
Alien Shores, by the end of it we would be doing the whole album,
and that isn't fair for the rest of the material, and we can't
play a set anymore that's over 2 hours, as it is, I think we're
probably about 2:15, 2:20 the way the set is now, and it's a
little long in terms of pacing, and its a little long, in terms
of wanting to play that much."<p>

<strong>
Cut To The Chase has a Hammond organ at the end of the second
verse, it's subtle, it just creeps in there and out again, I
think that really adds to the song, and maybe even gives the song
the status of being a Rush Classic. It's also song where you can
crank it up?<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, in the song, the guitar is fairly straight ahead, with
choppy  chords. We really tried to keep the keyboards as pure as
we could, less samples and synth stuff, more Hammond, we even
rolled in a B-3 with full Leslie and the whole thing. We really
wanted to be a lot more organic again."<p>

<strong>
You are doing Time Stand Still on this tour again, and you have a
keyboard and Taurus pedals out there. Wouldn't it have been
easier to sequence those parts and keep your side of the stage
clear?<p>
</strong>

"I suppose we could have sequenced it but, I like playing it, and
it's kind of fun to have the keyboard standing there, for that,
little moment."<p>

<strong>
I believe you had to cancel a show last week?<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, in Washington, we were playing in Washington to 15,000
people and Geddys voice was cracking up after the third song, and
that's pretty tough for him, it's frustrating, it's embarrassing,
so we knocked Hampton out. He was at the peak, I was on the other
side of the peak, and Neil had just gotten this particular bug,
and with 50 guys living together all the time, it's very easy for
these sort of things to go through everybody like wildfire."<p>

<strong>
There's 3 shows to go now, Rochester, Montreal and Toronto. Are
you looking forward to the Toronto show? It's your home town and
it sold out in something like 3 hours.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah that's a nightmare gig. I stopped looking forward to
playing Toronto in 1979 I think. It's just that it's home town.
It's insane you get ticket requests, you know from people you
haven't seen in 20 years. It's very busy backstage, it's really a
nightmare gig."<p>

<strong>
Well now it's the part that you've all been waiting for. What are
the guys up to next. I started by asking about his rumoured solo
project.<p>
</strong>

"Well I have to do something for 3 months or so, Geddys' wife is
having a baby, we cut the tour back. Normally we would be out
until the beginning  of July we cut it back to two months and we
squeezed in three weeks or so worth of dates. So in a lot of ways
this tour has been very, very growling for us, I mean a tough
tour, there's a lot of flu and colds, and stuff like that."<p>

<strong>
You mentioned earlier that you've recorded every show on this
tour, are you going to be doing a live album and video next?<p>
</strong>

"We haven't done any video stuff, the intention at the beginning
of the tour was to record this material for a live album, which
would be our next release in the new year, since then we've had
second thoughts about doing a live album next. In fact we've had
some discussions about doing another studio record first, then
going out and touring that, pick up some other old material, we
can't put Closer to the Heart on another live album, or Tom
Sawyer, it's songs like that. It has really got to be made up of
stuff, really from Presto on. So we thought maybe it would be
wiser to do another studio album, then go out and tour that, come
up with some more material, then come out with like a double CD
of live stuff. That's just one alternative, there are a couple of
others, we haven't really nailed anything yet."<p>

<strong>
What about the 20th anniversary tour, "An evening with Rush" that
has been mentioned in other interviews?<p>
</strong>

"That coincides with the live stuff. There was talk about doing
something from the first ten years in the first half, then take a
short intermission and show a film covering the history of the
band, then come back and do another set covering the next ten
years. But we got to thinking. Saying that it's 20 years, is like
saying it's the end of something and we never want to say it's
the end of anything, we want to keep on going. Like the Grateful
Dead (Laugh). That is another of the options open to us but, as I
said we got to thinking, it has been 20 years as a recording act,
but Geddy and I have been playing together for 25 years."<p>

<strong>
Well there you go looks like we're going to get another studio
album first then a possibility of a European tour during '95.<p>

I wanted to find out if there was any particular reason why there
had been no single releases in the UK. So I did the logical thing
and asked about the singles releases in the States.
You've released Stick it Out and Nobody's Hero in North America
and I understand your also about to release Animate as well?<p>
</strong>

"Definitely not. We did the first two purely as radio promo
singles, and  the accompanying videos. We feel that that, is
enough. With the videos you have to make an interpretation of the
song, and it kind of limits the viewer to the meaning of the
lyrics. So instead of letting people come up with their own views
it blinkers them."<p>

<strong>
We were surprised that East West productions in London didn't
release any radio promos in the UK.<p>
</strong>

"What do they know we exist?"<p>

<strong>
After hearing this response from Alex I was a little surprised to
say the least. So after getting over the shock of what he just I
continued.<p>

What do you mean?<p>
</strong>

"When we came across to the UK for the Bones tour we contacted
them to get some information, and they didn't even know that we
were on their books."<p>

<strong>
That's not really what you want to hear is it.<p>
</strong>

"You're telling me, there is other stuff as well, that we feel
they could have done, or could do."<p>

<strong>
Anything in particular?<p>
</strong>

"I'd prefer not to mention anything."<p>

<strong>
I thought it best to change the subject here to something a
little less political. For inspiration, do you ever get ideas for
guitar parts when you're doing something completely different,
like playing golf?<p>
</strong>

"You just do it, it's hard to really describe where it comes
from, it's just something that you do. When you read the lyrics,
or when you play a note or two, it triggers something, and it
just sort of comes out."<p>

<strong>
The main riff in Stick it Out, with a drop D tuning, I wouldn't
have thought that would be something you would come up with
while just twiddling away on the guitar.<p>
</strong>

"No, but I did, that's exactly how it happened. I thought I'll
have a screw around with some alternative tunings, I dropped the
bottom E down to D, and just sort of played the riff.  I have a
cassette at home that is all de-tuned stuff when I was working on
different ideas. The original version of where Stick it Out came
from had some other really weird stuff in it, but it was a little
too weird (laughs)."<p>

<strong>
I was a little surprised to see you use a Les Paul for Stick it
Out live. As Les Pauls don't have tremolo systems, so obviously
you couldn't play the original solo, which is full of tremolo.<p>
</strong>

"The solo does yeah, I used the Paul Reed Smith in the studio for
the solo."<p>

<strong>
I thought you may have used the PRS for Stick it Out and the Les
Paul for Cold Fire, as there is not a tremendous amount of
tremolo in that, just subtle bits during the versus.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah, I used my tele for that in the studio, but with Stick it
out live I wanted it to have a really, really heavy sound to it,
and what better than a Les Paul."<p>

<strong>
I read somewhere that you were trying to cut back on using the
tremolo as you felt that you were relying on it too much, and
consequently your finger bending was suffering.<p>
</strong>

"That's true, which is why I've reverted back to playing a D
chord in the second verse of Force Ten, where I used to play the
D harmonic on the D string. I also think that the harmonic didn't
really translated very well, but if I played it with a D chord it
just pumps better, instead of hitting that thing. It worked in
the studio, hit the note, harmonic, fine, but I found live it
needed just a bit of gusto, especially with the next part."<p>

<strong>
The solo in Double Agent is a bizarre little piece of guitar. I
thought that at the start of the solo you were playing the A note
on the G and using something like an IPS-33B (Guitar harmonizer)
to get that sound. When we saw you do the solo in Pensacola at
the start of the tour it was like ahh that's how it's done.<p>
</strong>

"it's just on the A string, start at the 12th and work my way
down.  The thing I love about it is, it's so simple, but it
worked, it worked in the song and it's kind of cool, and there's
a little tapping at the end which I swore I would never do, but
it's not like it was (Laughs) just a little tapping not like a
solo thing."<p>

<strong>
I wanted to find out if Alex had any views on the differences
between American and European radio airplay. We ended up having a
a conversation about how destructive shows like MTV are.
Here in the States and in Canada you have dedicated rock music
stations, but in Europe there are basically none, do you think
that lets down rock music in general, in respect of publicity?<p>
</strong>

"I don't know what to think these days, you know with MTV, and
with video, and with that whole thing, I don't just how important
radio is any more."<p>

<strong>
It's unfortunate.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah it is unfortunate, because television can dictate a lot
more to you, than just the music, and that's what the charts,
and TV do, it's not representative of what the youth of today is
about or the music. It's something, it's just a vehicle for
selling millions of dollars worth of commercial goods."<p>

<strong>
Kids just sit and watch MTV and get hooked on the imagery.<p>
</strong>

"Yeah! and they don't care about the music, which is a real
shame, as usually the music gives greater images than the
visuals."<p>

<strong>
Ok, Alex, well I'd like thank you for giving this interview, this
late in the tour, and we hope to see you across in the UK, on the
next tour. Whatever or whenever it maybe.<p>
</strong>

"Alright, I just hope the others don't mind too much about
waiting for me (laugh)."<p>

<hr> <P>

That was it just over 1 hours worth of conversation. I'd like to
thank the following people for making it all happen, also for
helping me out with the questions etc.<p>
