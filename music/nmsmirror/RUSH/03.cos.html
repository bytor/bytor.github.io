Bastille Day
-------- ---
There's no bread, let them eat cake
There's no end to what they'll take
Flaunt the fruits of noble birth
Wash the salt into the earth
But they're marching to Bastille Day
La guillotine will claim her bloody prize
Free the dungeons of the innocent
The king will kneel, and let his kingdom rise

Bloodstained velvet, dirty lace
Naked fear on every face
See them bow their heads to die
As we would bow as they rode by

And we're marching to Bastille Day
La guillotine will claim her bloody prize
Sing, o choirs of cacophony
The king has kneeled, to let his kingdom rise.

Lessons taught but never learned
All around us anger burns
Guide the future by the past
Long ago the mould was cast

For they marched up to Bastille Day
La guillotine -- claimed her bloody prize
Hear the echoes of the centuries
Power isn't all that money buys

I Think I'm Going Bald
- ----- --- ----- ----
I looked in the mirror today
My eyes just didn't seem so bright
I've lost a few more hairs
I think I'm going bald
I think I'm going bald
Seems like only yesterday
We would sit and talk of dreams all night
Dreams of youth 
And simple truths
Now we're so involved
So involved with life

Walk down vanity fair
Memory lane everywhere
Wall Street shuffles there
Dressed in flowing hair

Once we loved the flowers
Now we ask the price of the land
Once we would take water
But now it must be wine
Now we've been 
And now we've seen
What price peace of mind
Take a piece of my mind

My life is slipping away
I'm aging every day
But even when I'm grey
I'll still be grey my way

<font size=+1><strong>Geddy reflects on the older songs:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Geddy Lee (1993 Raw magazine): </strong>"A lot of the early 
stuff I'm really proud of," he says. "Some of it sounds really goofy, but 
some of it stands up better than I gave it credit for. As weird as my voice 
sounds when I listen back, I certainly dig some of the arrangements. I can't 
go back beyond <strong>2112</strong> really, because that starts to get a bit 
hairy for me, and if I hear "Lakeside Park" on the radio I cringe. What a 
lousy song! Still, I don't regret anything that I've done!"</dd>

Lakeside Park
-------- ----
Midway hawkers calling 
Try your luck with me
Merry-go-round wheezing 
The same old melody
A thousand ten cent wonders
Who could ask for more
A pocketful of silver
The key to heaven's door

Lakeside Park
Willows in the breeze
Lakeside Park
So many memories
Laughing rides
Midway lights
Shining stars on summer nights

Days of barefoot freedom
Racing with the waves
Nights of starlit secrets
Crackling driftwood flames
Drinking by the lighthouse
Smoking on the pier
Still we saw the magic 
Fading every year

Everyone would gather
On the twenty fourth of May
Sitting in the sand 
To watch the fireworks display
Dancing fires on the beach
Singing songs together
Though it's just a memory
Some memories last forever

The Necromancer
--- -----------
<strong>I. Into Darkness</strong>

As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky, the three travelers, men of
Willow Dale, emerge from the forest shadow. Fording the River Dawn, they turn
south, journeying into the dark and forbidding lands of the Necromancer.
Even now the intensity of his dread power can be felt, weakening the body and
saddening the heart.  Ultimately they will become empty, mindless spectres,
stripped of will and soul.  Only their thirst for freedom gives them hunger for
vengeance...

Silence shrouds the forest
As the birds announce the dawn
Three trav'llers ford the river
And southward journey on
The road is lined with peril
The air is charged with fear
The shadow of his nearness
Weighs like iron tears

<strong>II. Under the Shadow</strong>

Shreds of black cloud loom in overcast skies.  The Necromancer keeps watch 
with his magic prism eyes.  He views all his lands and is already aware
of the three helpless invaders trapped in his lair...

Brooding in the tower
Watching o'er his land
Holding ev'ry creature
Helplessly they stand
Gaze into his prisms
Knowing they are near
Lead them to the dungeons
Spectres numb with fear
They bow defeated

<strong>III. Return of the Prince</strong>

Enter the Champion.
Prince By-Tor appears to battle for freedom from chains of long years.
The spell has been broken...the Dark Lands are bright, the Wraith of the
Necromancer soars away...in the night.

Stealthily attacking
By-Tor slays his foe
The men are free to run now
From labyrinths below
The Wraith of Necromancer
Shadows through the sky
Another land to darken
With evil prism eye...

<font size=+1><strong>Alex on the lyrics for The Fountain of Lamneth</font>
</strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Alex Lifeson (1983 interview): </strong>"Ged and Neil wrote the 
lyrics for The Fountain of Lamneth, and he thought it would be kind of nice 
to try to incorporate a very loose concept in it by having a starting point 
and ending point which would go from the beginning of side 2 [to] the end of 
side 2 and it would be one complete story, but broken up, so that it could be 
individual songs that, unless you look closely, wouldn't necessarily relate 
to each other."</dd></dl>

<font size=+1><strong>Alex on No One at the Bridge</font></strong><br><br>
<dd>
<em>I recall from our last meeting together that Steve Hackett was your major 
influence from the progressive movement.</em></dd><P> 

<dd><strong>Alex Lifeson (1984 Guitar magazine): </strong>"Yes, Steve Hackett 
is so articulate and melodic, precise and flowing.  I 
think our <strong>Caress of Steel</strong> period is when I was most 
influenced by him.  
There's even a solo on that album which is almost a steal from his style of 
playing.  It's one of my favorites, called 'No One at the Bridge'."</dd>

The Fountain Of Lamneth
--- -------- -- -------
<strong>I. In the Valley</strong>

I am born
I am me
I am new
I am free
Look at me
I am young
Sight unseen
Life unsung

My eyes have just been opened
And they're open very wide
Images around me
Don't identify inside
Just one blur I recognize
The one that soothes and feeds
My way of life is easy
And as simple are my needs

Yet my eyes are drawn toward
The mountain in the east
Fascinates and captivates
Gives my heart no peace
The mountain holds the sunrise
In the prison of the night
Till bursting forth from rocky chains
The valley floods with light

Living one long sunrise
For to me all things are new
I've never watched the sky grow pale
Or strolled through fields of dew
I do not know of dust to dust
I live from breath to breath
I live to climb that mountain to
The Fountain of Lamneth

<strong>II. Didacts and Narpets</strong>

Listen...

<strong>III. No One At the Bridge</strong>

Crying back to consciousness
The coldness grips my skin
The sky is pitching violently
Drawn by shrieking winds
Seaspray blurs my vision
Waves roll by so fast
Save my ship of freedom
I'm lashed helpless to the mast

Call out for direction
And there's no one there to steer
Shout out for salvation
But there's no one there to hear
Cry out supplication
For the maelstrom is near
Scream out desperation
But no one cares to hear

Remembering when first I held
The wheel in my own hands
I took the helm so eagerly
And sailed for distant lands
But now the sea's too heavy
And I just don't understand
Why must my crew desert me
When I need a guiding hand

<strong>IV. Panacea</strong>

The whiteness of confusion
Is unfolding from my mind
I stare around in wonder
Have I left my life behind

I catch the scent of ambergris
And turn my head... surprised
My gaze is caught and held
And I am helpless, mesmerized

Panacea -- liquid grace
Oh let me touch your fragile face
Enchantment falls around me
And I know I cannot leave

Here's a meaning for my life
A shelter from the storm
Pacify my troubles with
Her body, soft and warm
Naked in our unity
A smile for every tear
Gentle hands that promise me
Comfort through the years
Yet I know I must be gone
Before the light of dawn

Panacea -- passion pure
I can't resist your gentle lure
My heart will lie beside you
And my wandering body grieves

<strong>V. Bacchus Plateau</strong>

Another endless day
Silhouettes of grey
Another glass of wine
Drink with eyes that shine
To days without that chill at morning
Long nights time out of mind

Draw another goblet
From the cask of '43
Crimson misty memory
Hazy glimpse of me
Give me back my wonder
  -- I've something more to give
I guess it doesn't matter
  -- There's not much more to live

Another foggy dawn
The mountain almost gone
Another doubtful fear
The road is not so clear
My soul grows ever weary
And the end is ever near

<strong>VI. The Fountain</strong>

Look... the mist is rising
And the sun is peaking through
See, the steps grow lighter
As I reach their final few
Hear, the dancing waters
I must be drawing near
Feel, my heart is pounding
With embattled hope and fear

Now, at last I fall before
The Fountain of Lamneth
I thought I would be singing
But I'm tired... out of breath
Many journeys end here
But, the secret's told the same
Life is just a candle
And a dream must give it flame

The key, the end, the answer
Stripped of their disguise
Still it's all confusion
And tears spring to my eyes
Though I've reached a signpost
It's really not the end
Like Old Sol behind the mountain
I'll be coming up again...

I'm in motion
I am still
I am crying
I am still
I'm together
I'm apart
I'm forever
At the start

Still... I am
