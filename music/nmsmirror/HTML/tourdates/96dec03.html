Rush brings best of old and new to Reunion appearance
</font><p>

Dallas -- Rush began putting out records in 1974, graduated to headliner
status two years later, was packing arenas soon afterward, and has since
notched up a string of rock radio favorites with a frequency matched by
hardly any other long-running progressive/hard rock act.<p>

As a result, the drawback to going to see the band live has, for years now,
been that the Canadian trio just couldn't play as wide a selection of the old
and the new as their volume of material dictated.<p>

The band's decision to do a long, career-retrospective show while featuring the
strong, stripped-down hard rock of the new Test For Echo was exactly what was
needed. Last night's show at a fairly full but not packed Reunion Arena was
the best show I've seen the band do -- and that's going back to 1978.<p>

Rush's early material tended to bombast and ponderous progressive rock, but
since 1980's Permanent Waves, the band (bassist/vocalist/keyboardist Geddy
Lee, guitarist/vocalist Alex Lifeson and drummer/lyricist Neil Peart) has
often struck a good balance between harder, intricate fare and more
pop-oriented songs. In other words, they found a middle ground, a way for the
two sides of their musical personality to complement each other.<p>

And hearing all the best stuff back-to-back-to-back, from Closer to the Heart
and the ecology fable The Trees to more recent fare such as Nobody's Hero and
Animate, is to appreciate the group's strengths all over again, from their
nimble, muscular ensemble playing to Lifeson's tasteful hard rock guitar work
to Peart's adult, thoughtful lyrical turns.<p>

The tough Echo material, such as the instrumental Limbo, the poppier Half the
World and the thunderous Driven, was just the icing on the proverbial cake,
solid songs that point to a renewed artistic future, even if the empty seats
displayed the band's slowly declining fortunes in the marketplace. With
different lighting schemes for every song, and the themes and lyrics to
Driven, The Trees, Half the World and others underscored by well-made, often
intriguing videos, this was state-of-the-art latter-day art-rock by a band
that has stood up quite well over the years.

Rush rolls at Reunion
</font><br>
Art rockers show longevity during Tuesday night show<p>
<strong>By Al Brumley</strong><P>

Here's an unsolicited tip for Rush next time they come to town:  Open
with Analog Kid instead of Dreamline and sub in Circumstances for Red
Sector A, and by God, you've got yourself a show.<p>

Not that Tuesday's concert at Reunion Arena wasn't a kick in the
sternum, but things got off to a critically slow start with Dreamline
and didn't improve much with Big Money.<p>

And there were other things that provided cause for concern: a few
anxious look between guitarist Alex Lifeson and bassist Geddy Lee; Mr.
Lee's stumbling over a lyric here and there.  Not even Red Barchetta
pulled them totally out of their funk.<p>

The eighth song, The Trees, thankfully and finally shook the dust off,
even prompting a rare smile from an unusually grim Neil Peart.<p>

Of course, even when they're not totally in sync, Alex, Geddy and Neil
can still peel the paint better than just about anyone around -- enough
anyway to make you think twice about those Primus comparisons.<p>

And once Tuesday's show -- before 12,500 we-know-all-the-lyrics fans --
got rolling, the band's 20-plus years on the road paid off with a
powerful ear-splitting roar.<p>

There was no opening act -- with all those songs, who needs one?  The
band crisscrossed its catalog, including such staples as Closer to the
Heart and Subdivisions, along with cuts from its new album, Test for
Echo.<p>

The big surprise was the complete 2112 Medley, expertly played and
milked for all its gloppy, Arthur C. Clarke-ian splendor.  It also
featured what had to have been one of the best light shows in Reunion
Arena history.<p>

It's amazing to think that these guys are still getting away with this
art-rock stuff.  But they're less enigmatic and precious than Yes and
they're less cantankerous than Emerson, Lake and Palmer, and they've
aged a heck of a lot more gracefully than Jethro Tull (with the
possible exception of Mr. Lee, who's starting to look like a startling
cross between Howard Stern and Mother Teresa).<p>

Intermission came at precisely 9:30, but even then the band didn't stop
entertaining.  After the "Let's all go to the lobby!" cartoon, they
played trailers from old biker films, including Hell's Belles ("Two
chicks, two guys and one out-of-sight cycle").<p>

Unfortunately, deadline loomed before Mr. Peart's always-interesting
drum solo and the scheduled show-ender, YYZ.  But Test for Echo sounded
great, and the guy in front of me, who has seen Rush 18 times, swore
that the end of the show would kick the first half's rear.  Chance are,
he was right.<p>
