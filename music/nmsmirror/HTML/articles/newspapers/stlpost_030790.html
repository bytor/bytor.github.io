<font size=+1>Rush brings plenty of power to stage</font><br>
<b>by Louise King</b><p>

FORGET all your preconceived notions about rock concerts. Not
since Pink Floyd has a group redefined the experience like Rush
did Monday night at The Arena. Even if the Canadian trio's brand
of hard rock isn't your cup of tea, the flawlessly executed show,
complete with brilliant sound and lighting systems, as well as an
array of lasers and other special effects, was worth the price of
admission. <p>

After 16 years, it's still amazing the kind of power these three
individuals can bring to bear on a concert stage. Great crashing
waves of sound flooded the nearly sold-out hall as Geddy Lee
easily manipulated bass and keyboards, while guitarist Alex
Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart added their own special punch.
While the use of synthesizers helped the band approximate the
recorded versions of its songs, there were enough impromptu
moments in the set, most notably during Lifeson's solos, to
maintain the audience's attention. <p>

Touring behind their 1989 LP, "Presto," the three handled their
chores with great dexterity and panache. The interplay between
drums and bass, most evident in "Show Don't Tell" was classic
Rush, and the instrumental virtuosity was as evident in the
three-minute radio hits off this album as it was during the couple
of multi-layered suites the band threw in for good measure, lest
we forget its early days. <p>

Of the new material, "Super Conductor" got the most involved
send-off, complete with varilights that dropped from the overhead
trusses on accordian-like hangers, video images just this side of
surreal, and the use of speakers in the rear of the hall which
created a truly quadrophonic sound. The attention-getter of the
evening, however, was the magical appearance of a pair of giant
rabbits during "War Paint." <p>

Surprisingly, Lee had no trouble being heard, even on tough
numbers like "Marathon" and "Subdivisions," two standout
tunes in a career brimming with equally expressive songs. And,
while it was a nice surprise to find the ultimate Rush classic,
"Tom Sawyer" in the set after all these years, the trio still loses
points for omitting "Spirit of Radio" this time around. <p>

Opening the show was Mr. Big, a better-than-average heavy metal
quartet that derives most of its worth from a convincing display of
instrumental technique, including a bass solo executed as if on a
classical guitar, and a bass/guitar duel that saw the musicians
match each other, note for note, until it passed impressive and
bordered on the self-indulgent. <p>
