This CD sounds like it's from a "made-for-radio" CD (like King Biscuit). The
audience is barely audible except inbetween songs, and then it's overwhelming.
The tracks are definitely from a Roll The Bones show, but it's impossible to
tell which one. The encore IS from "Rush N Roulette '92", but the rest of the
CD is not.<p>

The sound is superb, although the guitar can be hard to hear at times. A 
soundboard copy to be sure, since the audience is never heard except during
the breaks. Speaking of breaks, the songs are completely out of order from the
RTB tour but breaks between most of the songs can't be heard. "Tom Sawyer" is 
faded at the end before "Bravado" begins, and after it ends (before 
"Subdivisions"). There is also a fade just before "Anthem", although why is
anyone's guess because they're already into the encore.<p>

The packaging is pathetic, with a cartoon hand with a cup of dice on the
front, and the same cup tipped over (spilling out dice, a feather, and other
things best left undetermined). A few of the songs are incorrectly labelled
("Early" is misspelled, and "Spirit of the Radio").<p>

What's most frustrating is attempting to find out where this recording came
from. Most of the talking by Geddy is edited out (cleverly I might add).
However, there are two things that can identify it (if you know where it's
from, please let me know). Both appear in "Time Stand Still". About 10 seconds
into the song, there is a person who crows like a rooster. Then you can hear
Neil tapping his sticks together, and hear a count of "four" just before the
song starts.<p>

Overall, a decent CD. Worth it for the sound if you like a mixture of songs
and not a full show. It's a shame the whole show wasn't pressed on to cd,
instead of this menagerie of songs.<p>
