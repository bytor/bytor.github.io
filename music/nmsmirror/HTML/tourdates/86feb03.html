<font size=+1>Band's intellectual music gets lost in the Rush</font><br>
<b>by Mikel Toombs </b><p>

If "it's the thought that counts" had been the motto Monday night at the 
Sports Arena, the Rush concert would have been an overwhelming success. A 
thinking person's heavy metal band -- if that isn't a contradiction in terms -- 
Rush tried to rely on the intricacy of its arrangements and the intellectual 
content of its lyrics to carry a decidedly low-key show.<p>

Unfortunately, the result, while definitely not dumb, was rather numbing. 
Despite all the care Rush put into the music, the group's excessive number of 
shifts and changes -- designed, no doubt, to show off the impressive 
instrumental prowess of the Canadian trio -- left precious little sp
ace for actual songs.<p>

Worse, when Rush did fall into a concise melody, singer Geddy Lee invariably 
had to open his mouth. Lee's instrumental skill (as a bassist and occasional 
keyboardist) may have matched that of guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer 
Neil Peart, but his notorious, seemingly helium-aided vocalizing was 
consistently annoying.<p>

If Rush was truly as intelligent as it so clearly intends, it would have 
followed the lead of Monday night's opening act, the Steve Morse Band. Led 
by guitarist Morse, the ambitious Southern hard-rock group -- which includes 
remnants of the (Dixie) Dregs -- almost completely eschewed vocals in favor 
of a display of musical dexterity equal to or better than Rush's.<p>

Whatever Lee's faults, at least his undistinguished singing made 
indistinguishable many of Rush's more ponderous lyrics. Granted, the group has 
lofty aims -- where most heavy metal bands don't appear to have cracked 
open a book (except perhaps a comic book) in years, Rush has apparently 
digested the collected work of Ayn Rand. Rush is not Rand, though, and its 
otherwise novel approach comes off as more pretentious than illuminating.<p>

On the plus side, Rush has tightened up its approach of late, moving away 
from the science-fiction symphonies that took up much of its earlier albums. 
An extreme example Monday night was "Closer to the Heart," a thunderingly 
simple ballad -- more sweet than suite -- that kept Lee's singing to a minimum 
and was highlighted with some surprisingly coherent interplay between the 
musicians.<p>

More complicated than "Closer," but still reasonably straightforward, were 
such songs as "Red Sector A" and "The Manhattan Project." The latter, 
from the group's current "Power Windows" album, was complemented with partially 
intriguing, rear-projected film footage. The montage began encouragingly with 
humorous '50s-vintage animation, but eventually degenerated into the 
obligatory ominous atomic blasts. The rest of Rush's stage show was even more 
perfunctory. The routine flash pots, laser displays and 
blinding-lights-in-the-fans'-eyes were rationed out in stingy, almost cynical, 
fashion. Especially amusing, albeit unintentionally, was a "fog" effect that 
looked as if it could have been created by a few chain-smokers.<p>

Opening for Rush, the Steve Morse Band proved that it didn't even have to 
attempt such tired gimmicks to receive a rousing response. The four-man 
group's "progressive rock" (to use the '70s term) fusion was put over with 
great intensity and sense of purpose, and its 40-minute set was highlighted 
by fleet-fingered Morse jumping from the majesty of a pipe-organ sound -- 
achieved on the guitar, no less -- to the immediate excitement of searing 
rock licks.<p>
