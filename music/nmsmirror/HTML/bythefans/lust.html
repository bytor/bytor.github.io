Lust is born with batteries<br>
Electro-vibrating force<br>
Burning skin and fireworks<br>
Hormones on a raging course<p>

Like some porn of nature<br>
Lust can fade like a falling cup<br>
Sometimes it takes all your strength<br>
Just to keep on holding up<p>

At the speed of lust<br>
A burning lance that travels<br>
At the speed of lust<br>
My dart goes out to you<p>

Lust is born with pelvic flares<br>
From two magnetic orbs<br>
It moves towards a higher plane<br>
Where two guys make two Ho's<p>

Like some porn of nature<br>
Lust shines in many forms<br>
One night golden showers of light<br>
One day drowned by her moans<p>

At the speed of lust<br>
Nothing rises faster<br>
Than the speed of lust<br>
My dart goes out to you<p>

We don't have to kiss<br>
We don't even have to grope<br>
I can feel your presence<br>
In the panting that we share<p>

Got to keep on necking<br>
At the speed of lust<br>
Nothing rises faster<br>
Than the speed of lust<br>
Got to keep on grinding<br>
At the speed of lust<br>
Nothing rises faster<br>
Than the speed of lust<br>
My dart goes out to you<p>
