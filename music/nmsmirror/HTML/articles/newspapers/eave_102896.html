My experience with Rush is a simple one - I basically liked the
songs I heard on the radio but never made it a point to expand
my musical knowledge of the band. They never instilled that "I
have to buy the CD the day it comes out" attitude, but I wouldn't
change the station when a Rush song came on. But, back when I
was in college, I knew this guy who basically thought that the
trio that is called Rush might as well be the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost. I didn't realize how many people thought the same
thing until I caught Rush's show at The United Center in Chicago. <p>

As the place was filling up I was trying to figure out exactly what
could draw such a devout legion of fans to fill up one of the
larger indoor venues in Chi-Town, especially since they haven't
been out in the public eye in years and their new CD, "Test for
Echo," didn't seem to be getting much attention other than "hey,
there's a new Rush CD out." I guess I would have to wait about
another three hours to figure out what that drawing power is. In
the meantime I saw a show, complete with about a gazilion
lights, more mirrors than, well, a house of mirrors, a giant video
screen, and a stage set-up that included what looked like a
cardboard cut-out of a Baywatch dudette, an old-style
refrigerator, some old-style blender and milk-shake looking
things, and satellite dishes with lasers. Oh yea, there was music too. 

One thing I found out by seeing Rush live is that most of
that radio stuff doesn't do them justice as
musicians and music makers. Sure, the show
had many of those hits I was used to; your
"Subdivisions," "The Big Money," "Free Will,"
and their latest "Test for Echo," but I got to hear
many a many a many a song I have never heard
before. And I slowly started to realize just what
those 18,000ish fans saw in this band. <p>

As I stood and listened and watched I realized
that this Alex Lifeson character is one kick-ass
guitarist. As I stood and listened and watched I
realized that this Neil Peart character plays the
shit out of the drums with the best of them (and
he can spin a drumstick between his fingers
which I always find cool, and he had this
drum-set that spun around so it was actually two
drum sets, and he never missed a beat). As I
stood and listened and watched I realized that
this Geddy Lee character, although looking a little aged, still can direct 
this trio through musical experiences.
And you know, as I stood and listened and watched I realized that this crowd 
knew every word, every beat,
and appreciated every ounce of the show that Rush put on. It was cool. <p>

See, for all of you people like me who only know these
guys from the radio, I will tell you that you are missing
something. And I don't think that even just buying a CD or
two will add to that. The ultimate experience to change your
attitude about Rush is to be there with the worshipers,
follow their lead in the "shoving your fist in the air,"
"pretending to hit that cymbal crash" moment, and realize
that as musicians this band of three can blow away many a
band of, well, many. <p>

The band was great, although it did seem like it took a little
while for them to get into the music as much as the rest of
the crowd, and they had one of the better sound systems I
have seen (I really wish I could have surround sound
speakers like theirs in my living room!). The lighting effects
weren't overbearing, but added just enough, giving a little
kick when it needed but not annoying, and if you like a
good solo, from guitar to drum, this band puts it out there for you. <p>

I can't really say that I am now a member of the Church of
Rush, but I can say I have been enlightened a little. This is a
band that radio can never do justice, I guess mostly because
the really cool songs are too long. You sure as hell won't
hear many stations playing the full blown version of "2112"
that the band played at their show. It's too bad. <p>

The band played for nearly three hours - two sets with a
"Geritol" break of about 20 minutes in the middle. It was
three hours I can honestly say weren't wasted. I only had one problem with the 
show. Hmm, I don't know if it's a problem, it's just my feelings keep changing 
from "who cares?" to "What the hell does he need that for? Who's gonna care if 
he forgets a line, it will just add to this show being more special?" See, 
Geddy Lee was using a "lyric monitor." Basically a little TV that scrolls the 
lyrics to the songs so he doesn't have to worry about forgetting a line. Part 
of me says that it takes away from some of the spontenaity of a live show, but 
the techical part of me knows that it can really screw some things up, 
lighting and laser wise, if a song isn't played right. I guess it's just 
something that will continue to keep me awake at night. I can say this, 
whether the crowd knew it was there or not, they sure didn't seem to care, so, 
I guess I shouldn't care either. <p>

Oh yea, I have to rate the band! Well, I liked the show and the crowd seemed 
to love it, so it's going to be the TWO BIG GIANT THUMBS UP for Rush! <p>

That's it for this one, I'm The Dude on the Right! L8R!!! <p>
