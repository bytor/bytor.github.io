<strong>I: Overture...</strong><p>

(Groovy instrumental -- 2112 Overture)<p>

And the TWITS will screw up the Earth...<p>

<strong>II: Temples of Smeggage</strong><p>

<em>
... the massive laughs of the TWITS rise from the heart of every JPL BBSer.
I have always been enjoyed by them.  To think that every single shread of
JPLness is caused by them ... all is kewl and neat with the TWITS...<p>
</em>

We've screwed just 'bout everything<br>
The par'dies you read<br>
The songs you sing<br>
The stories that give pleasure<br>
to your mind<br>
Read em all and get your gun<br>
Smeg off<br>
All in fun<br>
Never need to know<br>
how or why<p>

we are the TWITS<br>
of the temples of Smeggage<br>
Our smoking modems<br>
Fill the dusty halls<br>
We are the TWITS<br>
Of the temples of smeggage<br>
Our gift to life<br>
Held within your guffaws<p>

Look here at what we've made<br>
Humor is<br>
Our stock in trade<br>
C'mon and read this stuff<br>
oh man<br>
What a nice contended user<br>
Let the sysops<br>
be undone<br>
Get the users proudly<br>
high on spam<p>

we are the TWITS<br>
of the temples of Smeggage<br>
Our smoking modems<br>
Fill the dusty halls<br>
We are the TWITS<br>
of the temples of smeggage<br>
Our gift to life<br>
Held within your guffaws<p>

<strong>III: Discovery</strong><p>

<em>
...behind my computer desk, In that little cubbyhole, I found it.  I brushed
away the spider webs and wondered what it might be.  And then I realized.
It was the number to a CLINK BBS.<p>

...I learned to navigate the myriad of CNet Amiga, and hit my keys to type
out my feelings.  As I found, you could make signature files.  How different
it could be!  I can't wait to tell The Guru Crew!<p></em>

What can this strange board be?<br>
When I call it, files forth be unbound<br>
It's got users that call it, and leave messages<br>
What can this board be which I've found?<p>

See how it's pfiles call apart<br>
And users leave mail in hate<br>
CNet is hard like a mountain<br>
CLINK is easy, with no pain<p>

I can't wait to share this new network<br>
The users will all see it's light<br>
Let them make their own sig files<br>
The sysops raise cain on this night....<p>

<strong>
IV: Presentation
</strong><p>

<em>
... In the silence of chat mode as I finished typing.  I looked at the
monitor to see a grim and expressionless taste.  The Sysops rose to their
feet and threatened to delete my account ... instead of the joy I had
expected, they were words of angry rejection!  I watched in shock and horror
as they deleted my precious mega-big sig....
</em><p>

I know it's very weird<br>
to page you so<br>
But I've found this rad sig file<br>
I thought that you should know<br>
Look at my sig file, and see what it can do<br>
The MCI here spells out "Lame is life"<br>
I know that it will annoy you...<p>

The Guru Crew:<p>

Oh yes we know it's nothing new<br>
It's just a waste of lines<br>
We have no need for lamer ways<br>
Our net is doing fine<br>
Another ploy that helped destroy<br>
That AR Race of man<br>
Forget about your silly whim,<br>
it doesn't fit our plan....<p>

The Users:<p>

I can't believe you're typing<br>
These things just can't be true<br>
Your net could use this beauty<br>
Just think what we might do!<p>

The Guru Crew:<p>

Don't annoy us further<br>
We have maint to do!<br>
Just think about the users<br>
What sigs have they for you?<p>

<strong>
V: Oracle: The Dream
</strong><p>

<em>
... I guess it was a dream, but even now it seemed so vivid to me.  Clearly
yet I see the beckoning of the twits as they stood on the roof of the Inn.<p>

... I see still the incredibly lame humor of their text files, and the spirit
of laughter revealed in the lives and works of this board.  I was overwhelmed
by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way of BBSing
a way that had been driven underground by the CLINK Guru Crew long ago...
I saw now how meaningless BBSing has become with the loss of JPLness...
</em><p>

I blundered on though silent mail<br>
And fell into a fitful sleep<br>
Dreamt  reigns through the night<br>
CLINK ... can't you get less uptight?<p>

I call up a trial lair<br>
H/AI confronts me there<br>
Sysop leads me on ... boards fall away<br>
Through cool users ... JPL ways<p>

I see work of weird people<br>
who grace this strang and wonderous board<br>
I see the hand of humor arise<br>
With twisted mind and open flies<p>

They left AR boards long ago<br>
DigiTWIT still learns and grows<br>
Their power grows with purpose strong<br>
To claim the network ... where they belong<p>

Back to CLINK, AR down<br>
Home of change ....<p>

<strong>
VI: Solioquy
</strong><p>

<em>
... I have not called out for days now, my home is my last refuge in
my total dispair.  I only have the music of Rush to comfort me now.
I can no longer BBS according to the rules of CLINK, but there is no
other Amiga network to go to.  My last hope is that with my HD crash,
I may finally pass into the board of my dream, and know JPLness at last...
</em><p>

The board is still in my directory<br>
The board is still in my head<br>
I heave a sigh and sadly smile<br>
For my term is dead<p>

I wish that it might come to pass<br>
and not fade like all my dreams<br>
Just think of what sigs might be<br>
If CLINK would only be like me!<p>

I don't think I can carry on<br>
This cold and empty sig<br>
Activity is low ... I'm watching Dirty Pair<br>
My hard drive ... crashes over....<p>

<strong>
VII: Grand Finale
</strong><p>

        DigiT.W.I.T. has returned to lead a revolution through humor and
JPLness.  Although their battle is a long and bloody one, it is ultimately
a victorious one...<p>

Attention all Sysops of the CLINK network!<p>

We have assumed control!<p>
