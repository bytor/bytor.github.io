Rush counts many modern rock bands
among its followers, but such hip recognition
hasn't come easy. After making music for over 20
years with hardly a break, the Canadian power trio
decided to take a vacation -- and risk losing touch
with fans.<p>

"In the world of making rock records, three
years really is a long time -- enough to totally
fade from memory," bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee said
recently.<p>

Guitarist Alex Lifeson released his first
solo album under the name Victor, and drummer Neil
Peart worked on a Buddy Rich tribute. Lee spent
time with his family.<p>

Now Rush has returned more inspired than
ever. "Test For Echo," the band's 20th album, is
undoubtedly the hardest-edged record since 1981's
"Moving Pictures," which yielded the hits "Tom
Sawyer" and "Limelight" -- the sound focuses on
Peart's tricky time signatures and Lifeson's busy
solos, with fewer of the keyboards that bound
Rush's recent hardrock/progressive work.<p>

"Although it may not always seem so to the
outsider, what the music is saying and how it's
being put together is always a bit of an
experiment," Lee explained. "This one felt like
the result of numerous experiments, as "Moving
Pictures' and "2112' did -- those albums are
arrival points for me.<p>

"There's no guitar player alive who likes to
play with a keyboard, so usually Alex brings up
his feelings about that. Over the previous three
albums, I had found myself getting a little bored
and frustrated with that overarranging approach
that naturally occurs when you use keyboards at an
early stage of writing. These days I prefer to use
it only to provide something extra that a song
lacks." Three songs from "Test For Echo," produced
by Peter Collins (Jewel, Queensryche), have
ascended Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.
The crisp title track explores the puzzle of
global communication, acoustic guitars pass
through the enchanting "Half The World" and
dizzying licks dart around "Driven."<p>

"Fortunately, technology keeps changing -- the
methods of working on your music get more
confusing and complicated," Lee said. "So that
brings a different challenge every time around.
Those are good things, although sometimes
frustrating, because they stimulate you and take
you away from your normal mode of operation.<p>

"For that same reason, we like to use a
different engineer or producer every couple of
albums. That new look at the same thing is very
important to keep us from falling asleep at the
wheel." Rush started out as a rather pedestrian
heavy metal band, and Lee's singing inspired a
love/hate debate.<p>

"I was brutalized fairly regularly in the
early days in terms of my vocal style," he said
with a laugh. "The one that's stayed with me is
"the damned howling in Hades' -- that's a favorite
quote of mine.<p>

"But it's a blessing to have the opportunity
to make so many records, that you have the ability
to grow up in public." All three members of Rush
have developed some awe-inspiring chops on their
instruments over the years.<p>

"You'll find me in my basement studio,
practicing my stuff over and over again," Lee
said. "This time my wife and I had a little
holiday in Florida before the band started
recording, and I was so paranoid that I took a
little bass with me -- I had to take an hour a day,
sit in a room and make sure I wasn't losing a step.<p>

"When you're a young band first starting, all
you want to do is practice, because gigs are few
and far between. Then you're touring, and you're
practicing every day. So as you are developing as
a musician, you live for practice -- that's
creating who you want to be.<p>

"Then when you achieve a measure of success
and you're able to slow down, your practice
subsides a bit. And you suddenly find yourself in
the unfortunate position of feeling a little
detached from your muse. When that happens, you
feel the urge to start woodshedding again.
"What we learned from this album was, all the
extra practice we did was actually able to take us
to a higher level. Every time you think you've
flattened out in your learning curve, you find out
that that's not true -- there's so much farther to
go. Like any craft, you have to work on it your
entire life to keep on getting better and better."
Rush is touring in support of "Test For Echo,"
hitting Fiddler's Green Amphitheater on Thursday
night.<p>

"We've pulled out all the stops -- we're a
band that still believes in big production," Lee
said. "It's probably the most theatrical tour
we've ever done. It seems as we get a little
older, we embrace that side of what our songs say."<p>
