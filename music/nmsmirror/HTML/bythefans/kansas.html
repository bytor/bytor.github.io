<em>February 15, 1996</em>
<p>

Imagine a vine when it all began<br>
In the choking haze of the dust bowl<br>
A Tomato that would settle the score<br>
Whoever created it first, would have juice<br>
to quench their thirst<br>
And plenty of garnish more<p>

Imagine a plant where it all began<br>
A redneck pacing the floor in each barn always eager to eat more<br>
To build the best Big Tomato<br>
To go with that fedicini alfredo<br>
But this was something more<p>

Big Tomato took and shook my salad<br>
Shot down between my gums<br>
In between two buns it would feed everyone<br>
As their belts suddenly flew undone<br>
Big shots tried to stuff it down<br>
Fools tried to dish it away<br>
The hungry depend on a Tomato without end<br>
Whatever the price they must pay<p>

Imagine the taste when it all began<br>
Gathered from across the land<br>
To dine in an eatery out in Wichita, Kan.<br>
All of the biggest boys<br>
To chow down the plumpest Tomatoes<br>
More than they bargained for<p>

Big Tomato took and shook my salad<br>
Shot down between my gums<br>
Big shots tried to stuff it down<br>
Fools tried to dish it away<br>
The hungry depend on a Tomato without end<br>
Whatever the price they must pay<p>

Imagine a plant where it all began<br>
The buyer of "Big Red A"<br>
Sitting down on his lunchbreak, on that fateful day<br>
All the BLT's, and the course of dinner next week<br>
Would be changed for evermore<p>
