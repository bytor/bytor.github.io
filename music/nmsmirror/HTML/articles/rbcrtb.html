<em>From the desk of Neil Peart...</em></strong><p>

Hello again, everybody --<p>

 Here I am again with the latest news.  We have just finished a new album,
called <strong>Roll The Bones</strong>, which should be released in September.  It contains
ten new songs, including a long-awaited new instrumental called "Where's My
Thing?"  We are also presently planning a tour, which should commence in
October sometime.<p>

 We are all really excited about the band at the moment, accelerating our
plans for the tour even at the expense of our <strong>holidays</strong>.  The 
recording went
so smoothly and we had such a good time making <strong>Roll The 
Bones</strong>, and we are
so pleased with the results of our work together that, for once in our lives,
we're actually thinking that our future might be longer than <strong>next 
year!</strong><p>

 Not that it's getting any <strong>easier</strong>, you understand; I think 
it's just that
we're getting better...  Anyway, the important thing is that we continue to
be very happy working together, and can see it as a satisfying partnership
for the foreseeable future.  So maybe that will hold off the inevitable
rumors about us breaking up-for at least another year.<p>

 And, without further ado, here we go with another session of Q & A --<p>

<strong>
I read somewhere that there was some sort of educational program on poetry
which contained a lot of Neil's lyrics and was being used in some schools.
Can you give me more details about this?

<dl>
<dd>
Right class-come to attention now; the lesson will begin.<br>
But no -- I think a few teachers have tried to reach their students by using
song lyrics, ours among them, to illustrate things in their curricula, but as
far as I know these are just individual efforts, and not part of an organized
"program."
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
What are the words to the song "Didacts and Narpets"?  I have listened
closely but the majority of the words are still a mystery.
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Lisa Gabriel,<br>
Brecksville, OH<br>
(and also Carl Puglisi Berlin CT, and Travis Williams, Naperville IL)
</font><p>

<dl>
<dd>
Okay, I <strong>may</strong> have answered this before, but if not, the 
shouted words in
that song represent an argument between Our Hero and the Didacts and
Narpets -- teachers and parents.  I honestly can't remember what the actual
words were, but they took up opposite positions like:  "Work!  
<strong>Live!</strong>  Earn! <strong>Give!</strong>" and like that.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
On your bass drums you have "Scissors, Paper, Rock."  Why was this not used
to promote the tour?  Do you see "Scissors, Paper, Rock" as yourselves?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Margo Lozoya,<br>
Cotton, CA</font><p>

<dl>
<dd>
The images from my bass drums came from the cover artwork of 
<strong>Presto</strong>, where
it was a kind of "secondary" image appearing on the inside of the package, as
we have often done before, like with the egg and clamp for <strong>Grace Under
Pressure</strong>, or -- here's a hint for the analytical -- with the 
<strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> cover, where we confused everything by putting 
the secondary image <strong>first</strong>,
so that the red spheres reflect the fireballs which appear in the main image,
which appears inside.  I know it's confusing, but we thought it 
<strong>looked</strong> nice.<p>

 Of course, the scissors, paper, stone metaphor comes from the song "Hand
Over Fist," but we thought it made a nice picture as well, and wanted to use
it somewhere, plus I thought it would be a nice device for the drum heads.<p>

 As to whether these three symbols represent <strong>us</strong> -- I'll 
never tell...
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
1/  Why isn't "he" at home in the song "Anagram"?
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
I agree that "he" <strong>could</strong> be at home -- I guess he had to 
go out...
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
2/  During the last couple of years, artists like Peter Gabriel, Paul Simon,
Sting, and Patrick O'Hearn have explored indigenous music from the other
worlds.  Also your music traces influences from these cultural worlds.  Can
you tell me why their music is so interesting and how it can fit into the
music of Rush?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Alex Van Loon,<br>
Holland</font><br>

<dl><dd>
2/ Hello again Alex -- welcome back to our show!  For me, one great thing about
Rush is that there are no barriers -- any style of music is an "acceptable"
influence, providing it's interesting, and certainly we have drawn from a lot
of them.  Personally, I am very interested in learning about different
rhythms and trying to apply them to my drumming so that when I learn about
Nigerian music, for example, it turns up as an influence in songs like
"Territories" and "Scars."  Sometimes the influences are even more subtle,
like the instrumental section of "Superconductor" where I use a West African
pop beat, or other times where I just use <strong>variations</strong> of a 
Caribbean or
African rhythm.  Or in "Tai Shan," where I built the drum patterns around the
wood-block rhythm that the Buddhist monks use for their chants.  Subtle, but
a nice touch of authenticity, I think.  Unlike some other artists, I am not
interested in <strong>emulating</strong> the music of other cultures -- I like 
rock! -- but I do like to <strong>learn</strong> from other styles of music, 
and apply the resulting ideas in my own way.

<strong>
What made you decide to switch from Simmons electronic pads to d-drum pads.

In a word:  reliability...
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
1/  At the St. Louis show, Rush began their encore with "The Big Money," and
didn't play "The Spirit of Radio," but at the June concerts, they played
"The Spirit of Radio" to start the encore, and didn't play "The Big Money."
 Why?
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
Early in the <strong>Presto</strong> tour we found that "Radio" was feeling 
a bit stale, so
we put it aside for awhile.  Then later we brought it back to alternate with
"Big Mahoney," and eventually stayed with "Radio" as the better
encore-opener.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
2/  In my high school junior-year English class, our teacher played "Xanadu"
for the class during our unit on Samuel Taylor Coleridge.  She interpreted
the instrumental lead-in as a sort of parallel to the violent imagery at the
beginning of Coleridge's "Kubla Khan," from which "Xanadu" draws.  Is there
any truth to this?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Dean Mentges,<br>
University of Illinois</font><p>

<dl><dd>
2/  Sure, why not?
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
1/  Did Alex play a keyboard at the San Antonio show of the <em>Presto</em> tour
(and if so what instrument was it?)
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
Alex played a lot of "foot" keyboards throughout the show, but I think there
was only one part he played with his fingers -- the lead line in the bridges of
"Time Stand Still."
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
2/  My other question relates to the song "Force Ten."  You told Charles
Henault this title referred to the Beaufort Wind Scale, but Bill Banascewicz
quotes Geddy as saying it referred to the "tenth" song that was "forced" onto
<em>Hold Your Fire</em>.  Which is correct?  (Or is there truth in both?)
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Greg Seal<br>
San Antonio, TX</font><p>

<dl><dd>
2/ My quote is correct in the <strong>literal</strong> sense, though Geddy's 
is certainly true figuratively.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
What is the real reason you switched from Tama (which is what I play and only
because you played them) to Ludwig?  If you could be specific because I read
the <em>Modern Drummer</em> article and didn't see the reason for the switch.
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Kevin Brown<br>
Hurst TX</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Well gee, Kevin, if you're thinking of the same <strong>Modern 
Drummer</strong> article I
am, in which I wrote about the choice, I thought it was pretty clear that I
switched because I found, in a side-by-side test, that the Ludwigs 
<strong>sounded</strong>
better.  (What other reason-money?  Drum companies don't have enough to buy
me!)  After the test, Tama assured me they could make a set which sounded
"just like the Ludwigs," but that seemed kind of pointless!
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
1/  I recently got hold of <em>Grace Under Pressure</em>.  I noticed that "The 
Enemy
Within" was Part I of "Fear."  I had already acquired "The Weapon" and "Witch
Hunt," Parts II and III.  Is this all of "Fear" or are there other parts that
either haven't been released or are on other albums?
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
Those are the only three parts of "Fear."
</dd></dl><P>

<strong>
2/  <em>2112</em> (the song) sounds like it could be much longer.  Was it 
cut down for the album; are there other parts and will they ever be released?
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
The album version of <em>2112</em> is how it was designed to be; there are no 
other parts.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
3/  I recently got a copy of <em>Visions</em> and read that "Oracle" from 
<em>2112</em> has
never been played live.  This surprised me and I was wondering if there was
any specific reason for this.
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
It is true that "Oracle" was never performed live, though the reason is quite
prosaic.  Way back in 1976, when that album was released, we were still
opening most shows, and our set was usually about forty minutes long.  Thus,
even from the beginning we played an abbreviated version, even leaving out
"Discovery" as well I think, and then later we tended just to play "Overture"
and "The Temples of Syrinx," to allow time for other songs.
</dd></dl><P>

<strong>
4/  Who (what?) is Mongo?  I would also be grateful for any tips on
interpreting the lyrics as well, since their meaning has also eluded me.
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Travis Williams<br>
Naperville IL</font><p>

<dl><dd>
4/  Mongo is a character in <strong>Blazing Saddles</strong>, and in one 
scene Sheriff Bart
delivers a bomb to him, with the line "Candygram for Mongo!"  Thus, 
<strong>Anagram</strong>
for Mongo seemed natural.  As for "meaning," that is really the wrong word --
it is, after all, a word game-think more of impressions, images, and an internal
logic to each line, or each verse.  What I was after in that, as in other
songs like "Presto" and "Hand Over Fist," is more of a sense of "resonance":
so that the listener might <strong>feel</strong> something, rather than 
<strong>think</strong> it.  With
some people it works; with others, it doesn't.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
1/  Who transcribes the music for each album for the published song books?
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
I don't know really; someone the publishing company hires.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
2/  Does the band actually write out parts (in standard notation) in the
studio, or do they simply work from tapes and memory?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Andrew Piercy<br>
Manchester UK</font><p>

<dl><dd>
From tapes and memory.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
During the course of a tour do you change the show, or do you play basically
the same set each concert?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Dan Wipperman<br>
Urbandale IA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Strange name for a city that, Urbandale I mean -- sort of means "city-valley"
doesn't it?  Anyway, we do tend to settle on a selection of songs that we
like and stay with it for the duration of a tour, with the exception of
things like the above-named tradeoff between "The Big Money" and "The Spirit
of Radio," or when we find a song has grown stale for us and we have to give
it a rest for awhile.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
On my <em>Hold Your Fire</em> cassette, towards the end of "Tai Shan" I hear a
female singing (Aimee Mann?)  What is she singing?  It is very hard to hear.
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
C. Mark Kaefer<br>
Basking Ridge NJ</font><p>

<dl><dd>
It is indeed Aimee Mann in there, only she's not exactly "singing"
anything-we took her voice from one of the other songs and played it
backwards, just as a nice texture which gave an eerie, pseudo-Chinese sound.<p>
 And no, this is not backward-masking, or whatever those lunatic call
it -- there is <strong>nothing</strong> about the devil in there!
</dd></dl>

<strong>
At the end of "Distant Early Warning" Mr. Lee sings "Absalom, Absalom."  I am
wondering if this is in reference to King David's son in the Bible, or the
book by William Faulkner, or maybe another source that I am not aware of, but
I am interested.
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Steve Varnal<br>
Peachtree City GA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Directly, the reference comes from the Faulkner book.  After reading the
novel, I was curious (like you) and looked up the name in the encyclopedia.<p>

 Then, while writing that song, I had "obsolete, absolute" in there, and I
thought how similar the word-shape was to "Absalom."  Since one of the main
themes of the song was compassion, it occurred to me that the Biblical story
was applicable-David's lament for his son:  "Would God I had died for thee,"
seemed to be the ultimate expression of compassion.  And that's how it
happened.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
1/  Whose voice is on "The Camera Eye" that says "Let us through"?  (I know
it's trivial.)
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
Trivial maybe, but at least it's <strong>fun!</strong>  We were looking for 
an urban sound
effect, and we ended up using a part of <strong>Superman</strong>, when Clark 
Kent is
arriving at the offices of the <strong>Daily Planet</strong> amid the traffic 
and bustle of Metropolis.  No deeper meaning, I promise you.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
2/  John Steinbeck in 1959 said he had "not felt the country for 20 years."
 He had been observing the changes "only from books and newspapers."  Do you
think touring has helped you <em>feel</em> the country, or people, or places?  
If so, has this helped you become a better writer?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Jay Roberts<br>
Pope AFB, NC</font><p>

<dl><dd>
2/ I think touring <strong>can</strong> be a very broadening experience, 
though not if it's
done in the usual rock band way.  Airports, hotels, and arenas do not tell
you much about a place; you have to make the effort to get out and see a city
and the country around it, and try to meet people just as 
<strong>people</strong>, as a
stranger.  That takes some effort, but I think it's worth it -- since I started
getting out on my bicycle I have acquired a whole new affection for America.<p>

 And yes I think it's especially important for a writer; that is one reason I
am always so concerned about my privacy, and avoiding the pointless
constrictions of fame.  The only way to learn things is to be an
<strong>observer</strong> -- not the <strong>observed!</strong>
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
1/  Is the front cover of <em>Signals</em> a joke-to-be?
</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
Hmm.  Not <strong>exactly</strong> sure what you mean by this.  Certainly it 
was meant to be
a humorous pun for <strong>other</strong> types of signals, but then it would 
be a joke-that-was rather than a joke-to-be, no?
</dd></dl>

<strong>
2/  Are the "he" and "she" in "Superconductor" generic or are they real
personalities?  Mikhail Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher as a guess.
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Andrew Leight<br>
Petawawa Ont.</font><p>

<dl><dd>
2/ Nobody was specifically represented there, although I certainly had more
"conventional" entertainment figures in mind, as opposed to politicians!
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
During the <em>Presto</em> tour I saw you perform three times and I was even 
more impressed with "Scars" after having seen you play it live.  I noticed that
you had a pedal designed to trigger the snare during certain parts of the
song to keep your arms free.  Could you explain what the device was that
accomplished this and how the pedal was set up?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Brent Elliott<br>
Lincoln NE</font><p>

<dl><dd>
It's just a regular foot pedal really, made by a company called "Shark" which
may or may not still be in business.  Like a drum pad, it simply triggered a
midi impulse into the Akai sampler, which then reproduced a sample of my
snare (taken from "Grand Designs," as it happens, as are the tom samples used
in the live version of "Closer to the Heart" last tour).
</dd></dl><p>

Whew!  A <strong>big</strong> batch of questions this time.  
<strong>Now</strong> can I go and have some
fun? Thanks...
