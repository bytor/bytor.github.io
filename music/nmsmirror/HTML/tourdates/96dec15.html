Rush delivers the goods in 3-hour show</font><br>
<strong>by Jay Lustig</strong><p>

        After more than 20 years of touring, Rush has figured out what its
fans want; Rush music, and plenty of it.<p>
        Touring for the first time without an opening act, the Canadian
progressive-rock tri played for slightly more than three hours at the
Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford Sunday night, pausing only
for a 15-minute intermission.<p>
        "One of the benefits of doing a long show is you get to do all
kinds of songs," frontman Geddy Lee said in the middle of a concert that
featured songs from the band's new album "Test For Echo" and unavoidable
hits like "Tom Sawyer" and "Closer To The Heart," but also pleased
die-hards with less obvious choices like the 10-minute "Natural Science,"
from 1980's "Permanent Waves" album, and even the longer "2112" suite from
the 1976 concept album of the same name.<p>
        The band's lyrics, dominated by science fiction fantasies and
impenetrable commentary on the dangers of technology, greed, and fascism,
became tiresome quickly.  But singer-bassist-keyboardist Lee, guitarist
Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart proved that they are not only among
the most technically accomplished musicians in rock, but that they're
still energetic, enthusiastic showmen, intent on cramming as many
imaginative riffs as possible into their busy, winding songs.<p>
        Peart in particular was a marvel, routinely generating dense,
superhumanly complex patterns rather than just keeping the beat.  Even
when Lifeson was soloing, Peart was riveting: strangely enough, audience
"air drummers" outnumbered "air guitarists" during these segments.<p>
        Peart, whose grim presence contrasted with the mpore fan-friendly
preening of Lifeson and Lee, was the only band member to take an extended
solo, pounding away for 10 minutes as video images of different dancers
flashed above him.  Like Pink Floyd, and U2 on its controversial "Zoo"
tour, Rush is too eager to "enhance" songs with videos that range from
psychedelic (but cheesy) to solemnly meaningful (but heavy-handed).  In
"Nobody's Hero," footage of "heroes" like Willie Mays and Charles
Lindbergh were unnecessary distractions, and the flashing of lyrics during
"Animate" proved that when it comes to rock'n'roll, wordsare meant to be
heard, not read.  Even though some of  the words were unclear, Lee's
plaintive vocals perfectly expressed the "struggle for control" he was
inging about.<p>
        Wisely, Lee rarely sang in the piercing, high-pitched tone he is
most famous for, but adopted a more relaxed, and soulful style that made
Rush's cerebral music  seem more warm and inviting.  He became shrill only
on a few oldies that wouldn't sound right any other way.<p>
        None of Rush's '90s songs sounded like throwaways, but they
weren't all encouraging, either.  The "Test For Echo" title track was yet
another mystifying message song, and it was a bonehead move to have a
video skeleton recreate the leaden studio rap of "Roll The Bones," the
title track from the band's 1991 album.  More successful newer songs
included the oddly lurching "Driven," seemingly influenced by King
Crimson's quirky sense of rhythm, and the elegant instrumental "Limbo."
which sounded far more taut and purposeful than it did on "Test For Echo."<p>
        When they stayed focused on their stunning virtuosic music rather
than their thin lyrical concepts, Rush ruled.<p>

Rush Updates Its Sense of Alienation
</font><br>
<strong>By BEN RATLIFF</strong><p>

Back in the '70s, there were a number of bands like
Rush. The group's lyrics convey a fascination and a loathing for
technology. It uses huge symbolic totems to transmit the thematic
meaning of each album. It speaks for the alienated, yet flirts with
the alienation effect in its music. They are
post-modernity-watchers: They once even thanked NASA on an album
sleeve for letting them attend the launching of a space shuttle.<p>

But now Rush is a specialty act, and the preponderance of fans
over 30 filling the seats of the Continental Arena on Monday night
confirmed that the band has settled comfortably into 1981-model
amber. The Canadian trio is touring behind its 21st album, "Test
for Echo" (Atlantic), frying North American arenas with
electronically assisted high frequencies, exact odd-meter passages
and the glottal wail of the band's bassist and singer, Geddy Lee.<p>

As before, generalized frustration with society is still an
important theme in the group's lyrics. But the new songs,
addressing such topics as televised murder trials and
cyber-communication, have shifted the locus of alienation from a
high-school mind to that of a middle-aged libertarian searching for
meaning in an unhealthy, dangerous world.<p>

Fast-cutting video backdrops like a hundred flipped television
channels illustrated the songs, a good old device for conveying a
world gone mad. Rush has hundreds of images in its paranoia bank,
but the ones that kept popping up were Richard Nixon, J.F.K.,
Jacqueline Onassis and fashion-magazine models. (One of the most
charming aspects of the band's Ayn Randian mindset is that they're
still shocked by advertising.)<p>

The concert mixed new material with back catalogue hits
including "Subdivisions" and "Tom Sawyer"; a long stretch from
their album-length suite "2112" brought the crowd to standing
ecstasy. Still, the presentation was so hard and shiny that it was
nearly impossible to discern whether the players were having a good
or bad night. Rush used to have more of an improvisational
esthetic, but Alex Lifeson's guitar solos were few and quite short;
the music is built on chords and changing time signatures, with the
occasional gentle strumming in a highly arranged introduction or
coda.<p>

The exception and the climax was Neil Peart's drum solo, a
10-minute polyrhythmic bonanza performed on two different drum sets
accessed by means of a revolving platform. With cowbells,
synthesized pads, cymbals of every description, Peart's drum set
was a small nation-state unto itself. It was a dream of a drum set,
a thing of comically vast proportions -- like the band's idea of a
protest song.<p>
