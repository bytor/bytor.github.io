<p>

If we burn our wings<br>
Trying to cook 'em well-done<br>
From the heat of the charcoal<br>
Forgotten in all of the fun<br>
If the dinner's done --<br>
Though everything is lost<br>
We will order out,<br>
But we will not count the cost<p>

When the smoke has cleared<br>
And edible food denied<br>
A burger too blackened<br>
Chicken a little too fried<br>
If we keep our pride<br>
Though all the food is lost<br>
We will order out,<br>
But we will not count the cost<p>

And if the fire stops<br>
There's only the smell of the flame<br>
All the steaks and drumsticks,<br>
All the barbeque in vain<br>
And if the guests remain<br>
Though everything is lost<br>
We will order out,<br>
But we will not count the cost<p>
