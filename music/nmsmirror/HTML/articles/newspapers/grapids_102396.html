<font size=+1>Rejuvenated Rush hits Grand Rapids on the upswing</font><br>
<b>by John D. Gonzalez</b><p>

"I'm the new guy," says Neil Peart, laughing at the fact that he
wasn't the original drummer of the rock group Rush.<p>

But Peart is who most rock historians and fans recognize as the one
who pushed Rush from its original blue collar rock into more art rock
realms, making the Canadian trio a force on FM radio in the late 1970s and
early '80s.<p>

Peart joined the band in July 1974 after original drummer John Rutesy
quit shortly after Mercury Records re-released the band's self-produced
debut.<p>

"It's really not an interesting story," says Peart of auditioning in
front of singer'bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson.  "They were
looking for somebody, I tried out and we got along well, and that was it.
Before that I was playing in the local bands (in Toronto) and working in
the farm equipment business."<p>

Peart and the guys haven't toiled in the toiled in the club scene
since.  Today the band still tours and records more than 20 years after
creating a buzz on American soils in the late '70s with concept albums
like "A Farewell to Kings" and "Hemispheres."<p>

But the latter albums -- 1980's "Permanent Waves," 1981's "Moving
Pictures" and 1982's "Signals" -- were what made Rush an international
smash.<p>

The shorter songs on "Permanent Waves," brought more radio airplay,
and sold-out shows, including five nights at London's Hammersmith Odeon.
Then in 1981, "Moving Pictures" songs "Tom Sawyer" and the instrumental
"YYZ" further established the band, "Tom Sawyer" climbing on the pop
charts to No. 44 in June of 1981.<p>

The U.S. success was sweet, but so were the sold-out gigs in London,
where Peart had once visited before his Rush days.<p>

Inspired by music of The Who and other British bands, Peart set out
to experience Europe right after completing high school.  He stayed there
for about 18 months.<p>

"I was searching for fame and fortune," Peart says.  "It wasn't
there."<p>

But it was an invaluable experience where he learned about music, and
about life.  "I basically just copied a list of record companies and
managers and booking agents off the back of record album," Peart says
"It was one of those things where experienc was worth more than success
at that time.  I got to play in some bands, have a real job and make a
living, things that are life affirming."  Rush kept up with the times and
released other albums in the '80s.  Some did better than others.  The '90s
included "Chronicles", a 1991 collection of essentials from the band's
career.<p>

But not until the current  "Test for Echo" did the members begin to
feel invigorated again.  One review said it was a "welcomed return by an
irrepressible and influential band."<p>

"Nothing wrong with it," he says of the review.  "But I got some
great advice from American writer Tom Robbins once.  I had just read his
novel ('Shinny Legs And All') and then read a scathing review of it in the
New York Times; it really made me mad.<p>

"So I wrote to him and asked if he had been bothered by that review,
and not to consider that it reflected his readers, and he wrote back
saying that he never read his reviews because if he believed the good ones
he would have to belive the bad ones, too.  Since that time I'm careful
not to read the reviews."<p>

Still, band members were excited about "Echo."  The trio had been
doing its own thing after release of '93's "Counterparts."  Geddy Lee
stayed home as he and his wife had a baby girl.  Alex Lifeson worked on a
solo record.  Peart produced a big-band tribute to Buddy Rich, for which
he received the Buddy Rich Lifetime Achievement award.<p>

It made "Echo" more satisfying for them to work together again.<p>

"And also because it was such a departure; we took quite a long break
from the band," Peart says.  "The Buddy Rich tribute led me into a field
of study with a teacher that led me to practicing every day down in the
basement and completely re-inventing my approach to the drum set in a
profound way after 30 odd years.<p>

"To see it bear fruit on this record, and to feel the results  I had
been after...I feel fortunate to find the right teacher (70-year-old jazz
player Fred Gruber), who led me to the paths of righteousness."<p>

First arena-rock show was quite the Rush
</font><P>
<strong>by John Gonzalez</strong><p>

     The Van Andel Arena rocked -- I mean really rocked -- for the first time
as 7,981 fans lift the downtown arena Wednesday night screaming for more
Rush.  Literally.<p>
     Hordes of fans leaving the show cheered loudly, many joyous over
witnessing one of the finest rock shows to hit West Michigan in years.<p>
     No offense to the Neil Diamond fans who danced and sang the night
away recently at the arena's first major concert.  But Rush fans partied
hardier.  And they proved it throughout the 2 1/2 hour, two-set
performance.<p>
     Even though the show started a bit slowly because of some tweaking of
the sound system, fans rose to their feet immediately.  On the main floor
they remained up all night.<p>
     When it was all over, fans were treated to 26 songs, many of which
have never been played live before because of time limitations on previous
tours.<p>
     Fans voiced their approval when the first set closed with both
movements from "2112," the title cut from the group's 1976 breakthrough
album.<p>
     The audience probably liked it even more when the band played
"Natural Science" (from "Moving Pictures"), another song that wasn't
played much on past tours because of its nearly 10-minute length.<p>
     But the Canadian power trio also included some of the songs that made
it commercially successful, too.<p>
     Geddy Lee, the band's lead vocalist, bassist and keyboardist, sounded
classic on just about any tune, especially on the time-tested hits such as
"Subdivisions," "Freewill" and "Tom Sawyer," all from albums released in
the early '80s.<p>
     Guitarist Alex Lifeson was a surprising life of the party.  Not only
were his solos full of vitality, but his enthusiasm on stage made him a
pleasure to watch.  And he was funny, too.  He introduced himself on stage
as Tommy Lee and then kissed a cardboard cut out of Lee's wife, Pamela
Anderson, which was resting on a stack of amps.<p>
     But the night's shining star was drummer Neil Peart, who was alone
worth the price of admission.  Though he was feeling a bit sick, and
retreated immediately after the concert to his hotel room, Peart never
gave less than 110 percent.<p>
     He was precision-like on some tunes ("Animate," "Dreamline") yet
broad and biting on others ("Subdivision," "The Spirit of Radio").<p>
     He stole the show during the second set while playing a drum solo; a
solo fans will be talking about for years for its revolving set and
building-to-a-crescendo flurry.  Even Mick Fleetwood would have a tough
time following this act.<p>
     Peart truly plays his percussion with heart.<p>
     Performing on a decent stage (carpeted even) Rush kept its
presentation entertaining yet never extreme.  Its technology theme was
never overdone, only using the arena laser beams and video screens to
augment the music.  It would have been easy for Lee to turn a Bono (of U2)
and do something goofy like order pizzas from stage for everyone.  (Bono
did that at The Palace on the Zoo TV Tour.)<p>
     Video effects on "Roll the Bones," where a rapping skull gets a few
laughs, and "Driven," which features footage of classic cars, make it all
entertaining and not at all overbearing.<p>
     As for the sound system, Rush sounded superb, clear and crisp,
especially if you were seated on either side of the main floor.  The upper
level was not as strong, but still impressive.<p>
     On a mid-show stroll of the venue listening for sound quality,
however, the system failed miserably at the back of the arena and even on
the main floor.  For whatever reason, the mix was muddy and not as clear
as in other spots.  I took in the first five songs of the show from the
back of the room and decided to move on because it was so bad.<p>
     I also noticed that fans were very interested in a pair of
surround-sound speakers placed at the back of the arena to achieve certain
audio effects.  The band used them during songs such as "Subdivisions" (to
accent the chorus) and "Limbo," an instrumental from Rush's latest studio
album, "Test For Echo," (to play some rain).<p>
     The concert also brought a night of firsts to the Van Andel Arena:
First fist fight among patrons who had too much to drink; first bonafide
sea of Bics (brighter than Neil Diamond's); and first whiff of substances
that would make the Black Crowes proud.<p>
