<strong>
February 10 1990<br>
Toronto</strong><p>

 Well, here we are, just days away form the first show on the 
<strong>Presto</strong> tour.<p>

 We've been rehearsing for weeks now, relearning the old and new songs, and
it's coming along.  As usual in a Rush show, we'll be playing a handful of
songs from the newest album, and a good variety of older stuff -- some
'standards' (seems funny to think of them that way), as well as some
unexpected appearances.  When we began putting together the show, things went
slowly at first, learning one song at a time, but now we are able to play the
whole show in one go, so we know we're going to be all right.  That old
show-biz maxim:  "All right on the night."<p>

 As always, there was a lot of work involved in preparing for a new tour, but
especially this one; we were determined not to make it a continuation of
previous tours, but a whole new thing:  the first Rush tour of the '90s.  So
we had a lot to think about, in the music and presentation of the show, but
those around us have been working even harder, booking the tour, hotel and
travel arrangements, organizing technical requirements with the arenas, and --
a job which becomes increasingly more complex and critical -- preparing our
equipment.<p>

 We have been lucky as a band to have spanned the time period we have.  I
don't mean just our <strong>longevity</strong>, but also this particular era.  Rock music
has grown so much stylistically, allowing us a steady flow of new influences,
and the technological changes have been perfectly timed for Rush's
development, from the first monophonic synthesizers to the current summit of
MIDI and digital sampling.  Every time we have asked ourselves if we
shouldn't break down and add a fourth member, technology has offered us an
alternative.<p>

 This tour was no exception.  Early on we talked of adding a keyboard player
or a backup singer (or a keyboard player who could sing backup).  We were
open-minded about the idea, and gave it serious thought, but the idea never
<strong>felt</strong> right.  We like being a trio, we like each other as individuals and a
working unit, and we didn't want to mess with that chemistry by adding
another person, even informally.<p>

 So once again we're trying to do it all.  Trying to cover all those frets,
keys, foot pedals, voices, drumheads, cymbals, and triggers at their proper
times is no cakewalk, and when I sit behind my drums during rehearsal and
watch Geddy and Alex choreograph their moves to cover everything, I have to
think again:  "Wouldn't it be easier to get another guy?"<p>

 But no.  Like little boys in the sandbox, we still want to have all the toys
for ourselves.  Or at least make all the <strong>noise</strong> ourselves.<p>

 And that's where we draw the line.  We figure that as long as we do the
actual triggering ourselves, then we're <strong>playing</strong> it.  Like in "Scars," where
the drum part includes eight different exotic drums -- I'm still playing them,
and it's still really difficult to do.  (Somehow in the Puritan work ethic,
that makes it okay)  It's <strong>not</strong> just like pushing a button.  And though a
sound may be, in a sense, <strong>recorded</strong> by digital sampling, it's not like a
tape that just rolls along; we have to hit the key or foot pedal at the
<strong>right</strong> moment, like any note of music, and musically, we also have to frame
it properly.<p>

 So yes, to answer the question nobody asked, there are sampled instruments
and voices up there, but rest assured -- we're <strong>playing</strong> them.  The choices
were difficult:<p>

 Do we hire another musician to augment our live sound?<p>

 Hmmm...No.<p>

 Do we just play the songs in a stripped-down analog-only version?<p>

 Hmmm...No.<p>

 Do we use tapes?<p>

 <strong>No.</strong><p>

 Well, with digital sampling we can have all the sounds we want, whenever we
want them, and we can trigger them ourselves.<p>

 Okay, yeah.  We'll take that one.<p>
<hr><p>

 Anyway, that's what was on my mind today.  And now it's gone and there's
nothing on my mind.  So let's go on to some questions from you...<p>

<strong>What is Geddy saying on "La Villa Strangiato" on <em>Exit Stage 
Left?</em></strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Fred Laise<br>
Gloucester VA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
The translation was given in the credits...I guess you didn't 
<strong>buy</strong> it then,
huh?  Something about "baby needs new shoes."  The real question that
everyone, including Doug Trompak of Bull Shoals AR, is burning to know is:<p>

<strong>
 What was Alex singing in that song during the video for 
<em>A Show Of Hands?</em></strong><p>

 Well, sorry to let you all down, but I'm afraid it's a non-story -- he wasn't
censored or anything like that.  His vocalizing was impromptu and unexpected,
and his microphone wasn't turned on!  Yep, as simple and dull as that.  As
for what he was saying, it was something like this:  "La la la la la la."

<strong>
What does the title "Force Ten" refer to?

<strong>
What is the Omega Concern found in <em>Power Windows</em> and 
<em>Hold Your Fire?</em>
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Brad Cokendolpher<br>
Boone's Mill VA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
The Omega Concern is Alex's non-profit organization for Musical Scientists,
devoted to the discovery of wonderful inventions.  The Omega Stand, on which
he plays his acoustic guitar, is one such, another is the stand which holds
my rhyming dictionary when I'm lyric-writing, or the backlit lyric stand
which Geddy uses in the studio to hold those lyrics.  And, of course, not to
forget the wonderful Album-Order-Deciding-Device.

<strong>
How was it decided that "Mystic Rhythms" would be the theme song to the show
"1986," and how did the band feel about it?
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Trey Daughtry<br>
Richmond VA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
I don't know how they came to hear the song, but the show approached us and
asked if they could use it.  Of course, they didn't <strong>pay</strong> us 
anything, but
they said they'd give us a credit.  How did we feel about it?  We thought it
was nice.

<strong>
What is the meaning of the term "Gub."

<strong>
Will Rush ever consider playing in Israel?  You have a lot of fans here.
</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Yossi Leibovitz<br>
Rishon Lezion, Israel</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Gee, maybe we've got a lot of fans in <strong>your</strong> house, but not in 
the rest of
the country.  Not to be crass about it, but just by way of illustration, I
think our last royalty statement showed about six people who had bought our
records there.  Maybe <strong>thousands</strong> of pirated copies are sold in Israel that
we don't know about?  But seriously, sure we'd consider playing there, if
enough people wanted to see us.

<strong>
Is the writer you describe in "Losing It" Ernest Hemingway?  Is is more than
a coincidence that <em>Grace Under Pressure</em> is a well-known Hemingway
definition for courage?  Is the dancer you describe any particular
individual?
</strong><p>
<font size=-1>
Laura Harriman<br>
St. Louis MO</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Yes, the writer is old Ernest.  I <strong>believe</strong> that the 
expression "grace under
pressure" was actually coined by Dorothy Parker, to describe the attributes
of a Hemingway hero, but I'm not sure.  In any case, it seemed to describe
the theme of the songs for that album, as well as the difficulties of like in
the early '80s.  The dancer is no one in particular, though partly inspired
by the movie <strong>The Turning Point</strong>.

<strong>
a)  I've heard some curious stories about "Mr Big and the Royal Jamaicans" in
the <em>Power Windows</em> credits.  Is there a curious story to this?<br>
b)  In the credits for Metallica's <em>Master of Puppets</em>, they thank Rush.
 Why?<br>
c)  Is there any truth to the rumors that <em>Hold Your Fire</em> marks Rush's last
studio album and tour?</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
William Jackson<br>
Chippewa Falls WI</font><p>

<dl><dd>
a)  A curious story?  Afraid not.  They're <strong>cigars</strong>!<br>
b)  Honestly, I'm not exactly sure, though it was very nice of them.  Geddy
talked to them a bit about the music biz in general I think, and I talked to
Lars once on the phone about his drum kit.  I dunno.  But it was nice of
them.<br>
c)  Yes.  Absolutely the <strong>last</strong>.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
a)  Will there be any more concept albums in the vein of <em>Grace Under
Pressure?</em><br>
b)  What is the significance of YYZ?<br>
c)  Which of your albums is your favorite?</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Geoff Vontz<br>
Kansas City KS</font><p>

<dl><dd>
a)  Since <strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> wasn't a concept album, I guess I could
safely say there'll be others like it!  In fact, every one since that album
has had that in common -- it <strong>hasn't</strong> been a concept album.<br>
b)  YYZ is the aviation code for Toronto International Airport, and the song
is loosely based on airport-associated images.  Exotic destinations, painful
partings, happy landings, that sort of thing.<br>
c)  My favorite album is always the most recent I've done, and I have to
think you'd be in trouble if that weren't the case.  No, <strong>you</strong> 
wouldn't be in
trouble, I would -- if I believed that what I was doing now wasn't better than
what I used to do.  Happily, I've never had that fear.  (Though plenty of
others have had it <strong>for</strong> me, and they never hesitate to write 
and tell me so in the rudest terms.  Oh well, what do they know about my life 
and work? Zip.)

<strong>
What similarities can be found in the themes from Miller's <em>The 
Crucible</em> and Rush's "Witch Hunt".</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Grant Dawson<br>
Congers NY</font><p>

<dl><dd>
I'm not sure Grant, I haven't read *The Crucible*.  But I will one of these
days.

<strong>
Do you guys think that your continuity (pretty phenomenal by rock standards)
can be at all attributed to the fact that Alex and Neil are Virgos and Geddy
a Leo?  All your signs are very close together -- almost a mathematical
precision.</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
John Eric Michaels<br>
Scottsdale AZ</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Gosh, I don't know.  I don't really believe in astrology, but I don't
discount it out-of-hand either.  It's one of those things "Mystic Rhythms"
talks about -- "we suspend our disbelief, and we are entertained."  As long as
the <strong>President</strong> isn't being guided by astrologers (I know, I 
know) then it doesn't hurt anybody.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
Can you tell me why Alex or yourself has never sung the lead vocals on any of
the past Rush songs?</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Roger Glossner<br>
West Chester OH</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Roger, I'll leave that to your imagination.  But I am no threat to Luciano
Pavarotti.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
In the 1987 Rush concert, you showed a video which depicted a death row scene
(if I am not mistaken) for several minutes.  I was interested in what B & W
movie this came from.  </strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Randy W. Magin<br>
Greenfield MA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
No, you're not mistaken.  The movie was called *The Last Mile*, but I don't
know where you'd ever see it.  Maybe on the Late, Late Show on Channel 5.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
I can't find anywhere, anything about these things:<br>
a)  Xanadu<br>
b)  Tobes<br>
c)  a red Barchetta.  Is it a fictitious car?  From everything in the song,
it could be from any time period -- past, present, or future.<br>
d)  Narpets<br>
e)  Didacts -- The closet thing to it being "didactic," which means "intending
to teach."  So are didacts people intending to be teachers?  People with the
intention of teaching?  Or things intended to be taught?</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Chris Harvey<br>
Saint Paris OH</strong><p>

<dl><dd>
a)  See <strong>Citizen Kane</strong> and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's "Kublai 
Khan."<br>
b)  My friend's Dad always said "colder than the Tobes of Hell," that's all.
 I don't know what it means.<br>
c)  There is such a car, or at least a body style.  It means "little boat" in
Italian, but I would rather leave it timeless, as you have perceived it.<br>
d)  Play anagrams<br>
e)  Bingo -- a didact is a teacher.

<strong>
In July 1980 you recorded an album called <em>Universal Juveniles</em>.  Can you
tell me where I can buy one?</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Mark Paganelli<br>
Clinton MA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
No we didn't.  <strong>Universal Juveniles</strong> was by the band Max 
Webster, friends of
ours, and we played, together with them, on one song called "Battlescar."  As
to where you could get it, I can't imagine.
</dd></dl><P>

<strong>
I am interested in any information you could provide on two Rush releases
named Red Vinyl.  I believe Neil mentioned two singles that were not released
with the first album, but separately.  Is there any way I can obtain a copy
or info on how to send for one?</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Kerry Duprey<br>
Barnstable MA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Ain't no such thing, Kerry.  Two singles of ours were released 
<strong>on</strong> red vinyl
(I don't remember which ones), which must be what you've heard about.  There
were <strong>no</strong> singles released separately from albums -- everything 
we've ever recorded has been for, and on, an album.
</dd></dl><p>

<strong>
Lyrics can form perceptions in people's minds subtly.  How did you decide to
name Cygnus's ship Rocinante?  From what I know, Rocinante was a pony for a
fictitious Spanish Conquistador.  (Like there ever was an <em>English</em>
Conquistador!)</strong><br>
<font size=-1>
Mike Cooper<br>
Ontario CA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
Whoa -- I had to put this one in just because it has a 
<strong>joke</strong> in it.  Nice one
Mike!  Let's have more jokes, people -- it makes a nice change from all this
deadly seriousness.  Anyway, Rocinante was Don Quixote's horse, and also the
name of John Steinbeck's truck in <strong>Travels With Charley</strong>.  I 
just liked it, that's all.  Like your joke...<p>

Mike had another question too, but I didn't understand it:<p>

<strong>
In Hemispheres, there are three gods who are fused, eventually, in a dream,
or sphere.  To me, the sphere is a brain, with Apollo forming the ordered
portion, Dionysus forming the more creative side, and Cygnus (The Link)
developing into the Cerebrum and Cortex, the moral judgement center.  I also
harbor the idea that the hemispheres are just that, east and west, divisions
(or subdivisions) of man and his mind.  Which if either is correct in your
mind as long as your music inspires thought?</strong><p>

Gee, um...yeah, that's it -- I don't mind as long as our music inspires
thought...
