<font size=+1>
The Story Of An Album</font><br>
<font size=-1><em>

<p>

    On June the fourth 1979, the "Tour of the Hemispheres" was brought to a
successful, but relieved close, at the Pink Pop Festival, in The Netherlands.
After eight months of touring across Canada, the United States, Great Britain,
and Western Europe, it is probably self-evident that we were all very glad to
be returning home for our first summer vacation in about four years! One
forgets what a stately and serene thing summer can be when subjected to the
almost uninterrupted overcast skies which are native to South Wales, where
our last two summers were spent. Out of one period of three weeks, two summers
ago, the sun only shone for two days! We might get rid of our green suntans!<p>

    This also marked the first time that we had ever taken time off prior
to recording an album, our usual schedule consisting of tour, tour, tour,
write-rehearse-record, and then perhaps a couple of brief weeks of Domestic
Therapy in which to attempt to glue yourself back together before going on
the road again. The advantages of a rest between touring and writing new
songs are probably readily apparent to the discerning reader, and certainly
proved themselves to us in the making of this record, however such a liberty
had never before been economically possible for us. (Nor this time either,
really). Such indulgence!<p>

    It was one of those classic, golden days of mid-July, six relaxing and
enjoyable weeks later, we all made our way northward, to a small town not
far from Georgian Bay, where we were to begin writing and rehearsing some
new material. The place was Lakewoods Farm, a rambling and comfortable old
farm-house, somewhat modernized, surrounded by a hundred acres of farmland,
including a barn containing many interesting and articulate cows, and
fascinating fields of dynamic wheat! About a quarter of a mile distant from
the house was a rough little cottage, set on a tiny jewel of a lake, which
proved to be the perfect setting for a flow of lyric writing.<p>

    I arrived in the afternoon to find Alex happily at work in the kitchen
preparing his famous lasagna, as he is our willing and able chef at every
possible occasion (even on the bus microwave!), and from the basement came
the exploratory mewings of the long-awaited Interface, a device which would
allow Geddy to trigger all of the voices in his Polyphonic synthesizer by
depressing one pedal of his Taurus Bass Pedals. This would give a rich and
readily attainable texture to add to our sound, and came in very useful
indeed. As did Alex's cooking.<p>

    So here we were, tanned, healthy, and well-rested, fair bursting with
new ideas, and our gear crammed wall to wall in the basement. The first
night we put together a giant hodge-podge of instrumental mish-mash, which
we christened "Uncle Tounouse". It never became anything itself, but parts
of it were plundered bit by bit to form quite a few other things. We soon
settled into a schedule which both suited and served us well. After a huge
breakfast from Alex, I would gather my things and walk down to the cottage,
to spend the afternoon working on lyrics, while Alex and Geddy would descend
to the basement to work on musical ideas. Within the first few days we had
put together "The Spirit of Radio", "Freewill", and "Jacob's Ladder", the
ideas flowing in such a smooth and painless way that it almost seemed too
 easy! The only complete lyrics I had brought with me were "Entre Nous",
and neither Alex nor Geddy had brought more than a few incomplete ideas,
just having clear and relaxed minds had made all this difference.<p>

    I had also been working on making a song out of a medieval epic from
King Arthur's time, called "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". It was a real
story written around the 14th century, and I was trying to transform it
while retaining it's original form and style. Eventually it came to seem
too awkwardly out of place with the other material we were working on, so
we decided to shelve that project for the time being. (More on that later).<p>

    One of the great feature attractions at Lakewoods Farm was Alex's
radio-controlled airplane and it's dramatic succession of "horrible
crashes", into the trees, the fields, the cows, and finally to meet it's
end on a combination of chimney and roof. One day, four of us spent about
four hours combing the waist-high fields in search of the out-of-control
plane, and Alex would spend hours every day re-assembling the pieces with
gallons of epoxy, styrofoam cups elastic bands, toothpicks, bits of plastic
etc. Most entertaining!<p>

    These two idyllic weeks in the country were soon over, however, and
it was time for the next step, into the Demo studio. We moved into a small
studio in North Toronto called the Sound Kitchen, where we would be able
to record the songs in a rough fashion, to hear what they really sounded
like, and if they were any good or not! (All recording at the farm had been
handled by the Slider JVC mobile unit, leaving him without a cassette
player!) Also we had to prepare ourselves for an upcoming series of dates,
which were to hone ourselves into razor-sharp precision prior to entering
the studio proper. We spent our time here refining and rehearsing the
arrangements, again aided and edited by the keen perception and critical
appraisal of the omniscient Broon, our beloved and belaboured co-producer.
We also were to spend the last few days putting together a stage
presentation, and polishing up our older material. This we now did.<p>

    During this "Semi-tour of Some of the Hemispheres", we were able to
play "The Spirit of Radio", "Freewill", and "Jacob's Ladder" during our
soundcheck every day, and the former two we had worked into the new show.
This marked another significant historical first, the first time any amount
of new material had been performed live prior to being recorded. The last
song to receive this valuable advantage had been "Xanadu", and before that
I think you'd have to go way back to the "Fly by Night" album to find any
other examples of that phenomenon. Although it was only a three and a half
week tour, we did cover most of the area of the United States, along with
two shows each in Canada and England, and by it's end we and the songs were
certainly ready for the Main Event: Le Studio.<p>

    Le Studio is a wonderful place, nestled in a valley of the Laurentian
Mountains about sixty miles north of Montreal. It is situated on 250 acres
of hilly, wooded land, surrounding a private lake. At one end of the lake
is the studio, with the luxurious and comfortable guest house situated at
the other, about a mile away. We commuted by bicycle, rowboat, on foot, or
in laziness or bad weather, by car. We arrived in the full, ripe glory of
autumn, and were there through a genuine Indian Summer, and we heralded
the coming of snow and winter, all in our four week stay! The recording
facilities are, of course, nothing les than excellent in every way. The
room itself features one whole wall of glass, overlooking a spectacular
view of the lake and the mountains. This is in direct contrast to most
studios, which are more in the way of being isolated, timeless vaults,
which in that respect of course, are not necessarily bad. Here, though,
we worked in the light of the sun, and one could watch the changing seasons
in idle moments, rather than a dimly lit, smoky view of musical and
electronic hardware. Our engineer, Paul Northfield, soon proved himself to
be a helpful, capable, and congenial member of the project, as did all of
the excellent people who were employed there. I don't think we have ever
been so well treated anywhere. Alex's place in the kitchen was taken over
by the wondrous Andre, who would bring the most amazing French food to the
house, or we could alternate by going on an "outing" to his restaurant, "La
Barratte", which was in a nearby town. Suffice to say that we were well fed
as well!<p>

    The great contributions put forth by Daisy, Mr. Broon's little cocker
spaniel must also be acknowledged. She was with us for the whole session,
and her state-of-the-art sleeping and running around were an inspiration to
us all!<p>

    We began our great labors by working on the individual sounds of the
instruments. This consists of the musician banging away at his particular
object, while the engineering types experiment with different microphones,
mic positionings, and their own arcane world of knob-twiddling, faders,
echoes, equalization, etc., refining the sound to a true and/or pleasing
reproduction of the original. Once this has been accomplished, the three
of us will play together, probably going over the song we plan to record
first, and considerably more work is put into the sounds, to make them sit
together properly.<p>

    By about the second day these complexities have been resolved to
everyone's satisfaction, and work begins on the "basic track", or "bed
track", or "rhythm track", take your pick! This is accomplished by the
three of us performing the song, pretty much as we usually would, except
that things such as vocals, acoustic guitars, lead guitar, synthesizers,
and percussion are omitted. The reason for this is that better separation,
and more control over the eventual balance and quality of sound, is possible
when these lead parts, or embellishments, are recorded separately, once a
good rhythm track has been captured. Now we will be playing the song again
and again until the best performance, both in it's execution and it's
overall "feel", has been put onto the master tape. Here is where our
preparation really proved it's value, as we were able to record basic tracks
for "The Spirit of Radio", "Freewill", "Jacob's Ladder", and "Entre Nous"
in an amazingly short time, as well as arrange and record the previously
unrehearsed "Different Strings", which we had been saving for the studio
as a sort of production number.<p>

    There was still a gaping hole in our plans, however, for with the
departure of "Gawain" we had left ourselves nothing with which to replace
him! So..., at this juncture we parted ways, Alex, Geddy, Terry, and Paul
to begin work on some of the overdubs, while I would be imprisoned in my
room until I could emerge glowing triumphantly, clutching some wonder of
spontaneous genius to my knotted and sweated brow!! - mere fantasy I fear.
Did I perhaps have a title? Ah, no. Did I have a few strong ideas lying
around? Well, no. Did I have any ideas at all? Well, maybe, but not exactly.
And for two days I stared in frustration and growing unease at blank sheets
of paper, and questioning eyes. There is no doubt that working under
pressure can be very rewarding, as we have found many times in the studio.
It seems as if the creative mind slips into a burst of overdrive, allowing
a brief, exhausting, but productive surge in the creative process. On the
third day of my confinement this phenomenon arrived at last, and something
new began to take shape. It was the product of a whole host of unconnected
experiences, books, images, thoughts, feelings, observations, and confirmed
principles, that somehow took the form of "Natural Science". At any rate,
there it was, I liked it, and the others liked it too, so we began another
brainstorming session to set the monster to music.<p>

    It was at this point in out story when the visitors arrived, in the
person of Fin Costello, our effervescent and ever-ready Irish photographer,
and our equally manic art director, Hugh Syme. This would be the first time
that we had ever been photographed while working in the studio, but we have
maintained such a long and amicable relationship with these two characters,
that there was little self-consciousness on our part. We just carried on
working, while Fin went to work at capturing the moments you will see on the
cover of the record. There was, of course, much silliness, as when Hugh led
the band in an insane and endless version of "Ruff and Reddy", (!), but we
somehow found time to utilize Hugh's piano artistry, on "Different Strings",
which sounds very good indeed, doesn't it? (You're welcome, Hugh)<p>

    To digress for a moment on the subject of the cover, planning and
organizing had been going on in the background for the last couple of weeks.
The album still had not received a title right up to the time when we were
ready to record, every time we came up with something it seemed to be
already taken. Even when we did settle on the one, it immediately popped
up all over the place too, but by now it was too late, as the artwork was
already in progress, and we knew it to have been an original idea, if not
the only one. Hugh is the main person involved in putting the cover together,
but we also contribute to the general layout, compiling the credits, choosing
the photos, correcting and submitting the lyrics, and arguing about all of
the things that we want and the record companies don't. There are always the
inevitable last minute crises, such as the Chicago Daily Tribune being still
so embarrassed about their "Dewey defeats Truman" error of more than thirty
years ago, that they actually refused to let us use it on the cover! These
things are sent to try us!<p>

    Meanwhile, back in Le Studio, "Natural Science" was becoming a song,
forged from some bits from "Gawain", some instrumental ideas that were still
unused, and some parts newly-written. This is where we used up some of the
time that we had gained earlier, as we had to work a lot on refining and
rehearsing something as new and complex as this had grown to be. We were
about halfway through our time there, and ready to move into the "Overdub
Mode".<p>

    Mention must now be made of the great game of volleyball. At dinnertime,
and after the sessions at night, it was our great pleasure to play intensely
athletic and competitive volleyball. One of a few games played in the pouring
rain starred the members of Max Webster and their crew, while other games
would continue despite mud-mires or blinding snow. One particularly warm
night kept us playing until six o'clock in the morning! The studio's video
camera also proved to be an interesting source of entertainment, one notable
evening when created the "The Jack Secret Show", a half hour talk show
starring Jack, Punjabi, and many other famous and interesting guests!<p>

    Frivolities aside, the work continued as we plowed through a mountain
of overdubs. Alex and I splashed oars in the lake with shivering hands to
record the "Tide Pool" effects, voices and guitar sounds were sent out over
the lake to make use of it's natural echo, the tympani was recorded outdoors,
guitar amps were strung all over the building to take advantage of as many
different sounds as possible. The parade of guitars, synthesizers, vocals,
percussion, and experiments went on, and the days wore away. But... we
finished early! We had about three days at the end to spare, in which we
could make some rough mixes of the songs to take home and listen to before
the real mixing began. As straightforward and logical as this again must
sound, it was the first time that such a thing had ever happened. In the
past we had always had to begin mixing the day after the recording was
finished, giving no opportunity to get away from the material, and return
to it with a fresh, objective ear.<p>

    One week later, the four of us flew across to England to begin the two
weeks of our sojourn at Trident, which is buried in the small streets and
lurid night-life of the Soho district of London. This would be the final
stage in the album's history, the mixdown. I think that it is quite an
obscure thing to many people, just what is done here, so I'll take a moment
to try and clarify it. The album is actually complete at this point, at
least in terms of content, but there are a myriad of small adjustments,
individual sounds can be shaped slightly differently, relative balances can
be altered, echoes or other effects can be added to certain sounds to make
them more interesting or to punctuate them, and the overall sound is made
adaptable to different listening conditions or equipment.<p>

    Here once again, Alex moves into the kitchen, as Trident is so
completely equipped as to possess one, and proceeds to regale us yet
again with a series of delicious meals.<p>

    This is also the point at which Mr. Broon really comes into his own.
Taking over the engineering himself, the console becomes an instrument, as
he and his capable assistants orchestrate the faders and switches. The gods
once again rule in our favour, and we work ahead of schedule, our two weeks
at Trident speeding pleasantly by. Soon it is time for that most satisfying
and enjoyable of ceremonies, the Final Playback. This is the climax of the
whole project for us, the time when we stop working on the album, and just
listen to it. A few friends are invited, a goodly amount of Champagne is
consumed, and a relaxed and twisted time is had by all.<p>

    This is the moment for which all that has gone before becomes fair
value; all has been worth it. The moment when you sit back and think to
yourself: "It is good".<p>

We hope you agree.<p>

    I recently became the proud owner of a new set of Tama drums, once again
with the inner side of the wooden shells coated with the Vibra-Fibing
treatment. Along with the custom finish and the brass-plated metal hardware,
this operation was performed by the Percussion centre of Fort Wayne, Indiana.
The sizes of the drums remain unchanged, consisting of two 24" bass drums, 6",
8", 10" and 12" concert toms, 12", 13" 15" and 18" closed toms, and a
5 1/2 x 14" wooden snare drum. I probably need hardly add that both on the
road, and most especially on this newest record, I am very pleased with the
combination of the thick, wooden shells, and the dependable, modern hardware.<p>

    All my cymbals are still by Avedis Zildjian, with the exception of one 18"
chinese cymbal. They are a 6" and 8" splash, two 16", one 18", and one 20"
crash cymbals, a 22" ride, a pair of 13" high-hats, an 18" pang, and a 20"
China type.<p>

    Digging into the toy box we find the usual assortment of effects, including
timbales, melodic cowbells, orchestra bells, wind chimes, tubular bells, bell
tree, tympani, temple blocks, triangle, gong, and crotales.<p>

    On my snare and bass drums I use Remo black-dot heads, Ludwig silver-dots
on the concert toms, and Evans Looking Glass (top) and Blue Hydraulic (bottom)
on the other toms. Ludwig Speed King Pedals and Tama hardware complete the set-
up. My drumsticks are still Pro-Mark 747's with the varnish removed from the
gripping area.<p>

    My guitars are: two Rickenbacker 4001 basses, one Rickenbacker 4002 bass,
one custom-modified Fender Precision, one Fender Jazz Bass, and one
Rickenbacker custom double-neck, which incorporates a 4001 bass with a twelve-
string guitar. All basses are equipped with Badass bridges and Roto-Sound
strings, and a Roland chorus is used on the guitar.<p>

    My amps are two BGW 750-B's, running through two Ashley pre-amps, into two
Thiele-design 2 x 15 cabinets, and two Ampeg V4B 2 x 15 cabinets. All cabinets
are fitted with JBL K140 speakers, and I also use a Fender Twin Reverb amp for
guitar.<p>

    My synthesizer set-up has grown to: Mini-Moog, Oberheim polyphonic, OB-1,
an Oberheim digital sequencer, a Roland Space Echo, and Moog Taurus Pedals,
which are also interfaced with the Oberheim polyphonic.<p>

Standard, Gibson Custom Double-Neck, custom built Pyramid, Fender Stratocaster,
Roland Guitar Synthesizer, Gibson Dove, Gibson J-55, Gibson B-45-12, Gibson
C-60 classical, and a Ramirez Classical. I also play a set of Moog Taurus
Pedals.<p>

    My amplifiers are three Hiwatt 100's spread over four 4 x 12 cabinets and
one Leslie cabinet, with one spare amplifier and two spare cabinets. A Fender
Twin Reverb with JBL's is also used.<p>

    My effects are: three Roland 301 Space Echo's, one Roland Chorus, an
Electric Mistress, a Morley volume pedal, a Cry Baby wah-wah, a Maestro
parametric filter, Ashley pre-amps and parametrics for the acoustic guitars,
and a custom built effects board designed by L.B., and built by Steele-Power
Supply.<p>
