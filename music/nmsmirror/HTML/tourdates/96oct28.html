My experience with Rush is a simple one - I basically liked the
songs I heard on the radio but never made it a point to expand
my musical knowledge of the band. They never instilled that "I
have to buy the CD the day it comes out" attitude, but I wouldn't
change the station when a Rush song came on. But, back when I
was in college, I knew this guy who basically thought that the
trio that is called Rush might as well be the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost. I didn't realize how many people thought the same
thing until I caught Rush's show at The United Center in Chicago. <p>

As the place was filling up I was trying to figure out exactly what
could draw such a devout legion of fans to fill up one of the
larger indoor venues in Chi-Town, especially since they haven't
been out in the public eye in years and their new CD, "Test for
Echo," didn't seem to be getting much attention other than "hey,
there's a new Rush CD out." I guess I would have to wait about
another three hours to figure out what that drawing power is. In
the meantime I saw a show, complete with about a gazilion
lights, more mirrors than, well, a house of mirrors, a giant video
screen, and a stage set-up that included what looked like a
cardboard cut-out of a Baywatch dudette, an old-style
refrigerator, some old-style blender and milk-shake looking
things, and satellite dishes with lasers. Oh yea, there was music too. 

One thing I found out by seeing Rush live is that most of
that radio stuff doesn't do them justice as
musicians and music makers. Sure, the show
had many of those hits I was used to; your
"Subdivisions," "The Big Money," "Free Will,"
and their latest "Test for Echo," but I got to hear
many a many a many a song I have never heard
before. And I slowly started to realize just what
those 18,000ish fans saw in this band. <p>

As I stood and listened and watched I realized
that this Alex Lifeson character is one kick-ass
guitarist. As I stood and listened and watched I
realized that this Neil Peart character plays the
shit out of the drums with the best of them (and
he can spin a drumstick between his fingers
which I always find cool, and he had this
drum-set that spun around so it was actually two
drum sets, and he never missed a beat). As I
stood and listened and watched I realized that
this Geddy Lee character, although looking a little aged, still can direct 
this trio through musical experiences.
And you know, as I stood and listened and watched I realized that this crowd 
knew every word, every beat,
and appreciated every ounce of the show that Rush put on. It was cool. <p>

See, for all of you people like me who only know these
guys from the radio, I will tell you that you are missing
something. And I don't think that even just buying a CD or
two will add to that. The ultimate experience to change your
attitude about Rush is to be there with the worshipers,
follow their lead in the "shoving your fist in the air,"
"pretending to hit that cymbal crash" moment, and realize
that as musicians this band of three can blow away many a
band of, well, many. <p>

The band was great, although it did seem like it took a little
while for them to get into the music as much as the rest of
the crowd, and they had one of the better sound systems I
have seen (I really wish I could have surround sound
speakers like theirs in my living room!). The lighting effects
weren't overbearing, but added just enough, giving a little
kick when it needed but not annoying, and if you like a
good solo, from guitar to drum, this band puts it out there for you. <p>

I can't really say that I am now a member of the Church of
Rush, but I can say I have been enlightened a little. This is a
band that radio can never do justice, I guess mostly because
the really cool songs are too long. You sure as hell won't
hear many stations playing the full blown version of "2112"
that the band played at their show. It's too bad. <p>

The band played for nearly three hours - two sets with a
"Geritol" break of about 20 minutes in the middle. It was
three hours I can honestly say weren't wasted. I only had one problem with the 
show. Hmm, I don't know if it's a problem, it's just my feelings keep changing 
from "who cares?" to "What the hell does he need that for? Who's gonna care if 
he forgets a line, it will just add to this show being more special?" See, 
Geddy Lee was using a "lyric monitor." Basically a little TV that scrolls the 
lyrics to the songs so he doesn't have to worry about forgetting a line. Part 
of me says that it takes away from some of the spontenaity of a live show, but 
the techical part of me knows that it can really screw some things up, 
lighting and laser wise, if a song isn't played right. I guess it's just 
something that will continue to keep me awake at night. I can say this, 
whether the crowd knew it was there or not, they sure didn't seem to care, so, 
I guess I shouldn't care either. <p>

Oh yea, I have to rate the band! Well, I liked the show and the crowd seemed 
to love it, so it's going to be the TWO BIG GIANT THUMBS UP for Rush! <p>

That's it for this one, I'm The Dude on the Right! L8R!!! <p>

<font size=+1>RUSH SHOWS IT STILL CAN ROCK AFTER 22 YEARS</font><br>
<strong>by Bob Kurson</strong><p>

If you were a square-jawed, bully-brained high school jock in the '70s, odds
were you despised these things: vegetarians, members of the science club,
standardized personality tests, and the rock group Rush. Especially Rush.<p>

To many clean-cuts, Rush represents the apocalypse of rock. The band sang in
octaves high enough to make the Bee Gees blanch, wrote lyrics that vacillated
between befuddling gibberish with high-concept double-talk, and attracted the
grubbiest-looking fans this side of a Dead concert.<p>

Monday night at the United Center, Rush proved again why it has endured for
22 years despite the lack of endorsement from snobbish, pretty-boy critics:
they simply rock like hell.<p>

Covering songs from every period of its evolution (including the entirety of
"2112") Rush thrilled the near sell-out crowd with its usual display of
technical precision and lightning-quick musicianship. But the revelation this
night wasn't in individual flash, rather in the band's emergence as a
blistering and evolving rhythm unit.<p>

Staying true to the spirit of its recent stripped-down studio sound, Rush
favored lean and wicked grooves Monday night, cutting back a bit on the
elaborate solo histrionics that made them legends among wide-eyed teenagers
taking their first guitar of drum lessons. The results was a cleaner
performance in which the band's often complex songs were allowed to breathe
cleanly and throb seductively.<p>

But don't worry, speed freaks. Faster-than-Flash drummer Neil Peart continues
to serve as religious icon for two decades of hyperventalating air drummers,
many of whom recklessly whirled elbows, wrists and hair at the UC while
trying to match their hero note-for-note. And guitarist Alex Lifeson still
looks like he can keep up with furious-fingered youngsters half his age.<p>

Only bassist-singer Geddy Lee seems to have been affected by the years,
judiciously avoiding some of the ultra-high notes he once hit without
reserve. This caution was most notable during parts of "2112", when Lee
dropped his vocals an octave mid-song. But on other numbers, such as radio
hit "Closer to the Heart," he cranked it up and hit the top floor.<p>

Rush will forever be criticized for taking itself too seriously, but the
Toronto-bred trio truly looked like they were having fun Monday night. And
though many of their fans arrived bleary-eyed and still long-haired after 22
years, they, too, looked like they were having fun. That's not a bad secret
for rock critics to remember.

<font size=+1>Cranked-up Rush doesn't let fans down at United Center</font><br>
<strong>By Greg Kot</strong><p>

     Teenagers in the 1970's had a choice:  Blast Rush on the eight-track
while kicking back in the school parking lot, or cinch up the leather jacket
& silently wish that Rush's helium-voiced Geddy Lee would choke on a high
note.<p>
     The ultimate rite-of-passage band, Rush remains a primarily
testosterone-laden enterprise.  At the sold-out United Center on Monday, the
Canadian trio's audience was, at least 75% male, & most of them appeared to
know every lyric & anticipated every chord change with the accuracy of
lifetime obsessives.<p>
     Even though it flies well below the radar of mainstream record
business, Rush has endured & even flourished.  Despite only one Top-40 hit,
the Canadian trio has released 20 albums in 25 years & routinely sells out
arenas whenever it tours.  Like the Grateful Dead, Rush is among the biggest
cult bands in the world-reviled, misunderstood or dismissed by the
uninitiated, but virtually the only band that matters within its tight
circle of worshipers.<p>
     Rush revels in its normalcy, its utter lack of fashionability, & in its
distaste for love songs.  Singer-bassist Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson, &
drummer Neil Peart instead indulge instrumental flash & pseudo-philosophical
lyricism-the coolly cerebral music & message in perfect sync.<p>
     Though revered as a technician, Peart doesn't really swing & he sure
isn't funky.  But that matters little.  The bands' best-known compositions,
such as the epic "2112," performed Monday in its 20-minute plus entirety,
are like roller coaster, in which tempos shift constantly.  At this game,
Peart has few peers.  His four-limbed polyrhythms give the illusion of
racing thru an obstacle course at breakneck-speed, barely eluding a crash
with each sudden shift in direction.<p>
     With the aid of electronic pads on which he was able to pound out some
melody lines, the drummer actually turned his solo into something more that
a '70's cliche.  Not so much an improvisation as a composition, the Peart
solo demonstrated a sense of groove missing from the rest of the show; for a
brief moment it seemed there would be dancing at a Rush concert.<p>
     But before anything so rash occurred, Lifeson & Lee returned to the
stage & they burrowed into the labyrinthine twists & turns of "Natural
Science," another rarely performed cut resurrected for this performance-a 3
hour career retrospective balancing crowd pleasers such as "Tom Sawyer,"
"The Trees" and "The Big Money" with a healthy dose of the most recent
album, "Test for Echo."<p>
     On newer material such as "Virtuality" and "Driven," Rush epitomized
power-trio hard rock while demonstrating a feel for more nuanced textures.
 Although the group's songwriting has always been problematic, with slight
melodies propped up by complex arrangements, Rush has lately been paring
away some of the filigree & synth overkill in favor of a more direct,
guitar-driven approach.<p>
     Most notably, Lee's once infernally high voice has lowered an octave or
two, & it sounds warmer & more natural than before.  A handful of vintage
tunes such as "Closer to the Heart" still require him  to sing as though
he's being stabbed with a fork, an affectation that apparently continues to
bring pleasure to great numbers of Rush fans judging by the number of
lighters that illuminated the arena.  For some people, the eight-track in
the school parking lot is still cranked.
