Although the sound is slightly worse than on the "Cygnus" boot, here you get
the advantage that you're getting the whole concert. However, the two discs
come in the now "environment-unfriendly" large double-cd case. Geddy does
mention that this is their 3rd night in Chicago, so the date on the case is
most likely correct.<p>

The sound does get off to a shaky start, but the volume increases quickly.
During the very quiet parts (inbetween songs), you can hear hiss, probably
because this was recorded off a tape. In places it seems that the tape speeds
up slightly, or slows down. This was definitely done as an audience tape -- 
you can hear several people arguing about seats during "Bangkok".<p>

The quality fluctuates, and at one point sounds like someone hit the recorder.
It does cut out in a few places; it's hard to tell if it's chopping off music
as well. Generally though, a very decent sounding show. One nice thing is it 
sounds like a small venue, and during the music you don't hear much talking. 
Another good thing is (of course) the song selection! If you like 
pre-Permanent Waves Rush, you'll love this, although Caress of Steel is 
sorely underrepresented. And I loved the transition between "By-Tor" and
"Xanadu"! However, because of tape limitations some parts of songs do get cut
off when the tape was flipped.<p>

Packaging? Not on this one! There's a bad color photocopy of Neil for the 
cover, and a worse one of the Hemispheres album cover for the back. There is
no booklet included. The cds themselves are gold with green undersides -- if I
didn't know better, I'd think these were CDROM discs pressed at home.<p>

A decent show overall, and definitely worth a listen, especially if you're a
big fan of their longer "epic" songs. It also would be fairly simple to buy a
single double-cd case and dump the larger one it comes in.
