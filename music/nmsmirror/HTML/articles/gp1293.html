Rush strips down<br><br>

  "We wanted to be that energetic three-piece band we were in
the past," says Alex Lifeson, explaining the harder, leaner
sound of Rush's <strong>Counterparts</strong>. "We decide to strip down our
approach and bring up my guitar."<p>

  Lifeson plays a dominant role throughout, cutting loose with
charging riffs and tough tones that harken back to the band's
influential <strong>Moving Pictures</strong>. "For the first time in 12
years," he divulges, "I recorded the guitars in the studio
instead of the control room. I had two amps blaring at me. It
took a couple f days to get used to it, but after that, man, I
<strong>loved</strong> it. I could feel the wood vibrating against my body
and hear the amps coming through the pickups. I got caught up
in the whole energy of the sound and the room. I thought,
"Where have I been, missing all this?"."<p>

  Such a white-knuckle approach, Alex acknowledges, requires
sacrifice: "Your headphones are thumping away -- you know it's
killing your ears- and communicating with the engineer is
slower. But you feel so connected to the music. I wouldn't
trade it for anything; I'm surprised I didn't clue in on this
sooner."<p>

  While Rush revived classic studio techniques for 
<strong>Counterparts</strong>, they felt no need to alter their 
pre-production scheme.
As they have for years, the band developed sophisticated
song demos before setting foot in the land of 2" tape. Alex
and bassist Geddy Lee used Alesis ADAT 8-track digital recorders
to audition ideas and refine parts. Later they transfer
red those tapes to the studio's multitrack, and the home
recordings became guide tracks. One by one, the trio overdub
bed their respective parts, replacing the originals. Lifeson
printed his guitars to analog tape; everything else was captured
digitally.<p>

  On several songs, including the punchy "Cut To The Chase",
Lifeson's bandmates encouraged him to keep the original guide
solos. "Solos are a funny thing," Alex observes, "Many solos I
record at the demo stage make it to the final mix. I tend to
be a perfectionist, but I've come to realize my best work is
spontaneous. An unrehearsed solo may not be particularly in
time or in tune, but it can possess an emotional quality
that's very difficult to recapture. At this point, I'd rather
live with some technical imperfections."<p>

  Lifeson cut his ADAT parts by sending a direct line from his
Gallien-Krueger amp to a Palmer speaker simulator and then to
the mixer. He added effects while tracking. In the studio,
however, Alex pounded his riffs through two heads -- a Peavey
5150 and a 100-watt Marshall- with 4x12 cabinets. "For all the
bed tracks, I plugged straight into the amps, with no effects,
and cranked it up."<p>

  Unlike players who hire a cartage service to haul dozens of
guitars to a session, Alex says he relied on a few familiar
friends for <strong>Counterparts</strong>. "I mostly played my Paul Reed
Smith, Les Paul, and Tele. I played the Paul a lot -- it's
prominent on "Stick It Out", for example. Quite often I combined
the Tele with the Paul to create a single sound. Lifeson
also likes to layer acoustic guitars: "I have a big, sort of
metallic sounding Washburn and a Gibson Dove that's soft and
delicate. The two together made a very complete sound. I also
used a Nashville-tuned Gibson J-55, which we mixed in and
out." (For this "high-strung" Nashville tuning, Alex replaced
the lowest four strings with lighter gauges and tuned them up
an octave.)<p>

  It's no surprise that <strong>Counterparts</strong> acoustic guitars recall
<strong>Tommy</strong>-era Who tracks. "Pete Townshend can make an acoustic
sound so heavy and powerful," affirms Alex. "I've always
admired that. On "Between Sun And Moon" there's a musical
bridge  before the solo that's very Who-ish. I even throw
Keith Richards in there." Lyrically and musically, Lifeson
notes, the song is "really a tribute to the '60s." Yet these
days, he find himself listening to contemporary players.
"Particularly Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains -- I've been really
getting off on <strong>Dirt</strong>. And I love Eric Johnson's playing."<p>

  Soon, Lifeson plans to return to basics with his stage
setup. "For the next tour, I want te revamp my whole line. I'm
planning on using Marshalls again, after a 15 years hiatus.
I'll be playing my PRS guitars; I might even break out the Les
Paul for one or two songs." In the '80s, the Canadian favored
single-coils. "To be quite honest," he reveals, "I've moved
away from that sound; I much prefer the warmth of humbuckers."<p>

  Creativity, concedes Alex, runs in cycles. "After we finish
a record, I put my guitar down and don't play for months. When
I pick it up again, I really stink. It takes me a while to get
back into shape, but in the process, I start playing things I
never would have thought of before. I discover different
styles." Exploring the fretboard in solitude is rejuvenating,
says Lifeson: "My greatest enjoyment is sitting alone in my
home studio, playing through my amp with a really great sound.
Not working on a song, just playing. I get completely lost and
the hours fly by. I still do it, after all these years."<p>
