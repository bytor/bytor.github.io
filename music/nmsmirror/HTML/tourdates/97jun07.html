Rush reveals maturity, freshness</font><br>
<strong>by A. Scharnhorst</strong><p>

Through the years, Rush has taken iths hits for coming of age in the
musically excessive '70s - and for taking its ethereal, keyboard-based,
sci-fi rock all too seriously.<p>

What's a trio of thoughtful Canadian boys to do?<p>

Maybe keep thinking, keep writing, keep touring and keep doing what built
the band a fan base in the first place.<p>

That's what Rush did-for the most part-during it's three hour extravaganza
Saturday night at Sandstone Amphitheater. The noted exception, though, was
that Rush has matured over time, bringing a richness and perspective to its
music that wasn't there two decades ago.<p>

This tour, behind the 1996 album "Test For Echo," is a delicately balanced
blend of the old and the new-Rush's attempt to build on the foundation it
laid with such seminal works as "2112," "A Farewell to Kings," and
"Hemispheres." Moving into the '90s, the band recreated its timeworn hits
with startlingly gritty freshness.<p>

Vocalist Geddy Lee, who doubles as an impressive bassist, brought a grounded
quality to his distinctively soaring vocals. Neil Peart, an accomplished
drummer, played with a straight-ahead style that belied his progressive rock
roots. Guitarist Alex Lifeson cranked out driving riffs that crackled with
newfound energy.<p>

An expected highlight was the complete version of the mini rock opera
"2112," an album-side musical tapestry that defines the band's sound. But
equally compelling were recent tracks-the grinding "Driven" or the rocking
instrumental "Limbo."<p>

With funky bass breaks, guitar-intensity changes and peppery drum solos,
Rush infused its often-self-conscious music with elements of fun. Somehow,
though, the band stayed true to its past at the same time.<p>

It's a tricky task.<p>

Maybe that's what careful thought and a dose of seriousness can accomplish.<p>

An official attendance figure was not available at press time.<p>
