Reprise Surprise: Rush's 2nd show wont "Echo" 1st
</font><P>

It seems like yesterday that the Canadian power trio, Rush last appeared in
the valley, it nearly was. The band hit America West Arena in November,
basically yesterday in terms of large-scale rock tours.<p>

"Our touring schedule is so goofy, we decided to go  out and hit some cities
that were not available  to us when we first  went on the road," explains
Geddy Lee, whose instantly identifiable vocals give the band its hallmark
sound. "It turns out we were kind of in the Southwestern area anyway, so it
made sense to stop back in and do another show."<p>

People hesitant about seeing an encore performance of November's concert
shouldn t worry, Lee says, promising some new tricks when the band plays
Desert Sky tonight.<p>

"Actually, it sort of keeps us on our toes," he says. "Its forced us to make
some changes, to move a few songs around, to change the visuals and add some
new material we didn t play last time."<p>

Last year's tour supporting Test for Echo album came after an 18 month
sabbatical. It was the longest stretch away from the road that the band had
ever taken. The break was necessary, Lee says.<p>

"We were taking each other for granted. It's kind of inevitable, I think. We
lost the ability to see the strengths that we have as individuals and that
we bring into the band." Was there any chance of the group splitting?<p>

"Well, no one really said those words, but there was alot of stuff  bubbling
under the surface." Those words are sure are sure to strike fear in the
hearts of lovers of the trio's epic sounding anthems. With guitarist Alex
Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart, Rush has been a mainstay since 1974's self
titled debut.<p>

The trio always has been known for its sharp musical skills. Even detractors
who miss Rush as bombastic dinosaurs have to admit the guys are first rate
players. That could be one reason for Rush's reputation as a "guys band."<p>

"Yeah, we ve always been a kinda 'what kind of guitar strings do you use'
kind of band." Lee says with a chuckle. "A 'hey, Geddy throw me a pick'
band.<p>

"We began as a hard edge players band, a band of musicians dedicated to
playing as fast as we could. Our arrangements were complex. We really were
more a musicians' band, and most young musicians are guys, so our fans were
young guys."<p>

Strangely, as the members settle into middle age -- Peart is the oldest at
44 -- the group's following seems to be widening. "We seem to be one of
these bands that always attracts a certain number of kids, and there s
always young musicians who are motivated by the musicianship aspect of the
band, the conceptual side of the band. It's almost like a rite of passage
for some younger guys, I think."<p>

If some of those younger fans would listen closely to the band's intricate
arrangements, they probably could detect a jazz bent to some of the group's
work. Lee agrees, but doesn t think that the band ever will pursue that
format with any passion. "There are moments, particularly in our
instrumental material, that lean toward jazz from time to time."<p>

"But no matter how you cut the cake, jazz fusion is not a whole lot of fun
to listen to. It's great if you're a jazzier, not so great if you're a
rocker. Something in the core of what we are is more akin to rock than jazz.
If it starts to feel to loungey to us, we d rather turn the amps up than go
jazzier."<p>
