###  I saved this off of alt.music.rush a while ago, and noticed it

Ok, here's _Nobody Hero_ by Rush from _Counterparts_.

A brief note on chords. There are 3 chord namings which I should explain.

1) The suspended seconds (sus2). People with some chord theory should know
this, but for the less informed, its always root 5th barre chord with the
2nd string "open". So a Csus2 is played like:
E|-3-   For the Bbsus2 just move down the fret board. The Ebsus2 is played
B|-3-   differently. See below.
G|-5-   
D|-5-   
A|-3-
E|---

2) The Ebsus2. This has a very low sound to it, so I think Alex fingers it 
like so:
E|-1-   
B|-4-   
G|-3-
D|-1-
A|-1-
E|---

3) The Gm/A. Now I *know* this is the wrong name for the chord, but I have
absolutely no idea what its proper name is. My handy-dandy book of 7,488 
guitar chords doesn't seem to have it. Anyway, I finger it like this:
E|-3-   If this looks kinda wacko, there is precedent for it. Alex plays
B|-3-   the same chord in _Lock and Key_. Check the video if you don't
G|-3-   believe me :-)
D|-5-
A|-3-
E|-5-

The "Gm/A" chord may not sound quite right when you play it, but that's 
probably because Alex uses a "Nashville tuning" technique for his guitar. 
I'm not terribly familiar with this method, but I believe it involves 
replacing the low, heavy, E, A, D strings with lighter guage ones so they 
are tuned up to the same octave as the higher strings. So when you listen 
to the cd at the "Gm Gm/A" change, it actually sounds like the change in 
fingering is occuring on the higher stirings, but I don't think it is. It 
sounds to me like the E, B, and G strings are unchanged through that chord 
change. But anyway, if you think you have a better idea than that by all 
means correct me.

As far as the two solos go, I haven't had time to figure them out, so they 
aren't included. Chords only. Sorry.

Strumming is pretty much the key to this tune. There is no way I can
effectively transcribe the strumming pattern here but if you listen to the
cd and get a feel for the rhythm and where the chord changes occur, you
should be able to get pretty close to the original.

Warning: Playing this song on an acoustic with a thick neck may cause
severe cramping of the left hand (it did for me anyways - but then maybe its
just me; I get the same thing playing Distant Early Warning). :)

So, on with our show.


Nobody's Hero - Music by Lee and Lifeson
-------------   Lyrics by Peart

intro:
Gm F Bbsus2 Csus2
Gm Gm/A F

verse 1:
Gm            F                Bbsus2
I knew he was different in his sexuality
Gm            Gm/A           F
I went to his parties as the straight minority
   Gm             F            Bbsus2
He never seemed a threat to my masculinity
   Gm        Gm/A          F
He only introduced me to a wider reality

Ebsus2

       Gm           F       Bbsus2
As the years went by we drifted apart
       Gm                Gm/A          Dm           Csus2   Bbsus2
When I heard that he was gone I felt a shadow cross my heart 

chorus1:
                    Dm
But he's nobody's Hero 
                   Csus2
- Saves a drowning child
          Am              G
- Cures a wasting disease

  F
Hero
                   Am               &lt; --  I hear a Dm here...   Z.
- Lands a crippled airplane
               Csus2     G
- Solves great mysteries     

  Dm
Hero
                   Csus2
- Not the handsome actor
                Am          G 
  who plays the hero's role

  F
Hero
                  Dm
- Not the glamour girl
                Csus2
  who'd love to sell her soul

   Am        G        Dm
If anybody's buying Nobody's Hero

verse2:
  Gm              F          Bbsus2
I didn't know the girl but I knew her family
Gm                   Gm/A           F
All their lives were shattered in a nightmare of brutality
     Gm             F            Bbsus2
They tried to carry on, tried to bear the agony
Gm                 Gm/A         F
Tried to hold some faith in the goodness of humanity

Ebsus2

       Gm           F      Bbsus2
As the years went by we drifted apart
       Gm                 Gm/A          Dm           Csus2   Bbsus2 Gm
When I heard that she was gone I felt a shadow cross my heart 

chorus2:
                     Dm
But she's Nobody's Hero
                  Csus2

  Who plays the perfect game

  F
Hero
                  Dm
- Not the glamour boy
               Csus2 
  Who loves to sell his name

Everybody's buying Nobody's Hero
