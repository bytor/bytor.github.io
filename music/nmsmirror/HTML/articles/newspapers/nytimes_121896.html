<font size=+1>Rush Updates Its Sense of Alienation</font><br>
<b>by BEN RATLIFF</b><p>

Back in the '70s, there were a number of bands like
Rush. The group's lyrics convey a fascination and a loathing for
technology. It uses huge symbolic totems to transmit the thematic
meaning of each album. It speaks for the alienated, yet flirts with
the alienation effect in its music. They are
post-modernity-watchers: They once even thanked NASA on an album
sleeve for letting them attend the launching of a space shuttle.<p>

But now Rush is a specialty act, and the preponderance of fans
over 30 filling the seats of the Continental Arena on Monday night
confirmed that the band has settled comfortably into 1981-model
amber. The Canadian trio is touring behind its 21st album, "Test
for Echo" (Atlantic), frying North American arenas with
electronically assisted high frequencies, exact odd-meter passages
and the glottal wail of the band's bassist and singer, Geddy Lee.<p>

As before, generalized frustration with society is still an
important theme in the group's lyrics. But the new songs,
addressing such topics as televised murder trials and
cyber-communication, have shifted the locus of alienation from a
high-school mind to that of a middle-aged libertarian searching for
meaning in an unhealthy, dangerous world.<p>

Fast-cutting video backdrops like a hundred flipped television
channels illustrated the songs, a good old device for conveying a
world gone mad. Rush has hundreds of images in its paranoia bank,
but the ones that kept popping up were Richard Nixon, J.F.K.,
Jacqueline Onassis and fashion-magazine models. (One of the most
charming aspects of the band's Ayn Randian mindset is that they're
still shocked by advertising.)<p>

The concert mixed new material with back catalogue hits
including "Subdivisions" and "Tom Sawyer"; a long stretch from
their album-length suite "2112" brought the crowd to standing
ecstasy. Still, the presentation was so hard and shiny that it was
nearly impossible to discern whether the players were having a good
or bad night. Rush used to have more of an improvisational
esthetic, but Alex Lifeson's guitar solos were few and quite short;
the music is built on chords and changing time signatures, with the
occasional gentle strumming in a highly arranged introduction or
coda.<p>

The exception and the climax was Neil Peart's drum solo, a
10-minute polyrhythmic bonanza performed on two different drum sets
accessed by means of a revolving platform. With cowbells,
synthesized pads, cymbals of every description, Peart's drum set
was a small nation-state unto itself. It was a dream of a drum set,
a thing of comically vast proportions -- like the band's idea of a
protest song.<p>
