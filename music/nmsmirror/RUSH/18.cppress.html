<LI>One of rock's most successful, enduring, and unique propositions, Rush
continues to surprise and captivate, 19 years after the release of their
first album.
<LI>In 1989, the Canadian super-trio made their Atlantic label debut with
<strong>"PRESTO,"</strong> inaugurating a dynamic new phase in the band's 
career.  That phase continued to gather momentum with 1991's <strong>"ROLL 
THE BONES,"</strong> which
soared past the platinum mark, yielding the hit title track as well as
"Dreamline", an AOR smash.
<LI><strong>"COUNTERPARTS,"</strong> Rush's 19th album and the third for 
Atlantic Records,
simultaneously harkens back to the group's power trio roots while
taking Rush's ever-evolving sound closer to the 21st century.
<LI>For the production of <strong>"COUNTERPARTS,"</strong> Rush teamed up 
with long-time
collaborator Peter Collins, whose credits include Rush's timeless <strong>"POWER
WINDOWS"</strong> album.  The result is a guitar-oriented, sonic bullet of an
album, the heaviest Rush record in years.
<LI>First radio track: "Stick It Out," a hard-driving, uptempo rocker that
takes Rush fans to the edge of the precipice and invites them to peer
out over the void.  Other standout tracks include "Animate" and
"Nobody's Hero."
<LI>There will be a companion video clip for the first single.
<LI>Atlantic will institute a pre-release television advertising campaign
to insure strong out-of-the-box sales.
<LI>A two-part consumer print ad campaign is in the works, with teaser ads
to run in October, followed by a full-blown November print advertising
campaign.
<LI>Rush will begin a six-month North American tour in Mid-January.  The
group's live following is both massive and totally loyal.
<LI>Insiders say <strong>"COUNTERPARTS"</strong> will react well at retail 
to live dates.
<LI>Merchandising materials: 1x1/Nameboard, Poster.
