by Arthur Treacher<br>
<em>November 1993</em>
<p>

Where would you rather play?<br>
Anywhere but here.<br>
When will the money be right?<br>
Anytime but now.<p>

With my balance sheet,<br>
I was counting for half the night.<br>
Wealthy and famous,<br>
So greedy and heartless.<br>
Make sure the contract's just right<br>
So many decisions, my agent's revisions<br>
Make the no trade clause airtight.<p>

Wilderness of dollars<br>
See how I must feel<br>
Bound in iron chains<br>
Try not to reveal<br>
My bank account's not shallow<br>
I will get the richest deal.<p>

Where would you rather play?<br>
Anywhere but here.<br>
When will the money be right?<br>
Anytime but now.<br>
The taunts and the jeers<br>
I know would all disappear.<br>
Anywhere but here.<p>

Wilderness of dollars<br>
Thats what I admire<br>
No precious sense of honor<br>
Its for money I aspire<br>
I'm making bank deposits<br>
While the owners all perspire<p>

Wilderness of dollars<br>
So easy to receive<br>
Without arbitration<br>
I would surely grieve<br>
My financial hardship<br>
So easy to relieve<p>

On the edge of sleep, I awoke to a sight so bright<br>
Awesome and peerless, cheered by your nearness<br>
I knew that this contract was right<br>
What made me decide, was the dollars inside<br>
The choice was for wealth out of sight<p>
