Nature has some new plague<br>
To live in our sheets<br>
Microbes in the wrinkles<br>
We must try to defeat<br>
Fugitives at the laundry room door<br>
Cleaners pause to find an open  store<br>
Clothing is spread all over the floor<br>
And there's no Tide lets get some more.<p>

THIS IS NOT A FALSE ALARM<br>
THIS IS NOT A TEST<p>

Stay out of the mud<br>
Even where clothing covers skin<br>
Dirt full of poison<br>
And my jeans are just to thin<br>
Bless the washer and mud no more<br>
Clothing stained by an open sore<br>
Black grime falling to the laundry room floor<br>
And all the Tide spilled by the door<p>

THIS IS NOT A FALSE ALARM<br>
THIS IS NOT A TEST<br>
Nothing we can clean away<br>
Dirt we cannot best<br>
The clothing is made ugly by<br>
An uninvited guest<p>

Deadline approaches<br>
Clothes full of sand<br>
They used to be spotless<br>
But now they are sticking to our hands<br>
Too late for debate, to bad to ignore<br>
That atrocious odor leads to open war<br>
Bring all our change to the corner store<br>
Hope they have Tide we need some more<p>

Now's the time to turn to Tide<br>
Now's the time to fight<br>
Let us not go dirty<br>
To the big event tonight<br>
Now's the time to clean the clothes<br>
While hope is still in sight<br>
Let us not go dirty<br>
To the big event tonight<p>
</body>
