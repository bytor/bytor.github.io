A subterranean voice growls across the phone wires, hesitates, and
growls again -- this time more softly. Canadian telephone service
might be different, but it's not supposed to be that foreign.<p>

"No, no," she explains, "Robert Plant sounds like the first voice,
Geddy Lee is so much smoother and more subdued." There's no denying a
fan's word, but Circus Magazine caught up with the vocal chords in
question in Spokane, Washington, to settle once and for all whether
Rush wasn't just another "junior Led Zeppelin." And learn a little
more about the growing success of All the World's a Stage (Mercury),
the live double-record set of this Northern power outfit, Rush --
Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart.<p>

"I don't acknowledge the resemblance the way most people do,"
said Geddy Lee, as he stretches out in an all too familiar
hotel room. All The World's A Stage is not just a catchy
title for Rush's most recent record, but a fact of life for
the hardworking band who have relentlessly crisscrossed their
native Canada and the States.<p>

"Superficially, we are similar... yes," allowed the urbane
bassist. "I have a very high voice, so does Robert Plant, but
it's an entirely different voice. Both bands play at a pretty
high volume, but the music is different. And when you look
inside at what motivates the music, you see it's very different."<p>

Geddy expounds on the Canadian identity which has produced a
synthesis of musical genres -- the rock and roll hybrid that
is Rush. Living in Canada, he explains, a rock musician will
share many cultural reference points with his American
counterparts. Thematic concerns like "driving around in your car" 
and high school proms are naturally foreign to Europeans. Rush 
enjoyed the best of both worlds.<p>

"In Canada, you're influenced by American things, but you
also absorb a great deal of the Commonwealth country's
British background," Geddy continues.<p>

Yet theirs is a debt common to all "Third Generation"
rockers. Whereas bands such as the Stones and Led Zeppelin
could transform rhythm and blues into a powerful new musical
mode, the bands of the 70's must incorporate the rock
heritage of their predecessors. And like their contemporaries
Kiss and Aerosmith, Rush reveals utmost respect for their
rock and roll roots, regardless of national origin.<p>

"Our influences are still around -- that makes it a bit
tougher We're still a young band... with us, we're still
competing with some of our very influences."<p>

It's easier to categorize new music in simple terms of what
is already familiar. Yet Rush is quite capable of functioning
in the face of such comparison. The band spent five grueling
years playing in tiny provincial bars where patrons had no
interest in a sneak preview of stardom." Mostly, they wanted
a living jukebox.<p>

"The worst was Northern Ontario," Geddy recalled, "They don't
care what you do. They don't care if you do the greatest
original material in the world if their ears haven't heard it
before. They just want to get drunk and hear their favorite
tunes."<p>

When so many weaker characters would simply hang up their
Flying V's, how did Rush survive the endless thankless
5 set nights that would barely pay for the equipment van's gasoline?<p>

"It was just persistence," said Geddy, "We only did tunes
that we liked, and we'd sneak in an original here and
there. Eventually, we built up our own little following."<p>

The determination and rugged individualism that developed so
early in the band's career were essential when Rush finally
took the leap into the recording studio. Their initial
offering was rejected by record companies. Undaunted, they
formed their own record label and released their first LP
independently.<p>

"We just kept ourselves going," Geddy remembered, "My family
didn't understand what I was doing... until I started
making money!"<p>

But the long climb to the top was not without casualties. One
who fell by the wayside was the band's original drummer, John
Rutsey.<p>

"Just before we were planning our first American tour,"
explained Geddy, "just before things really started
happening, it was obvious that his heart wasn't into it. So
we thought we'd better get it out in the open before things
really started coming at us fast. He just wasn't thinking the
way Alex and I were and he decided it would be better for
himself and for us if he left. And it turned out for the
best." Because, it was love at first sight for drummer Neil
Peart and the surviving 2/3 of Rush.<p>

"We had pretty definite ideas as to what we wanted," Geddy
recalls, "and as soon as Neil came in and sat behind his kit,
we just knew he was right. He was just doing things we'd
always wanted to hear behind our music. And right from the
beginning, he was very excited and took a very dominant
role."<p>

The debonair drummer also assumed responsibility for the
band's lyrics, an unusual contribution for the average
tub-thumper.<p>

"Neil is our man of words," says Geddy, "but he also
dismissed the notion that the remaining members of Rush are
just strong silent types.<p>

"The things I write about are real close to my heart," he
admitted, "and I can only write if I'm personally motivated
by something, whereas Neil is very literate and can just pull
things out of the air." Neil's fertile imagination was
invaluable in the creation of 2112, Rush's fourth, and
concept album (Mercury), that was a daring project for the
young band.<p>

The pressures of touring can also cause the wells of inspiration to
run dry, sometimes forcing a band to put out a live album for
lack of new material. That, however, was not the case with 
All The World's A Stage.  <p>

"We always wanted to do a live album as
a sort of historical thing," Geddy pointed out. "In fact, we wanted
to do it as our fourth album, but we thought it might be too early so
we did 2112 instead."<p>

One criticism leveled at All the World's a Stage is the feet
that its packaging, imitative of Kiss' incredibly successful
Kiss Alive format, features what almost amounts to an
advertisement for Rush's earlier LPs.<p>

"We didn't want it to look like that!" sighed Geddy, "It
wasn't supposed to look like a commercial. The record company
did that. I guess from a business point of view it made sense
but our original intention was to furnish a historical
package, a discography. We wanted people to be able to tell
where the songs came from."<p>

"The next album," Geddy reveals, "will be recorded in
England. It will be a natural progression, though not a major
concept like 2112. We've always looked up to the English
progressive bands and it's gonna be a good opportunity to go
over there and try to capture the same sort of atmosphere.
We're also expanding what we can play," he added "We're
getting into more instruments, there will be more texture. We
would never foresake our hard rock framework, though! We'll
just update it," the bassist states emphatically. "A lot of
bands underestimate their audience. But if you look at the
very big bands with longevity, they've grown and progressed
and their audiences have grown and progressed with them.
We're not looking for immediate results, we're hoping to be
around for years and years."<p>
