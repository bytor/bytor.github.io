<strong>Sound Quality:</strong> 7<br>

As is common with all the Counterparts boots that I've heard, this is 
lacking in sound. Bass? Are you sure Geddy played bass that night? Hm, don't 
seem to hear any...  The crowd is much louder than the band, and can be heard 
talking during parts of the songs. You can't hear what they're saying, except 
for the yelling. You also can't hear what Alex is saying on stage! However, 
this does sound like it was actually recorded in the same room as
Rush was playing, just a very large room.<p>

The pictures they used in the booklet are wonderful, too bad they're wasted in
such a poor-sounding recording. And too bad they're from the previous tour.
The indexing is slighly off, track 7 ("Nobody's Hero") actually begins in the
middle of the previous song.<p>

As seems to be the fad these days, this boot does not just contain one show.
Perhaps to make up for the lack of sound quality, part of a second show has
been added at the end of disc 2. However, they are not from the "Cornhusker
Arena" as the cd states -- there is no such place. Instead, they are from the
Civic Arena in Omaha. The sound on this is odd; it sounds distorted, and very
non-stereo, yet sounds almost like it came from the soundboard; there is 
little crowd noise except between songs. It's also easy to tell that these
songs were spliced together and NOT in the true song order. The best way
to describe it is "hollow".<p>

It's possible that this is a many-generation copy of the original soundboard,
as Rush did tape all of the Hold Your Fire tour for the live album A Show of
Hands.<p>

Overall this isn't a bad boot, <strong>much</strong> better than Northern
Heroes, but lacking overall. The songs from Omaha almost make this CD
worthwhile.  Get this one on tape if you get it at all. Or better yet, track
down a low-gen copy of the Omaha show and forget about the Counterparts one!<p>
