You just don't get it<br>
What it is ... well, you're not really sure<br>
Your patient's head is held in a big vice<br>
The patient's very secure<p>

Veins in a spiral --  hard to observe<br>
I know you get dizzy, but try not to cut that nerve<br>
With the sharp scalpel you make a wrong thrust<br>
Waiting for rescue, and I know that you just<br>
Don't get it<br>
You just don't get it<p>

Neurology -- Biology<br>
It's just Oncology -- Histology<br>
It's just Pathology -- Serology<br>
It's just Biology -- Neurology<p>

You just don't get it<br>
The patient is about to die<br>
You won't get a paycheck -- forget it<br>
The hospital is asking why<p>

Heartbeat is random -- the pulse takes a dip<br>
The knife sure is slippery but try not to lose your grip<br>
With the sharp scalpel another wrong thrust<br>
Blood gushing out, and I know that you just<br>
Can't stop it<br>
You just can't stop it<p>

BEEP!<br>
Blood pressure fell, this one won't get well<br>
He will not be in debt to you<br>
BEEP!<br>
Sweat running cold, relatives must be told<br>
They're a personal threat to you<br>
BEEP!<br>
Another one dead from a blow to the head<br>
But don't let it get to you<br>
BEEP!<p>
</body>
