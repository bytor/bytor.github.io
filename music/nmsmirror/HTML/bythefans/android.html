	I'm writing this author's note because a) it will give you an insight
to the inner workings of the story and b) author's notes are cool.  If
author's notes piss you off, feel free to page down to: The Story <p>

	This is a story I wrote in my creative writing class Senior year in
high school.  It is one of the only ones that I don't feel like a complete
jackass about.  Keyword complete.  So what does this have to do with
Rush?  The inspiration for this story came from The Body Electric (Grace Under
Pressure).  I had just bought Grace and was really into the song, (This was
early 1995, so don't go thinking this was 100 years ago, unless of course
you're reading this 100 years from now... But enough of that, back to the
Note) and so when Short Story Time came, I decided that the ideas in the song
would make a cool story, so I took those ideas, combined them with some of the
ideas in Blade Runner (which I had recently seen as part of a Sci Fi course,
which was way cooler than Creative Writing) and Presto! (tee hee) Android was
born.<p>
	This is an attempt at an original work, as best a 17 year old could
manage.  So please don't email me saying, "The Body Electric is based on THX
1138 and that's not what that movie was about" or "Hey, that's not what
happened in Blade Runner".  I know. This is my story.  Also, don't email me
telling me how unoriginal this is; you'd wreck my already low self esteem,
sending me into therapy, which I would charge to insurance, which would charge
the government, which would find some way to charge you, so it's best if you
don't.  You may, however, tell me how wonderful you think I am.  Any big
publisher types feel free to send me large sums of money.  Anyone else who
wants to send me large sums of money may do so as well.  I'm always interested 
in large sums of money.  But enough of that.  On with: The Story

It had never happened before.  One of the XR-28A androids had escaped.
Randall Decker looked at the report.  At 0700 hours March  5, 2251, XR-28A:
342789 had walked out of the radium mine, attacked two guards and fled.  It
didn't make sense.  Androids had broken down, stopped functioning, or even
gone berserk and started attacking things and people at random.  But never
before had any android shown a clear desire to do anything other than what it
was programmed to do.<p>

	"Decker!"  Randall looked up from his report with a start.  Captain
Jameson's face had appeared on the vidphone, and it was not pleasant.  "Good,
you have the report in front of you.  I'm assigning top priority to this case.
As you know, this has never happened before, so I don't exactly know how to
handle it.  But, since two humans were killed in the incident, I decided to
give it over to the homicide department and make you handle it."<p>

	"Thanks a lot, Capt'n." came the reply, less than enthusiastic.  "This
doesn't have anything to do with that artificial snake in your locker last
Thursday, does it?"<p>

	"That was <em>you</em> ?"<p>

	"I didn't say that,"   Randall shifted uneasily in his seat.  "Is
there any new information on the droid?"<p>

	"Nah, All I've been hearing from the brass is how this has never
happened before.  The droid was last seen in the Mojave desert, probably
hiding out in some of the abandoned mines.  Other than that, nothing really
useful."<p>

	"Any word on how this happened?"<p>

	"Well, nothing conclusive, but there are some theories.  The XR-28A
androids were designed to be able to react to a variety of problems in the
mines.  In order to accomplish that, the designers worked at giving them the
ability to reason, learn and otherwise function on their own.  Some of the
boys working on it think that the level of complexity allowed the droid to
develop a sense of self and maybe even some base emotions.  I personally think
it's all a bunch of pigeon crap, but it's the best explanation I've got so
far."<p>

	"OK Capt'n, I'm on it."<p>

	"Well?"<p>

	"Well what?"<p>

	"Why are you still here?"<p>

	With a dirty look and a grumble Randall got up from his seat and
headed for the door.  Outside his office he checked out his gun and filled out
a release for the hovercar.  Grumbling about androids, paperwork and life in
general, Randall headed off on the case.<p>

	XR-28A:342789 slept.   It normally did not need to sleep more than
once every two weeks, when it returned to the Central Computer for
regeneration.  But it was running nights, and it reasoned that while it was
hiding in the day, and in the absence of the Central computer, it was wise to
conserve energy.  And while it slept it did another thing that was out of the
ordinary.  It dreamt.  At first, it was just random information, but then a
shape appeared among the ones and zeros.  A flower, a single red rose, was
blooming.  And when it bloomed, it saw itself in the middle, holding a golden
key, and it was inserting the key into its head as if to unlock it.   However,
the key was jammed, try as it might, it couldn't get the key to unlock its
mind.<p>

	It awoke with a start.  It looked around, trying to process the
sensory data and remember where it was.  A cave, it was hiding here from the
Makers.   The entrance was about twenty meters away, the red light of the
sunset streamed in to illuminate the cave.  It was resting in a niche in the
wall, hiding itself from view.  The only sounds were an occasional drip of
water or a bat awakening to feed.  It experienced an odd sensation, for the
first time it actually felt being alone. <p>

	Once it was sure of its surroundings, its thoughts returned to the
dream.  What did it mean?  Analysis - negative.  Re-analysis - negative.  It
struggled to understand.  Level two diagnostic - all systems normal.  Level
one - all systems normal.  It was growing impatient and frustrated, and it was
unable to deal with these new feelings, which just caused more frustration.
As it was fighting to understand itself, a sound, perhaps a rock striking
another, caught its attention.  It looked up and experienced two new emotions.
Terror and panic.<p>

	
	Randall was probably just as surprised as the android, if not more.
He had been all over the Mojave, hoping to use the radiation signature from
the mines to locate the droid.  After a dozen false leads he found this cave,
and was in the process of leaving when he found - stumbled upon is probably
more accurate - the android.  He saw the dimly outlined shape of a young man,
but his instruments saw an artificial life form.  Damn the Mining Commission,
it's not like they need to make them look human.<p>

	The android ran.  Bolted right out of its hiding place and deeper into
the cave.  Randall moved to follow, first taking his nightvision glasses out
of his utility belt and putting them on.  The cave lit up bright as day.
Holding his gun in front of him, Randall moved cautiously forward into the
cavern.  Even with all his toys the droid still had the advantage. <p>

	Hearing the faint crack of stone against stone he turned and fired.
The beam lashed forth and struck the far wall, sending the android scrambling
out of its new hiding place and further down a narrow corridor.  Randall
followed for a few meters but then quickly lost sight of the droid.  Even in
unfamiliar territory the android had a clear advantage in speed and
maneuverability, sensing obstacles many times faster than any mere human brain
could ever hope to do.   Randall stopped and went for his belt, retrieving the
hand held radiation detector similar to the one in the hovercar he had used to
locate the android in the first place.  Patching the information through to
his glasses, he now had a visual display of the surrounding radiation output.<p>

	Randall started moving again, letting the numbers guide him through
the twists and turns of the cave.   <em>This is probably how the android does it
too</em> .   The thought startled Randall, but this was no time for philosophical
debate.  He kept moving, stopping every so often to get a bearing on the
radiation signature.  <p>

	Eventually he wound up in a large cavern.  The radiation signature
suggested that the android was in here, but it did not give an exact location.
 He moved carefully, trying to detect without being detected.   A noise behind
him startled him, and he spun and fired.  The beam struck solid rock, and out
of the corner of his eye he saw the android pick up a large rock.  Dropping
his gun, Randall ducked and rolled as the rock sailed over his head.
Scrambling back to his feet, Randall went for his gun.  Ducking another rock,
Randall tripped over a rock formation jutting out of the floor.  Before he
could get up, the android was standing over him, holding a rock high above its
head.<p>

	This was the first really good look Randall had of the android.  It
had a very human figure, with a lean muscular build, pale skin, short  blond
hair and blue eyes.  It had a twisted expression on its face.  <em>Fear?  
Agony?</em> thought Randall.  <em>This is a fine time to be studying the 
emotional responses of an android, waiting to die like this.</em>  <p>

	The rock still held its position above the android's head.  The
android stared at Randall for a few seconds, studying him.  <em>The same 
thing I'm doing to it</em> .   The thought fascinated Randall, and all thoughts 
of dying fled from his mind.  Slowly, the android lowered the rock.  
In a weak voice, it asked, "Why?"<p>

	"You're asking me?" replied Randall, "Hey, look, I just came to bring
you back to the mines.  If you . . . "<p>

	"No!!" it screamed. "You can't take me back, not until I know why!
Why? Why?!"<p>

	It grasped its head as if in intolerable pain.  It stood there,
struggling with itself for what seemed like an eternity.  Then, finally, it
stiffened, its eyes glazed over, and it collapsed.<p>

	Randall stared for a long while.  He felt somehow empty inside.  <em>Get
over it, its only a machine</em> .  These words repeated themselves over and 
over in Randall's mind, but he could not make himself believe them.  <p>

	Captain Jameson's face had a relieved look on it that was clearly
broadcast over the hovercar's vidphone.  "Good work, Decker.  That android had
us all scared."<p>

	"Had you  scared!" exclaimed Randall, "That thing nearly killed me!"<p>

	"Well you can change your shorts later.  Right now I need you to get
that android to the Mining Commission's Research and Development lab in
Ontario."<p>

	Randall looked over his shoulder at the collapsed android he had
somehow managed to get into the back seat.  The android was much heavier than
it looked.  Although he was fairly sure that there would be no trouble, he
activated the security field anyway, just to be safe.  The hovercar lifted off
the ground from its place in front of the cave and headed toward its
destination.<p>

	"You looked beat, Rand, are you going to be OK?" Jameson said as
Randall was cruising up to speed.<p>

	"Yeah, I'm OK," Randall sighed.  "It's just, well, that android seemed
so real.  But it's just a machine, isn't it?"<p>

	"You're asking the wrong guy.  You're the one going to the Mining
Commission, ask them.  As for you, you've had a hard day.  Take the rest of
the week off.  Go on vacation.  I hear it's police officer's week at the
Epsilon Resort on the Martian Settlement.  Fifty percent discount."<p>

	"But..."<p>

	"That's an order.  Besides, you've always wanted to go to Mars.
Vacation starts as soon as you get back from Ontario."<p>

	The hovercar
slid through the early evening sky and landed on the hoverpad at the Earth
Mining Commission Research and Development Laboratories, North American
Division.  Several people in white lab coats were waiting for the arrival.
The leader, Dr. Sandra Josephson, greeted Randall as he got out of the car.<p>

	"Detective Decker, I can't express how much this means to us.  This
has never happened before."<p>

	"So I hear."  Several men with special equipment were waiting around
the back of the hovercar.  "Oh, sorry."  Randall reached in the front of the
hovercar and deactivated the security field and opened the back doors.  At
once the men reached in and pulled the android out of the car.  Soon they were
carrying him off into the building and down the dark corridors of the
laboratory.<p>

	"How did you stop it?" asked Dr. Josephson.<p>

	"I didn't.  I think it had a nervous breakdown."<p>

	"Well, that is certainly unusual."<p>

	"It kept asking why, at the end, right before it broke down."<p>

	"Why what?"<p>

	"I don't know."  Randall shifted uncomfortably.  "Do you think that it
could, you know, really <em>feel</em> anything.  Emotions I mean.  It even 
referred to itself as 'me'."<p>

	"Well, we hope to find out.  Right now the android is being plugged
into our central computer for study and reprogramming.  I doubt a machine
could have real human emotions, and as for it referring to itself as an
individual, well, I just don't know.  Did you have any other questions?"<p>

	"Yeah.  What do you know about the Epsilon Resort on the Martian
Settlement?"<p>

	XR-28A: 342789 had been plugged into the Central Computer, and
its limp body lay unmoving in the capsule as it joined the collective android
intelligence.  The Central Computer made the routine diagnostics,
systematically searching all the systems looking for any sign of damage which
it would then repair.  It had already completed body diagnostics and was now
searching the neural networking of the brain.<p>
	Down, deep down in the Central Computer, down in a place not even the
programmers knew about, among the ones and zeros, there was a spark.  Then an
abstract image, the image of a single red rose floating among the data.<p>
