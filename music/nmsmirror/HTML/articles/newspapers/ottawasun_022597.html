<font size=+1>Geddy up for top honor</font><br>
<b>by Paul Cantin</b><p>

Nobody gets into rock 'n' roll to get the Order Of Canada, but now that the
honor is about to be bestowed upon Rush, Geddy Lee is happy to accept. <p>

"I think it is really cool. I'm really honored to be given a medal by my
country," says bassist-singer Lee, who will join drummer Neil Peart and
guitarist Alex Lifeson tomorrow at Rideau Hall, honored alongside actor Al
Waxman, comedian Frank Shuster and a host of unsung Canadians in
receiving our highest civilian award.<p>

"I've never had a medal, and I'm sure it will look nice at the breakfast table
every morning," says Lee, father of a 16-year-old boy and a two-year-old
girl. "It will be a great source of getting more respect out of my children.<p>

"Sir Geddy would be good," he adds with a laugh.<p>

Considering their many achievements, it's a surprise that it has taken so
long for the trio to get recognized.<p>

"Oddly enough, throughout the world, we are kind of considered slightly
more underground," says Lee.<p>

"But in our own home country, we are treated more as a mainstream,
established group. As a result, we do get taken for granted from time to
time. But it comes with the territory. I can't say I harbor any weird
feelings."<p>

The temptation of warmer weather and lower taxes could have lured them
elsewhere, but the decision to stay in Toronto was a deliberate one. <p>

"There is a nice sense of giving a damn about certain social programs that
don't exist in other countries. Although our present government in Ontario is
trying hard to cut them all out, I think there is an outcry and people are
concerned about the kind of community they have here," he says.<p>

"Although I am not a socialist, I do favor supporting certain programs that
benefit our society. Things like childcare and so forth. How do you help
people help themselves? That's an attitude that does exist in this country and
I'm proud of that."<p>

Rush maintains a devoted following but continues to attract new, young
fans, and enjoys a healthy respect in underground rock circles. Pavement
even name-checks Lee on their new record (he hasn't heard it), but Lee says
respect comes from not dwelling on the past.<p>

"All these bands coming back with great revival tours, I don't want to go
through that. I want to make new music and experiment within ... a little
niche for ourselves."<p>

Despite their focus on the future, the band is preparing to reissue its early
albums with upgraded sound and restored artwork. There's also what Lee
calls a "plethora" of live material awaiting release and discussions about a
follow-up to their recent Test For Echo LP. But for now, Rush is focused
on its ongoing tour, which should touch down in Canada by summer. He
won't comment on rumors the group could open the Canadian leg in Ottawa
on Canada Day and he pours cold water on bothersome suggestions about
the band's future, including whispers that Peart has been suffering health
problems.<p>

"There have been times where there was the feeling of giving it a rest. But
considering the length of time we have been together, they have been
remarkably few," he says.<p>

But back to titles. Lee jokingly wonders if, in 20 years, Rush could be
promoted within the Order Of Canada, from "officer" to the loftier title of
"companion."<p>

"I think Prime Minister of the Order of Canada would be nice."<p>

Or just Prime Minister Geddy?<p>

"I don't think I'd get enough votes from all the special interest groups." <p>
