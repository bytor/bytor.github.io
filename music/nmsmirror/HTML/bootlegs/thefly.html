The Fly was the first cd boot out of the Roll The Bones tour, which is the
only reason I bought it. Had I had a choice, I most certainly would've passed
this one by. Not only is it only half the concert, but the sound leaves a lot
to be desired.<p>

For the most part, the sound is very distant for both band and audience. The
bass blends in too much with the rest of the music, and the drums are very
muddled. Almost like it was being recorded from inside someone's jacket.<p>

The front of the booklet has a fly; not sure what that has to do with Rush,
perhaps they thought they were doing one for U2 (at that time the word "fly"
was big for boots of the Zoo TV tour). The packaging is nicely done in blue,
which even included in mine a translucent blue cd tray (although most of the
prongs have since broke off) but has little to do with Rush. The majority of
it has blue flowers, with three pictures of the band (which aren't too great
either).<p>

Skip this one, there are better RTB cd boots out there. Your ears and wallet 
will thank you.<p>
