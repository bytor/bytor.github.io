<font size=+1>Rush concert provides fans few surprises, but all the familiar
pleasures</font><br>
<b>by Michael Saunders</b><p>

Rush is all about zits and breaking curfew and getting to third base in the back
of a gas-guzzling American muscle car. After two decades together the band is
still the musical essence of being 17.<p>

Rush's 20-odd years of touring have laid an unshakable foundation of fan
support, a deep reverence displayed over the years at countless arenas like
the Worcester Centrum. Outside the arena, 22 limousines snaked along a side
street, hired by fans who wanted to "do it up right," as a 17-year-old might
say. There may be Budweiser in the wet bar, but there's nothing like a long
white Lincoln to convey the appearance of partying in style.<p>

This was the kind of show fans looked forward to for months. It was textbook
arena rock: an extravagant light show, startling special effects, middling
music. Yes, middling. Geddy Lee, despite the many disciples gathered Friday
night, is not God.<p>

Rush has always been a fan's band, meaning critics usually pan the unvarying
power rock, the monochromatic rhythmic groove, or the English Lit lite lyrics.
When have critics or parents or any voices of authority mattered when you're
17? Or when you wanted to remember how it felt to be 17?<p>

Rush's peers were in the audience Friday night, the congregation packed into
the hall for a musical communion. Fans unfailingly sang along with each song,
adding a campfire feel of togetherness.<p>

The show was a technical gem. The light display was exceptional, the colors
vibrant.<p>

Most songs were bracketed by brief video segments that gave the show
continuity. Random icons and computer graphics flashed across a theater-sized
move screen. A rapping skeleton danced alive during "Throw the Bones," and
live flame jets and fireworks brought collective gasps.<p>

Musically, Rush was Rush: full-tilt power rock, no prancing, no stupid fake
head banging. The trio served up a blend of new and old songs scattered
throughout a two-hour set.<p>

Pocket lighters flickered like sacred luminaries during "Nobody's Hero," a
surprisingly substantial and bittersweet song that packaged a lot of emotion
in not much time.<p>

As the show rolled into its classic rock phase, the crowd torqued up its
energy. It was all in the cards from the beginning, because this was a display
of basics at its best, sound, light, spectacle managed by seasoned pros. The
band knows just how to manipulate an audience, teaking all the right buttons,
calling up the Pavlovian answers to all the old questions: Worcester,
Massachusetts, how are you tonight? (Bring up house lights, cue roaring
crowd.)<p>
