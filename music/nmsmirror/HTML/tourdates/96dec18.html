Old favorites give fans the classic Rush 
</font><br>
<strong>By Ira Band</strong> - Special to The Star <p>

Well, the long-awaited Rush concert, rumored to be held in December, actually 
did take place here last night.<p>

Now, before you Rush fans develop heart failure, please be aware the show did 
not take place at Maple Leaf Gardens or SkyDome's skybowl, two venues the band 
could certainly fill. <p>

Instead, the trio appeared at the 900-capacity Phoenix Concert Theatre, an odd 
choice for a band that has probably been Canada's most consistently popular 
and successful rock export of the last 20-plus years.<p>

Yet, this wasn't just another Rush show. Rather, it was the 10th installment 
of the Molson Canadian Rocks Blind Date Tour, a cross-country marketing 
campaign bringing hundreds of lucky contest winners into relatively intimate 
contact with bands that typically play in cavernous hockey arenas or baseball 
stadiums. So far this year, Toronto winners have been in the company of such 
acts as Metallica and The Sex Pistols.<p>

But what kind of "blind date" can it be when so many in the crowd seem to know 
who's going to appear?<p>

One of the oddest moments of Rush's performance last night was the general 
lack of enthusiasm and excitement from the crowd when the Toronto band first 
stepped onstage. Where was the surprise, the thrill?<p>

"Oh, everyone here knew it was going to be Rush," said one non-plussed patron 
after the band had finished its second song, the appropriately titled 
"Big Money."<p>

Oh, really? Aren't these Blind Date shows supposed to be more top-secret than 
federal budgets? "I think it was just a lucky guess on the part of some 
people," said one Molson spokesperson, when advised of the highly accurate 
gossip going on well before the show.<p>

Whatever. If the audience wasn't particularly aroused during the first few 
songs, a more spirited feeling evolved over the course of the evening.<p>

Credit the band for this turnaround. Often hit and miss in concert, Rush was, 
for the most part, in fine form for much of the night.<p>

Guitarist Alex Lifeson, drummer Neil Peart and singer/bassist/keyboardist 
Geddy Lee offered tight, note-perfect deliveries of such songs as 
"Subdivisions," "Roll The Bones" and "Nobody's Hero," transferring their big, 
stadium sound surprisingly well to the club venue. Little wonder, since The 
Phoenix was stacked with more speakers and hi-tech soundboards than are 
traditionally seen at this club.<p>

Similarly strong was the lighting, which was bright and frequently dramatic. 
The band put it all to good use on many of the songs showcased from the new 
album, Test For Echo, including "Driven," "Half The World" and "Virtuality."<p>

As expected, while the crowd provided a polite enough response for the new 
material, it was older, classic Rush tunes that generated the biggest and 
brightest spark of the evening. Nine songs into the concert, the trio offered 
a terrific take on "Closer To The Heart." From there, the show truly took 
off.<p>

Intimate venue is a real Rush</font><br>
<strong>by Jane Stevenson</strong>, Toronto Sun<p>

What a Rush!<p>

That would be bassist-keyboardist-vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson 
and drummer Neil Peart.<p>

The trio of musical virtuosos who make up the veteran Canadian band Rush gave 
800 people at the Pheonix on Wednesday night a scaled-down but powerful sneak 
preview of their current road show that's expected to pull into the Gardens 
in the spring.<p>

The group has been touring the U.S. since October, where they have sold 
500,000 copies of their latest album, Test for Echo. (It's almost reached 
platinum status in Canada).<p>

"Hello Canadians!" welcomed Lee after the band whipped through Dreamline and 
The Big Money. "It's lovely to see you here. How are you doing? It's nice to 
be in such intimate surroundings for a change. I can see each and every one of 
you." Rush normally trot out the large video screen and laser light show to 
enhance their extremely loud but dynamic prog-rock sound in a stadium setting.  
But Wednesday night's event was another "blind date" show, in which contest 
winners arrive to see "a big band at a small venue" supposedly without knowing 
whom they are going to see.<p>

Previous groups in Toronto have included Metallica and the Sex Pistols, but 
Molson Canadian's final promotion of the year is different in that the same 50 
people are travelling across the country to see three shows in a row. It began 
Monday night in St. John's, Nfld., with Sheryl Crow, and wraps up Dec. 29 in 
Vancouver.<p>

For their part, Rush often seemed more excited than the crowd to be performing 
in such a small space, decorating the stage with a life-size cutout of 
soon-to-be-ex Baywatch babe Pamela Anderson Lee.<p>

"This is kind of fun," said the sunglasses-wearing Lee, who jumped around like 
a kangaroo all night long. "Getting sweaty up here and all that stuff".  The 
black leather pants-clad Lifeson, meanwhile, played the clown, striking rock 
star poses, making goofy faces and occasionally meeting Lee at the front of 
the stage to play side-by-side.  The usually serious Peart cracked a smile at 
one point, but otherwise remained hunched over his enormous kit, wowing the 
audience every time he threw a drum stick high up into the air and caught it.<p>

The band's 19-song set included five new songs from Test for Echo, most notably 
their latest hit, Half The World.<p>

But the crowd seemed more interested in Rush classics Closer To The Heart, 
Subdivisions, The Spirit Of Radio and Tom Sawyer. (Hey, even I had a few high 
school flashbacks during Lee's high-pitched vocals.)<p>

This is a group who perform the musical equivalent of finishing each other's 
sentences with finesse.  They appear to have never been fresher.<p>

Rush makes a fine blind date in Toronto
</font><br>
<strong>By JOHN POWELL</strong> Jam! Showbiz<p>

No fog machines. No video screens. No fireworks screams. No laser beams. No
floppy-eared bouncing Presto bunnies either.  Tonight's Blind Date
show at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto was a Rush fan's
testimonial. Stripped of all the appealing high-tech sensory theatrics that are
the band's calling cards, what lingered were three guys on a stage playing
their guts out and enjoying every minute of it. Like slapping a CD on your
player and slipping the headphones on,the distractions disappeared.
The music and emotion coming in loud and clear.<p>

"We're gonna play a whole bunch of absurd music for you tonight,"
said bass player Geddy Lee in his best English accent. And he
wasn't joshin'. The 19-song set was a diverse sampling of Rush's
20 album magical mystery tour which pleased the loyal devotee as
well as the enthusiastic newcomer.<p>

Tacking a surfin' safari jam onto Big Money was a small hint of the
carefree levity in store. Currently on a North American tour (to
promote their new disk Test For Echo), the dates are crammed with
large stadium shows. Rush, which hasn't played an intimate venue
since they dumped that church basement gig approximately 27 years
ago, were basking in the atmosphere. Lead guitar god and clown
school graduate, Alex Lifeson, was zanier than ever, making faces at
Lee behind his back, kidding with the fans and striking your typical
"I am a guitar God" poses throughout the show. Lee dabbled in
foreign accents and dueled Lifeson. Hell, even Neil Peart whose
masterful concentration while bashing the skins couldn't be diverted
even if a squad of giggling cheerleaders pranced across the stage,
cracked a fleeting smile. Will miracles never cease?<p>

The hometown boys even sprung for a cardboard cutout of Pamela
Anderson Lee holding a plastic cup (for spare change?). Hint. Hint.
Nudge. Nudge. Wink. Wink.<p>

The air drums were out in full force during Red barchetta, Animate
and Subdivisions but were packed up as the audience loudly gabbed
during the slower tunes Nobody's Hero and Virtuality. Roll The
Bones, The Spirit Of Radio, Closer To The Heart and Tom Sawyer
had the crowd singing along.<p>

The trio onstage tonight wasn't the Rush of 1996, or even 1986 for
that matter. They were once again the wild-eyed young 'un's
prowling the club circuit pocketing just enough dough to buy that
new amplifier. Stealing a swig from the fountain of youth, Lee was
hitting those high notes again. Peart taught those drums a lesson or
two but spared them the renowned solo. Lifeson strummed those
strings as if the group was still opening for The New York Dolls.<p>

It has been said that Rush is closer to the end of their career than the
beginning. Flush the Geritol and toss the Depends. They won't be
needing them quite yet, thank you very much. In Lakeside Park the
grass is still green.<p>
