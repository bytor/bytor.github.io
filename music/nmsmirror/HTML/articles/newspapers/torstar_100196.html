<font size=+2>The Toronto Star<br>
October 1, 1996</font><p>

<font size=+1>Power trio in no rush to end it all</font><br>
<b>by Peter Howell</b><p>

Lord knows, there are many rock bands that should be doing some
soul-searching about their reasons for continued existence.<p>

This past summer's concert season resembled a zombie stampede from
Night Of The Living Dead, as amphitheatres echoed to the warmed-over
sounds of acts from the 1960s and '70s - and the cold echo of many
empty seats.<p>

Come on down, Styx, Jethro Tull, ELP, Deep Purple . . . or better yet,
don't come on down.<p>

How ironic, then, that the one veteran band with the strongest
arguments against retirement, the Toronto power trio Rush, has been
the only one to seriously question its own validity in the late '90s.<p>

The question is implicit in the title of Rush's new album, Test For
Echo, the 21st release by the 22-year-old musical partnership.<p>

Written out of a collective dread of "Is there anybody out there?"
the Rush team of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart have already
had their answer back, loud and clear.<p>

The album recently debuted at No. 5 on the trend-setting Billboard
chart, ahead of '90s rock giant Pearl Jam. It was the third time since
the introduction of the SoundScan sales-tracking technology in 1991
that a new Rush album has debuted in Billboard's Top 5, a feat
unmatched by any other Canadian artist.<p>

The album title song quickly became the No. 1 rock track in the U.S.,
based on the number of radio spins nationally. It knocked aside
another new rock power, Soundgarden. In Canada, Test For Echo shipped
gold, 50,000 units, and it is actually moving those units.<p>

The band remains a potent live draw throughout North America. It can
sell out both Maple Leaf Gardens (a concert there is pencilled in for
mid-December) and New York's Madison Square Garden.<p>

The large number of Rush sites on the Internet is another testament to
the enduring appeal of the band.<p>

And yet, when band founders Lee and Lifeson got together last October
to begin the Test For Echo sessions, after an 18-month break, their
longest ever, they did nothing at first except talk about Rush's place
in the cosmos.<p>

"We've been doing it a long time, and I think you have to question
why you're doing it," singer/bassist Lee, 43, said recently, during a
relaxed interview in the Rush management office in downtown Toronto.<p>

"Have we gotten so professional that we know we could put together a
record without really having our hearts in it? Is our music still
connecting with people?<p>

"The time off that we had, and three years between records, saw a lot
of changes in the music industry. There's so many different veins of
rock and so many different bands. I listen to radio and I wonder,
'Where do we fit into this picture?' "<p>

Lee had been asking himself these questions despite being "raring to
go" after many happy months spent as a new dad. He and his wife added
a daughter to the Lee brood, which also includes a 16-year-old son.<p>

Guitarist Lifeson, also 43, had been asking himself even more serious
questions. Before Rush reconvened last fall, he'd been working on his
first solo album, Victor, which was released earlier this year. It
gave him a chance to be the boss, which he'd never been with Rush, and
he was wondering if he wanted to submit himself to higher authorities
once again.<p>

Lifeson was also "really unsettled" about Rush's previous album,
1993's Counterparts, a record that sold well but which he admits now
wasn't a career peak: "Just about every song could have been better
than it was."<p>

He and Lee spent the first four days together talking about the future
of Rush, as they watched the autumn colors outside a rural studio
retreat north of Toronto. As is his wont, drummer/lyricist Peart, 44,
waited to join them, since he prefers to work mostly alone.<p>

"We spent a lot of time just sitting outside, just drinking coffee
and talking about where we wanted to go as people," Lifeson recalled,
in a separate interview.<p>

"Our conversations were really broad, and we were a little concerned
we weren't getting back into it as enthusiastically as we expected
to."<p>

Added Lee: "It was like dogs sniffing each other, just finding our
territory, finding what we had in common."<p>

The talking worked. Lee discovered that Lifeson wanted a greater hand
in song arranging and album production, tasks that mostly had been
left up to Lee in the strictly defined Rush hierarchy. The experience
with Victor had given Lifeson greater confidence with his playing and
his musical sense.<p>

And Lifeson realized that Lee was happy to let go of the reins a bit.
Lee was enjoying life as a family man once again, working as if he had
a daytime job, and he wasn't eager to get back into all-night
sessions, something Lifeson's grown-up family allowed him to do.<p>

"I think it was a slight maturing on my part," Lee said. "I was
happy just to be working. When you're faced with the fact that maybe
you're not going to be making any more records, that maybe the thing
is over, you appreciate the fact of actually making a record.<p>

"I was just less freaked out about things. Alex' work on Victor
convinced me he needs to feel the responsibility of doing certain
areas of production on his own. And that was great; it took a load off
my mind."<p>

Peart had been doing his own personal echo test. He's considered by
many to be one of the best rock drummers, if not the best, yet he
prepared for Test For Echo by taking drum lessons, seeking new zing in
his swing.<p>

He responded to the renewed vigor of Lee and Lifeson by penning some
of his best lyrics, particularly for the song "Resist": You can
surrender without a prayer/But never really pray without surrender.<p>

Test For Echo's strength in unity is earning it comparisons by many
Rush-watchers as the band's best since the landmark Moving Pictures of
1981.<p>

Reason enough for the band members to keep on keeping on - they're
already talking about the next album - and to keep reminding
themselves that they got into rock to have fun. It's not supposed to
feel like work.<p>

"It's usually the sense of humor that starts putting us together,"
Lee said. "We start cracking jokes, and before you know it, we're
just spending time together.<p>

"And that's a wonderful thing. I think it's really the thing that's
kept us a band for so many years. When you eliminate everyone else
from the picture, it's just the three of us sitting around.<p>

"It's really a nice partnership."<p>
