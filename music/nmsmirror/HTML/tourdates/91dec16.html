<h3>That was some Rush!</h3>
<p>
<h4>by Peter Howell</h4><p>

<strong>Why were we there?</strong><p>
Because Rush and Tragically Hip were there.<p>
<strong>Why did it happen?</strong><p>
Because we wanted it to happen.<p>

Roll the bones.. and eat alfalfa sprouts, you Rolling Stones.<p>

Two gyrating giant bunnies and a laser show capable of knocking out a fleet of
Klingons made the Rush headliner last night at Maple Leaf Gardens a better
visual event than the Stones' giant inflatable Ruby Tuesday doll, in my
book.<p>

And the comparison to rock's oldest living money machine is valid. Let's
remember that, as with the Stones, Rush also has an immense catalogue of great
songs, as well as history stretching back so far -- between 17 and 23 years,
depending on who's counting -- that people make dinosaur jokes.<p>

Sure, the Toronto power trio of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart were
around long before punk rocked and disco sucked. And they've reinvented
themselves many times, changing from metalheads to sci-fi gloomsters to
sultans of synth to their current incarnation as pop craftsmen.<p>

But Rush is always great live, and as the medley of "Dreamline", "Bravado" and
the title track off new album Roll The Bones proved last night to a sold-out
hometown crowd of 12,500, the band just keeps getting better.<p>

They got a standing "O" just for showing up, after show opener the Tragically
Hip got its own ovation for one of the year's better warm-ups.<p>

If there was any question whether the Hip is ready for stadium-sized shows,
the 40-minute set by Gord Downie and the rest of his Kingston crew put that to
rest. Wait until they add lasers, lights and video to dramatize the weird
goings-on in Downie's head, during songs like "New Orleans Is Sinking".<p>

As good as the Hip was, Rush was "Closer To The Heart" of the faithful, as
evidenced by the forest of Bics flicking during that standard.<p>

There were lots of other things to delight the gang, including the tunes
"Limelight" and "Tom Sawyer" from the big Moving Pictures album and "Show
Don't Tell", "The Pass" and "Supercondutor" from Presto. On "Time Stand
Still", from Hold Your Fire, singer Aimee Man from 'Til Tuesday appeared via
video to recreate her backing vocals.<p>

Singer/bassist Lee was in fine form, guitarist/synth wiz Lifeson never failed
and drummer Peart received a well-deserved roar for his inventive 10-minute
solo, which used a variety of drums and percussion and a synched-in sound and
light display that made use of the entire Gardens. Beauty, eh?<p>

Rush and the Hip both deserve kudos for earmarking a portion of the show's
take to the United Way and in encouraging fans to bring more than 15,000 lbs.
in donated food to the show, for Toronto's Daily Bread food bank.<p>

But it was those giant bunnies, frugging away to Lee's thumping bass as
"Superconductor" grooved into "Tom Sawyer", that really made the evening.<p>

Roll the bones, you Rush guys, and give those rabbits another helping of
alfalfa. They deserve it.<p>
