by Arthur Treacher<br>
<em>November 11, 1993</em>
<p>

I felt strong desire for some hops and barley<br>
So I went out to parties as a nerd minority<br>
It never seemed a threat to my mediocrity<br>
It only introduced me to the greatest of stupidity<p>

As the hours went by, I drank quite a lot<br>
When they saw their beer was gone<br>
They threw me in the parking lot<br>
Hey, that's somebody's --<p>

Beer! OH! -- Put it down you geek<br>
Go back to the library<br>
Beer, OH! -- Take your calculator<br>
Go do some chemistry<p>

Beer, OH! -- Here's a can of Cutter<br>
Pretend its beer you fool<br>
Beer, OH! -- You won't get a girl<br>
Doing so well in school<br>
You better get your hands off<br>
SOMEBODY'S BEER! OH!<p>

I didn't have a car, so I stole my roommates keys<br>
I drove to the frat house<br>
on the night of the big rush party<br>
They tried to carry on, tried to bear the sight of me<br>
They tried to ignore me<br>
like some sad case of charity<p>

As the hours went by, I drank quite a lot<br>
When they saw their beer was gone<br>
They threw me in the parking lot<br>
Hey, that's somebody's --<p>

Beer! OH! -- Put it down and leave<br>
You poor unsightly slob<br>
Beer, OH! -- We don't want no nerds here<br>
So leave this house of snobs<br>
Beer, OH! -- Not the master drinker<br>
Who wins the quarters game<br>
Beer, OH! -- Not a glamour boy<br>
Go hang your head in shame<br>
Everybody's yelling<br>
SOMEBODY'S BEER!  OH!<p>

As the hours went by, I drank quite a lot<br>
When they saw my beer was gone<br>
They threw me in the parking lot<p>

Beer. OH!<p>
