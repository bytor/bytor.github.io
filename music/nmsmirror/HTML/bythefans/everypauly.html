by Dennis Pupello<br>
<em>November 24, 1993</em>
<p>

In the house where Cindy just laughs<br>
And the audience sleeps<br>
On the channel where Rush lies dormant<br>
And the audience grieves<br>
Boys and girls watch shaking<br>
With their hands on their ears<br>
Pushing back the tears<br>
Till the sound disappears<p>

Pauly says some ugly words<br>
"Buddy" pounds the walls<br>
He might think about his audience later<br>
But right now he don't care at all<p>

No matter what they say<br>
No matter what they play<p>

Everyday Pauly<br>
Everyday shame<br>
Every "Hey Buddy"<br>
Shot down in flames<br>
Rise like a fascist<br>
In a blaze of Everyday Pauly<p>

On the station where music's defiled<br>
And music's no fun<br>
On the channel where desperation<br>
Drives the bored to VH1<p>

Just one spark of lienency against the starless night<br>
One glow of creativity<br>
A rain can follow the blight<p>

Everyday Pauly<br>
Everday shame<br>
Every "Hey Buddy"<br>
Shot down in flames<br>
Everyday sunrise--<br>
Another everyday folly<br>
Rise from the ashes<br>
It's a phase of Everyday Pauly<p>

If he walks across the park<br>
We're the ones who'll set the mine<br>
If we use remote controls<br>
We won't have to pay the fine<p>

Though we live in Pauly times<br>
We're the ones who hate this guy<br>
Though we dread when Pauly speaks<br>
We're the ones who have to cry<p>
