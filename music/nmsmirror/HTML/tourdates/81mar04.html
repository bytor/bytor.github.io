<font size=+1>Review of Rush Show - The Checkerdome - 3/4/81</font><br>
<b>by Dick Ricmond</b><p>

It was Canadian rock at its most intricate last night as Rush and Max
Webster shared the program at the Checkerdome.  Both bands will be there
again tonight.<p>

Rush is a trio featuring Geddy Lee on bass, keyboards, and vocals; Neil
Peart on percussion, and Alex Lifeson on guitars.  It's not the only rock
trio that has enjoyed such tremendous success.  There is one distinction
between it and it's contemporaries, however.  Considering that only three
instruments are being played at any one time -- and one of those is drums --
Rush's music is pretty complicated by comparison.<p>

No one would ever walk away from one of the trio's concerts humming one of
its tunes.  Still, one cannot help but have a deep appreciation of what
they are able to achieve with what they have.<p>

Being just a trio on a large stage makes them look pretty small from much
of the Checkerdome.  They have taken pains to reduce those visual
shortcomings by using large rear-screen projections to illustrate some of
their songs.<p>

When they opened, the crowd rushed the stage.  The security people did
their best to keep people seated throughout the show, but never quite got
the crowd settled down.<p>

Rush opened with an intense song that had Lee singing falsetto, then moved
into one their hard-rock numbers, "Freewill", from their "Permanent Waves"
album.<p>

Lee sang falsetto once again when they did "Limelight" from their current
album "Moving Pictures".  The rear-screen projection was a swirl toward the
center of infinity.<p>

They continued to give a sampling of works from their last several albums
when they played the prelude from the title track of "Hemispheres", one of
their more cerebral works.  To emphasize the suggestion that Rush is a
thinking man's rock band, as they played this, the moving picture behind
them had two brains floating in clouds.<p>

"Beneath, Between, Behind" was next, followed by two more new songs, one
called "The Camera Eye", on which Lee, who has a distinctive technique on
bass, demonstrated his ability on the keyboards.  That was followed by an
instrumental "YYZ", which gave Peart the opportunity for a long and
sometimes interesting drum solo.<p>

Of the rest of the program, which included "Xanadu" and "The Spirit Of
Radio" among other songs, the one that set the crowd off the most was "The
Trees", another selection from "Hemispheres".  The peaceful visuals that
were used in contrast to the catchy percussion made this number
particularly notable.<p>

Max Webster is a quintet, which gives this band somewhat more instrumental
flexibility than their friends in Rush.  The members of Rush appeared as
guest artists on Max Webster's latest album, "Universal Juveniles".<p>

Max Webster opened with "Check", a song from that album.  It was not a
particularly good choice because it was over before a person's head was
into it.  As a matter of fact, it wasn't until they moved into "In The
World Of Giants", a double-time number, that the crowd got caught up in
what they were doing.<p>

Max Webster offered a fair sampling of their latest songs.  "In The World
Of Giants" is new as is "Drive And Desire", which they played next.
Nothing they played could be considered commercial.  Still, the longer they
were on stage, the more a person began to appreciate what they were doing.<p>

The band had a substantial set, playing songs such as "In The Context Of
The Moon", "Waterline", "The Party", and "Battlescar".  Of those,
"Waterline", which has been released on a couple of their albums, gave
singer Kim Mitchell the opportunity to display his vocal versatility.<p>
