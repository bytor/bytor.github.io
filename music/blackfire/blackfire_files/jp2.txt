Derek, 

This appears to be the "Black Fire" guitar
we made for John. It is one of the last 
prototypes we made before the first hand 
signed run. The color is Dupont Chromalusion 
Black Fire, which is something his tech 
thought would be cool. John liked the 
Chromalusion concept, but not this 
specific color, and we then introduced
the "Mystic Dream" color.It is also prior
to the special design Petrucci knobs. 

Re. piezo; Petrucci guitars come with piezo
as an option, and this one was ordered without. 
John has several guitars with the piezo, and 
several without. 

I don't know why there is no record of this
serial number, or if we have any record of 
this Black Fire prototype.

Hopefully you can help in this matter. I 
collect rare guitars and was fortunate enough
to acquire an EB/MM John Petrucci Model 
Prototype last spring. I tried to arrange 
something with the seller to have 
Mr. Petrucci send me something to authenticate
the rarity of this unit but since Mr. Petrucci
is quite busy, and rightly so, I have not 
received anything from him or the seller. Which
is why I'm writing you as a "second source". 
I've attached JPEGimages for your examination.
The serial number on the neckplate is "G12101". 
Differences in this unit and production models are
the lack of the Petrucci signature on the headstock,
the "top hat' knobs on the volume/tone controls
instead of the "barrel" knobs, and the lack of
a piezo output control on the back of the guitar.
If there is any info you could release to 
confirm that this is indeed a prototype, without
violating company policy, it would be of great 
assistance. Such info could include date of 
manufacture, run length (i.e. this is the "nth" 
guitar out of "y" made), or anything you may 
deem adequate to prove this unit's authenticity
and/or rarity. Thanks for your help!
