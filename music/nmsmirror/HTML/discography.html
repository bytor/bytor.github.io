I'm currently in the process of redoing all the discography stuff into
a better format. It'll have a main, text-only page, and then links to each
item with pictures, description, and any other useful info. Right now
only the CD singles are done, so collectors grab your singles and let me know
if there are any glaring errors!!!<p>
