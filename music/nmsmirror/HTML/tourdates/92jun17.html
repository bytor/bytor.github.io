<font size=+1>Rush drops the stone-faced act and has fun</font><br>

<b>by Paul Robicheau</b><p>

MANSFIELD -- There were dice on bassist Geddy Lee's amp and, at one point, on
the three video screens flaking the stage. But Rush is a technically polished
band that leaves little to chance in concert.<p>

True, the Canadian power trio's crew had trouble sharpening the sound mix in
the Great Woods shed last night for a rare outdoor local show by Rush. Hey,
they're used to indoor arenas. But Rush often tends toward busy, methodical
execution that works its way into a blur anyway.<p>

Certainly that was the case in the opening stretch of the group's soldout show
for a throng of 15,000 that soaked in the two-hour-plus show, then shared a
war whoop on the way out. Perhaps it was a reaction to that encore medley that
fused the heady old instrumentals "La Villa Strangiato" and "YYZ" before 
exploding into the Ayn Rand-inspired "Anthem," striking a chord for personal
freedom.<p>

By contrast, the set's first half-dozen songs were delivered with static
precision, heavy on video accompaniment and drummer Neil Peart's mathematical
dexterity (when he dons headphones for certain songs, does he listen to
equations?). You know when Rush shows Aimee Mann singing on video during the
hit "Time Stand Still," it would gum up the works to conceive of her making a
live cameo for the group's Boston stop.<p>

Nonetheless, as Lee later sang in the clap-along "Spirit of the Radio," "All
this machinery making modern music can still be open-hearted." Rush might push
the envelope as a three-piece, leaning on electronic triggers in concert. But
the band also rocked out during a mid-set peak that began with new song "Roll
the Bones" (with video dice turning into rapping skeletons), followed by the
hard-edged blasts through "Show Don't Tell" and "The Big Money" that broke
cruise control with Peart's muscular fills.<p>

And you can't say Rush doesn't depart from stone-faced delivery to have fun.
Guitarist Alex Lifeson was especially frisky, playing to fans near the stage
with hand motions to mimic his whammy bar sustains. And the giant inflatable
rabbits jiggling for "Tom Sawyer" are now predictable, but still a good goof
on arena excess.<p>

Granted, the visual end of Rush's show -- cartoonish videos, lasers and spacey
roving lights -- add a touch of pretension. But Rush has always balanced
energetic kicks and textural twists. And the program played to old as well as
new fans with inclusions such as "Free Will," "Analog Kid" and late '70s
art-rock nuggets "The Trees" and "Xanadu," flavored by tricky cowbell patterns
from Peart, who also did his usual everything-but-the-kitchen-sink powerhouse
solo.<p>

Powerhouse solos were the best thing going for opener Mr. Big, and they fell
flat, as both bassist Billy Sheehan and guitarist Paul Gilbert flogged speed
licks (and Gilbert pulled out a power drill pick a la Eddie Van Halen). With a
combination of MTV power balladry (the hit "To Be With You") and forced-flair
rock, Mr. Big lacked all the smarts of Rush, whose hit love song "Ghost of a
Chance" even had a philosophical tone. Ironically, Mr. Big's final number was
"Addicted to That Rush." During an encore of "2112," on cue, Rush fans yelled
"Hey!" en masse in agreement.<p>
