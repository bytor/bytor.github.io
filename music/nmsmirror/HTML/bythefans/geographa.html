I just don't get it<br>
Where it is...Well, I'm not really sure.<br>
I sit here, my test book before me<br>
And my mind is insecure.<p>

The world's full of places - my head hits the wall.<br>
Each dot is a city - this test wants to know them all.<br>
The teacher's a sadist, the subject's a bore<br>
Geography's useless, and I'm gonna snore<br>
Right through it...<br>
Yeah, I snored right through it.<p>

Lithuania - Romania<br>
It's just Albania - Tasmania<br>
It's Macedonia - Estonia<br>
It's just Siberia - Liberia<p>

I just don't get it<br>
Maybe I should ask myself why...<br>
I shouldn't have cut all those classes<br>
Do I get extra credit if I cry?<p>

Everest's a mountain, Loch Ness is a lake.<br>
But that's all I know, and I've run out of time to fake.<br>
This whole thing's a hassle, this test is a pain.<br>
I sit here and watch as my grade trickles down the drain...<br>
Yeah, it's down the drain.<p>

MAPS!<br>
I sit in my chair with my hands in my hair<br>
All my knowledge is leaving me.<br>
MAPS!<br>
Sweat on my brow, where the hell is Moscow?<br>
And my mind is deceiving me.<br>
MAPS!<br>
The world is a mess, gonna fail the test<br>
And my prof'll be peeved at me...<br>
MAPS!<p>

Assyria - Algeria<br>
It's just Namibia - Bohemia<br>
It's Ethiopia - Australia<br>
It's just Sumeria - Bavaria...<p>
