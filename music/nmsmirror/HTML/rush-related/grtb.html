Suddenly Joe Slattermill knew for sure he'd have to get out quick or else blow
his top and knock out with the shrapnel of his skull the props and patches
holding up his decaying home, that was like a house of big wooden and plaster
and wallpaper cards except for the huge fireplace and ovens and chimney across
the kitchen from him.<p>

     Those were stone-solid enough, though. The fireplace was chin-high at
least twice that long, and filled from end to end with roaring flames. Above
were the square doors of the ovens in a row -- his Wife baked for part of
their living. Above the ovens was the wall-long mantelpiece, too high for his
Mother to reach or Mr. Guts to jump any more, set with all sorts of ancestral
curios, but any of them that weren't stone or glass or china had been so dried
and darkened by decades of heat that they looked like nothing but shrunken
human heads and black gold balls. At one end were clustered his Wife's square
gin bottles. Above the mantelpiece hung on old chromo, so high and so darkened
by soot and grease that you couldn't tell whether the swirls and fat cigar
shape were a whaleback steamer plowing through ta hurricane or a spaceship
plunging through a storm of light-driven dust motes.<p>

     As soon as Joe curled his toes inside his boots, his Mother knew what he
was up to. "Going bumming," she mumbled with conviction. "Pants pockets full
of cartwheels of house money, too, to spend on sin." And she went back to
munching the long shreds she stripped fumblingly with her right hand off the
turkey carcass set close to the terrible heat, her left hand ready to fend off
Mr. Guts, who stared at her yellow-eyed, gaunt-flanked, with long mangy tail
a-twitch. In her dirty dress, streaky as the turkey's sides, Joe's Mother
looked like a bent brown bag and her fingers were lumpy twigs.<p>

     Joe's Wife knew as soon or sooner, for she smiled thin-eyed at him over
her shoulder from where she towered at the centermost oven. Before she closed
its door, Joe glimpsed that she was baking two long, flat, narrow, fluted
loaves and one high, round-domed one. She was thin as death and disease in her
violet wrapper. Without looking, she reached out a yard-long, skinny arm for
the nearest gin bottle and downed a warm slug and smiled again. And without
word spoken, Joe knew she'd said, "You're going out and gamble and get drunk
and lay a floozy and come home and beat me and go to jail for it," and he had
a flash of the last time he'd been in the dark gritty cell and she'd come by
moonlight, which showed the green and yellow lumps on her narrow skull where
he'd hit her, to whisper to him through the tiny window in back and slip him a
half pint through the bars.<p>

     And Joe knew for certain that this time it would be that bad and worse, 
but just the same he heaved up himself and his heavy, muffledly clanking 
pockets and shuffled straight to the door, muttering, "Guess I'll roll the 
bones, up the pike a stretch and back," swinging his bent, knobby-elbowed arms 
like paddlewheels to make a little joke about his words.<p>

     When he'd stepped outside, he held the door open a hand's breadth behind
him for several seconds. When he finally closed it, a feeling of deep misery
struck him. Earlier years, Mr. Guts would have come streaking along to seek
fights and females on the roofs and fences, but now the big tom was content to
stay home and hiss by the fire and snatch for turkey and dodge a broom,
quarreling and comforting with two housebound women. Nothing had followed Joe
to the door but his Mother's chomping and her gasping breaths and the clink of
the gin bottle going back on the mantel and the creaking of the floor boards
under his feet.<p>

     The night was up-side-down deep among the frosty stars. A few of the
seemed to move, like the white-hot jets of spaceships. Down below it looked as
if the whole town of Ironmine had blown or buttoned out the light and gone to
sleep, leaving the streets and spaces to the equally unseen breezes and
ghosts. But Joe was still in the hemisphere of the musty dry odor of the
worm-eaten carpentry behind him, and as he felt and heard the dry grass of the
lawn brush his calves, it occurred to him that something deep down inside him
had for years been planning things so that he and the house and his Wife and
Mother and Mr. Guts would all come to an end together. Why the kitchen heat
hadn't touched off the tindery place ages ago was a physical miracle.<p>

     Hunching his shoulders, Joe stepped out, not up the pike, but down the
dirt road that led past Cypress Hollow Cemetery to Night Town.<p>

     The breezes were gentle, but unusually restless and variable tonight,
like leprechaun squalls. Beyond the drunken, whitewashed cemetery fence dim in
the starlight, they rustled the scraggly trees of Cypress Hollow and made it
seem they were stroking their beards of Spanish moss. Joe sensed that the
ghosts were just as restless as the breezes, uncertain where and whom to
haunt, or whether to take the might off, drifting together in sorrowfully
lecherous companionship. While among the trees the red-green vampire lights
pulsed faintly and irregularly, like sick fireflies or a plague-stricken space
fleet. The feeling of deep misery stuck with Joe and deepened and he was
tempted to turn aside and curl up in any convenient tomb or around some
half-toppled head board and cheat his Wife and the other three behind him out
of a shared doom. He though: Gonna roll the bones, gonna roll 'em up and go to
sleep. But while he was deciding, he got past the sagged-open gate and the rest
of the delirious fence and Shantyville too.<p>

     At first Night Town seemed dead as the rest of Ironmine, but then he
noticed a faint glow, sick as the vampire lights but more feverish, and with
it a jumping music, tiny at first as a jazz for jitterbugging ants. He stepped
along the springy sidewalk, wistfully remembering the days when the spring was
all in his own legs and he'd bound into a fight like a bobcat or a Martian
sand-spider. God, it had been years now since he had fought a real fight, or
felt <strong>the power</strong>. Gradually the midget music got raucous as a bunnyhug for
grizzly bears and loud as a polka for elephants, while the glow became a riot
of gas flares and flambeaux and corpse-blue mercury tubes and jiggling pink
neon ones that all jeered at the stars where the spaceships roved. Next thing,
he was facing a three-story false front flaring everywhere like a devil's
rainbow, with a pale blue topping of St. Elmo's fire. There were wide swinging
doors in the center of it, spilling light above and below. Above the doorway,
golden calcium light scrawled over and over again, with wild curlicues and
flourishes, "The Boneyard," while a fiendish red kept printing out,
"Gambling."<p>

     So the new place they'd all been talking about for so long had opened at
last! For the first time that night, Joe Slattermill felt a stirring of real
life in him and the faintest caress of excitement.<p>

     Gonna roll the bones, he thought.<p>

     He dusted off his blue-green work clothes with big, careless swipes and
slapped his pockets to hear the clank. Then he threw back his shoulders and
grinned his lips sneeringly and pushed through the swinging doors as if giving
a foe the straight-armed heel of his palm.<p>

     Inside, The Boneyard seemed to cover the area of a township and the bar
looked as long as the railroad tracks. Round pools of light on the green poker
tables alternated with hourglass shapes of exciting gloom, through which drink
girls and change girls moved like white-legged witches. By the jazz-stand in
the distance, belly dancers made <strong>their</strong> white hourglass shapes. The gamblers
were thick and hunched down as mushrooms, all bald from agonizing over the
fall of a card or a die or the dive of an ivory ball, while the Scarlet Women
were like fields of poinsettia.<p>

     The calls of the croupiers and the slaps of dealt cards were as softly
yet fatefully staccato as the rustle and beat of the jazz drums. Every
tight-locked atom of the place was controlledly jumping. Even the dust motes
jigged tensely in the cones of light.<p>

     Joe's excitement climbed and he felt sift through him, like a breeze that
heralds a gale, the faintest breath of a confidence which he knew could become
a tornado. All thoughts of his house and Wife and Mother dropped out of his
mind, while Mr. Guts remained only as a crazy young tom walking stiff-legged
around the rim of his consciousness. Joe's own leg muscles twitched in
sympathy and he felt them grow supplely strong.<p>

     He coolly and searchingly looked the place over, his hand going out like
it didn't belong to him to separate a drink from a passing, gently bobbing
tray. Finally his gaze settled on what he judged to be the Number One Crap
Table. All the Big Mushrooms seemed to be there, bald as the rest but standing
tall as toadstools. Then through a gap in them Joe saw on the other side of
the table a figure still taller, but dressed in a long dark coat with collar
turned up and a dark slouch hat pulled low, so that only a triangle of white
face showed. A suspicion and a hope rose in Joe and he headed straight for the
gap in the Big Mushrooms.<p>

     As he got nearer, the white-legged and shiny-topped drifters eddying out
of his way, his suspicion received confirmation after confirmation and his hope
budded and swelled. Back from one end of the table was the fattest man he'd
ever seen, with a long cigar and a silver vest and a gold tie clasp at least
eight inches wide that just said in thick script, "Mr. Bones." Back a little
from the other end was the nakedest change-girl yet and the only one he'd seen
whose tray, slung from her bare shoulders and indenting her belly just below
her breasts, was stacked with gold in gleaming little towers and with
jet-black chips. While the dice-girl, skinnier and taller and longer armed
than his Wife even, didn't seem to be wearing much but a pair of long white
gloves. She was all right if you went for the type that isn't much more than
pale skim over bones with breasts like china doorknobs.<p>

     Beside each gambler was a high round table for his chips. The one by the
gap was empty. Snapping his fingers at the nearest silver change-girl, Joe
traded all his greasy dollars for an equal number of pale chips and tweaked
her left nipple for luck. She playfully snapped her teeth toward his fingers.<p>

     Not hurrying but not wasting any time, he advanced and carelessly dropped
his modest stacks on the empty table and took his place in the gap. He noted
that the second Big Mushroom on his right had the dice. His heart but no other
part of him gave an extra jump. Then he steadily lifted his eyes and looked
straight across the table.<p>

     The coat was a shimmering elegant pillar of black satin with jet buttons,
the upturned collar of fine dull plush black as the darkest cellar, as was the
slouch hat with down-turned brim and for band only a thin braid of black
horsehair. The arms of the coat were long, lesser satin pillars, ending in
slim, long-fingered hands that moved swiftly when they did, but held each
position of rest with a statue's poise.<p>

     Joe still couldn't see much of the face except for smooth lower forehead
with never a bead or trickle of sweat -- the eyebrows were like straight
snippets of the hat's braid -- and gaunt, aristorcratic cheeks and narrow but
somewhat flat nose. The complexion of the face wasn't as white as Joe had
first judged. There was a faint touch of brown in it, like ivory that's just
begun to age, or Venusian soapstone. Another glance at the hands confirmed
this.<p>

     Behind the man in black was a know of just about the flashiest and
nastiest customers, male or female, Joe had ever seen. He knew from one look
that each bediamonded, pomaded bully had a belly gun beneath the flap of his
flowered vest and a blackjack in his hip pocket, and each snake-eyed sporting
girl a stiletto in her garter and a pearl-handed silver-plated derringer under
the sequined silk in the hollow between her jutting breasts.<p>

     Yet at the same time Joe knew they were just trimmings. It was the man in
black, their master, who was the deadly one, the kind of man you knew at a
glance you couldn't touch and live. If without asking you merely laid a finger
on his sleeve, no matter how lightly and respectfully, an ivory hand would
move faster than thought and you'd be stabbed or shot. Or maybe just the touch
would kill you, as if every black article of his clothing were charged from
his ivory skin outward with a high-voltage, high-amperage ivory electricity.
Joe looked at the shadowed face again and decided he wouldn't care to try it.<p>

     For it was the eyes that were the most impressive feature. All great
gamblers have dark-shadowed deep-set eyes. But this one's eyes were sunk so
deep you couldn't even be sure you were getting a gleam of them. They were
inscrutability incarnate. They were unfathomable. They were like black holes.<p>

     But all this didn't disappoint Joe one bit, though it did terrify him
considerably. On the contrary, it made him exult. His first suspicion was
completely confirmed and his hope spread into full flower.<p>

     This must be one of those really big gamblers who hit Ironmine only once
a decade at most, come from the Big City on one of the river boats that ranged
the watery dark like luxurious comets, spouting long thick tails of sparks
from their sequoia-tall stacks with top foliage of curvy-snipped sheet iron.
Or like silver space-liners with dozens of jewel-flamed jets, their portholes
a-twinkle like ranks of marshaled asteroids.<p>

     For that matter, maybe some of those really big gamblers actually came
from other planets where the nighttime pace was hotter and the sporting life a
delirium of risk and delight.<p>

     Yes, this was the kind of man Joe had always yearned to pit his skill
against. He felt <strong>the power</strong> begin to tingle in this rock-still fingers, just
a little.<p>

     Joe lowered his gaze to the crap table. It was almost as wide as a man is
tall, at least twice as long, unusually deep, and lined with black, not green,
felt, so that it looked like a giant's coffin. There was something familiar
about its shape which he couldn't place. Its bottom, though not its sides or
ends, had a twinkling iridescence, as if it had been lightly sprinkled with
very tiny diamonds. As Joe lowered his gaze all the way and looked directly
down, his eyes barely over the table, he got the crazy notion that it went
down all the way through the world, so that the diamonds were the stars on the
other side, visible despite the sunlight there, just as Joe was always able to
see the stars by day up the shaft of the mine he worked in, and so that if a
cleaned-out gambler, dizzy with defeat, toppled forward into it, he'd fall
forever, toward the bottommost bottom, be it Hell or some black galaxy. Joe's
thoughts swirled and he felt the cold, hard-fingered clutch of fear at his
crotch. Someone was crooning beside him, "Come on, Big Dick."<p>

     Then the dice, which had meanwhile passed to the Big Mushroom immediately
on his right, came to rest near the table's center, contradicting and wiping
out Joe's vision. But instantly there was another oddity to absorb him. The
ivory dice were large and unusually round-cornered with dark red spots that
gleamed like real rubies, but the spots were arranged in such a way that each
face looked like a miniature skull. For instance, the seven thrown just now,
by which the Big Mushroom to his right had lost his point, which had been
ten, consisted of a two with spots evenly spaced toward one side, like eyes,
instead of toward opposite corners, and of a five with the same red eye-spots
but also a central red nose and two spots close together below that to make
teeth.<p>

     The long, skinny, white-gloved arm of the dice-girl snaked out like an
albino cobra and scooped up the dice and whisked them onto the rim of the
table right in front of Joe. He inhaled silently, picked up a single chip from
his table and started to lay it beside the dice, then realized that wasn't the
way things were done here, and put it back. He would have liked to examine the
chip more closely, though. It was curiously lightweight and pale tan, about
the color of cream with a shot of coffee in it, and it had embossed on its
surface a symbol he could feel, though not see. He didn't know what the symbol
was, that would have taken more feeling. Yet its touch had been very good,
setting the power tingling full blast in his shooting hand.<p>

     Joe looked casually yet swiftly at the faces around the table, not
missing the Big Gambler across from him, and said quietly, "Roll a penny,"
meaning of course one pale chip, or a dollar.<p>

     There was a hiss of indignation from all the Big Mushrooms and the
moonface of big-bellied Mr. Bones grew purple as he started forward to summon
his bouncers.<p>

     The Big Gambler raised a black-satined forearm and sculptured hand, palm
down. Instantly Mr. Bones froze and the hissing stopped faster than that of a
meteor prick in self-sealing space steel. Then in a whispery, cultured voice,
without the faintest hint of derision, the man in black said, "Get on him,
gamblers."<p>

     Here, Joe thought, was a final confirmation of his suspicion, had it
been needed. The really great gamblers were always perfect gentlemen and
generous to the poor.<p>

     With only the tiny, respectful hint of a guffaw, one of the Big Mushrooms
called to Joe, "You're faded."<p>

     Joe picked up the ruby-featured dice.<p>

     Now ever since he had first caught two eggs on one plate, won all the
marbles in Ironmine, and juggled six alphabet blocks so they finally fell in a
row on the rug spelling "Mother," Joe Slattermill had been almost incredibly
deft at precision throwing. In the mine he could carom a rock off a wall of
ore to crack a rat's skull fifty feet away in the dark and he sometimes amused
himself by tossing little fragments of rock back into the holes from which
they had fallen, so that they stuck there, perfectly fitted in, for at least a
second. Sometimes, by fast tossing, he could fit seven or eight fragments into
the hole from which they had fallen, like putting together a puzzle block. If
he could ever have got into space, Joe would undoubtedly have been able to
pilot six Moon-skimmers at once and do figure eights through Saturn's rings
blindfold.<p>

     Now the only real difference between precision-tossing rocks or alphabet
blocks and dice is that you have to bounce the latter off the end wall of a
crap table, and that just made it a more interesting test of skill for Joe.<p>

     Rattling the dice now, he felt the power in his fingers and palm as never
before.<p>

     He made a swift low roll, so that the bones ended up exactly in front of
the white-gloved dice-girl. His natural seven was made up, as he'd intended,
of a four and a three. In red-spot features they were like the five, except
that both had only one tooth and the three no nose. Sort of baby-faced skulls.
He had won a penny -- that is, a dollar.<p>

     "Roll two cents," said Joe Slattermill.<p>

     This time, for variety, he made his natural with an eleven. The six was
like the five, except it had three teeth, the best-looking skull of the lot.<p>

     "Roll a nickel less one."<p>

     Two Big Mushrooms divided that bet with a covert smirk at each other.<p>

     Now Joe rolled a three and an ace. His point was four. The ace, with its
single spot off center toward a side, still somehow looked like a skull --
maybe of a Lilliputian cyclops.<p>

     He took a while making his point, once absent-mindedly rolling three
successive tens the hard way. He wanted to watch the dice-girl scoop up the
cubes. Each time it seemed to him that her snake-swift fingers went under the
dice while they were still flat on the felt. Finally he decided it couldn't be
an illusion. Although the dice couldn't penetrate the felt, her white-gloved
fingers somehow could, dipping in a flash through the black, diamond-sparkling
material as if it weren't there.<p>

     Right away the thought of a crap-table-size hole through the earth came
back to Joe. This would mean that the dice were rolling and lying on a
perfectly transparent flat surface, impenetrable for them but nothing else. Or
maybe it was only the dice-girl's hands that could penetrate the surface,
which would turn into a mere fantasy Joe's earlier vision of a cleaned-out
gambler taking the Big Dive down that dreadful shaft, which made the deepest
mine a mere pin dent.<p>

     Joe decided he had to know which was true. Unless absolutely unavoidable,
he didn't want to take the chance of being troubled by vertigo at some crucial
stage of the game.<p>

     He made a few more meaningless throws, from time to time crooning for
realism, "Come on, Little Joe." Finally he settled on his plan. When he did at
last make his point -- the hard way, with two twos -- he caromed the dice off
the far corner so that they landed exactly in front of him. Then after a
minimum pause for his throw to be seen by the table, he shot his left hand
down under the cubes, just a flicker ahead of the dice-girl's strike, and
snatched them up.<p>

     Wow! Joe had never had a harder time in his life making his face and
manner conceal what his body felt, not even when the wasp had stung him on the
neck just as he had been for the first time putting his hand under the skirt
of his prudish, fickle, demanding Wife-to-be. His fingers and the back of his
hand were in as much agony as if he'd stuck them into a blast furnace. No
wonder the dice-girl wore white gloves. They must be asbestos. And a good
thing he hadn't used his shooting hand, he thought as he ruefully watched the
blisters rise.<p>

     He remembered he'd been taught in school what Twenty-Mile Mine also
demonstrated: that the earth was fearfully hot under its crust. The
crap-table-size hole must pipe up that heat, so that any gambler taking the
Big Dive would fry before he'd fallen a furlong and come out less than a
cinder in China.<p>

     As if his blistered hand weren't bad enough, the Big Mushrooms were all
hissing at him again and Mr. Bones had purpled once more and was opening his
melon-size mouth to shout for his bouncers.<p>

     Once again a lift of the big Gambler's hand saved Joe. The whispery,
gentle voice called, "Tell him, Mr. Bones."<p>

     The latter roared toward Joe, "No gambler may pick up the dice he or any
other gambler has shot. Only my dice-girl may do that. Rule of the house!"<p>

     Joe snapped Mr. Bones the barest nod. He said coolly, "Rolling a dime
less two," and when that still peewee bet was covered, he shot Phoebe for his
point and then fooled around for quite a while, throwing anything but a five
or a seven, until the throbbing in his left hand should fade and all his
nerves feel rock-solid again. There had never been the slightest alteration in
the power in his right hand; he felt that strong as ever, or stronger.<p>

     Midway of this interlude, the Big Gambler bowed slightly but respectfully
toward Joe, hooding those unfathomable eye sockets, before turning around to
take a long black cigarette from his prettiest and evilest-looking sporting
girl. Courtest in the smallest matters, Joe thought, another mark of the
master devotee of games of chance. The Big Gambler sure had himself a flash
crew all right, though in idly looking them over again as he rolled, Joe noted
one bummer toward the back who didn't fit in -- a raggedy-elegant chap with
the elflocked hair and staring eyes and TB-spotted cheeks of a poet.<p>

     As he watched the smoke trickling up from under the black slouch hat, he
decided that either the lights across the table had dimmed or else the Big
Gambler's complexion was yet a shade darker than he'd though at first. Or it
might even be -- wild fantasy -- that the Big Gambler's skin was slowly
darkening tonight, like a meerschaum pipe being smoked a mile a second. That
was almost funny to think of -- there was enough heat in this place, all
right, to darken meerschaum, as Joe knew from sad experience, but so far as he
was aware it was all under the table.<p>

     None of Joe's thoughts, either familiar or admiring, about the Big
Gambler decreased in the slightest degree his certainty of the supreme menace
of the man in black and his conviction that it would be death to touch him.
And if any doubts had stirred in Joe's mind, they would have been squelched by
the chilling incident which next occurred.<p>

     The big Gambler had just taken into his arms his prettiest-evilest
sporting girl and was running an aristocratic hand across her haunch with
perfect gentility, when the poet chap, green-eyed from jealousy and
lovesickness, came leaping forward like a wildcat and aimed a long gleaming
dagger at the black satin back.<p>

     Joe couldn't see how the blow could miss, but without taking his genteel
right hand off the sporting girl's plush rear end, the Big Gambler shot out
his left arm like a steel spring straightening. Joe couldn't tell whether he
stabbed the poet chap in the throat, or judo-chopped him there, or gave him
the Martian double-finger, or just touched him, but anyhow the fellow stopped
as dead as if he'd been shot by a silent elephant gun or an invisible ray
pistol and he slammed down on the floor. A couple of darkies came running up
to drag off the body and nobody paid the least attention, such episodes
apparently being taken for granted at The Boneyard.<p>

     It gave Joe quite a turn and he almost shot Phoebe before he intended to.<p>

     But by now the waves of pain had stopped running up his left arm and his
nerves were like metal-wrapped new guitar strings, so three rolls later he
shot a five, making his point, and set in to clean out the table.<p>

     He rolled nine successive naturals, seven sevens and two elevens,
pyramiding his first wager of a single chip to a stake of over four thousand
dollars. None of the Big Mushrooms had dropped out yet, but some of them were
beginning to look worried and a couple were sweating. The Big Gambler still
hadn't covered any part of Joe's bets, but he seemed to be following the play
with interest from the cavernous depths of his eye sockets.<p>

     The Joe got a devilish thought. Nobody could beat him tonight, he knew,
but if he held onto the dice until the table was cleaned out, he'd never get a
chance to see the Big Gambler exercise <strong>his</strong> skill, and he was truly curious
about that. Besides, he thought, he ought to return courtesy for courtesy and
have a crack at being a gentleman himself.<p>

     "Pulling out forty-one dollars less a nickel," he announced. "Rolling a
penny."<p>

     This time there wasn't any hissing and Mr. Bones's moonface didn't cloud
over. But Joe was conscious that the Big Gambler was staring at him
disappointedly, or sorrowfully, or maybe just speculatively.<p>

     Joe immediately crapped out by throwing boxcars, rather pleased to see 
the two best-looking tiny skulls grinning ruby-toothed side by side, and the
dice passed to the Big Mushroom on his left.<p>

     "Knew when his streak was over," he heard another Big Mushroom mutter
with grudging admiration.<p>

     The play worked rather rapidly around the table, nobody getting very hot
and the stakes never more than medium high. "Shoot a fin." "Rolling a
sawbuck." "An Andrew Jackson." "Rolling thirty bucks." Now and then Joe
covered part of a bet, winning more than he lost. He had over seven thousand
dollars, real money, before the bones got around to the Big Gambler. <p>

     That one held the dice for a long moment on his statue-steady palm while
he looked at them reflectively, though not the hint of a furrow appeared in
his almost brownish forehead down which never a bead of sweat trickled. He
murmured, "Rolling a double sawbuck," and when he had been faded, he closed
his fingers, lightly rattled the cubes -- the sound was like big seeds inside
a small gourd only half dry -- and negligently cast the dice toward the end of
the table.<p>

     It was a throw like none Joe had ever seen before at any crap table. The
dice traveled flat through the air without turning over, struck the exact
juncture of the table's end and bottom, and stopped there dead, showing a
natural seven.<p>

     Joe was distinctly disappointed. On one of his own throws he was used to
calculating something like, "Launch three-up, five north, two and a half rolls
in the air, hit on the six-five-three corner, three-quarter roll and a
one-quarter side-twist right, hit end on the one-two edge, one-half reverse
roll and three-quarter side-twist left, land on five face, roll over twice,
come up two," and that would be for just one of the dice, and a really
commonplace throw, without extra bounces.<p>

     By comparison, the technique of the big Gambler had been ridiculously,
abysmally, horrifyingly simple. Joe could have duplicated it with the greatest
of ease, of course. It was no more than an elementary form of his old pastime
of throwing fallen rocks back into their holes. But Joe had never once thought
of pulling such a babyish trick at the crap table. It would make the whole
thing too easy and destroy the beauty of the game.<p>

     Another reason Joe had never used the trick was that he'd never dreamed
he'd be able to get away with it. By all the rules he'd ever heard of, it was
a most questionable throw. There was the possibility that one of the other die
hadn't completely reached the end of the table, or lay a wee bit cocked
against the end. Besides, he reminded himself, weren't both dice supposed to
rebound off the end, if only for a fraction of an inch?<p>

     However, as far as Joe's very sharp eyes could see, both dice lay
perfectly flat and sprang up against the end wall. Moreover, everyone else at
the table seemed to accept the throw, the dice-girl had scooped up the cubes,
and the Big Mushrooms who had faded the man in black were paying off. As far
as the rebound business went, well, The Boneyard appeared to put a slightly
different interpretation on that rule, and Joe believed in never questioning
House Rules except in dire extremity -- both his Mother and Wife had long
since taught him it was the least troublesome way.<p>

     Besides, there hadn't been any of his own money riding on that roll.<p>

     In a voice like wind through Cypress Hollow or on Mars, the Big Gambler
announced, "Roll a century." It was the biggest bet yet tonight, ten thousand
dollars, and the way the Big Gambler said it made it seem something more than
that. A hush fell on The Boneyard, they put the mutes on the jazz horns, the
croupiers' calls became more confidential, the cards fell softlier, even the
roulette balls seemed to be trying to make less noise as they rattled into
their cells. The crowd around the Number One Crap Table quickly thickened. The
Big Gambler's flash boys and girls formed a double semicircle around him,
ensuring him lost of elbow room.<p>

     That century bet, Joe realized, was thirty bucks more than his own entire
pile. Three or four of the Big Mushrooms had to signal each other before
they'd agreed how to fade it.<p>

     The Big Gambler shot another natural seven with exactly the same flat,
stop-dead throw.<p>

     He bet another century and did it again.<p>

     And again.<p>

     And again.<p>

     Joe was getting mighty concerned and pretty indignant too. It seemed
unjust that the Big Gambler should be winning such huge bets with such
machinelike, utterly unromantic rolls. Why, you couldn't even call them rolls,
the dice never turned over an iota, in the air or after. It was the sort of
thing you'd expect from a robot, and a very dully programmed robot at that.
Joe hadn't risked any of his own chips fading the Big Gambler, of course, but
if things went on like this he'd have to. Two of the Big Mushrooms had already
retired sweatingly from the table, confessing defeat, and no one had taken
their places. Pretty soon there's be a bet the remaining Big Mushrooms
couldn't entirely cover between them, and then he'd have to risk some of his
own chips or else pull out of the game himself -- and he couldn't do that, not
with the power surging in his right hand like chained lightning.<p>

     Joe waited and waited for someone else to question one of the Big
Gambler's shots, but no one did. He realized that, despite his efforts to look
imperturbable, his face was slowly reddening.<p>

     With a little lift of his left hand, the Big Gambler stopped the
dice-girl as she was about to snatch at the cubes. The eyes that were like
black wells directed themselves at Joe, who forced himself to look back into
them steadily. He still couldn't catch the faintest gleam in them. All at
once he felt the lightest touch-on-neck of a dreadful suspicion.<p>

     With the utmost civility and amiability, the Big Gambler whispered, "I
believe that the fine shooter across from me has doubts about the validity of
my last throw, though he is too much of a gentleman to voice them. Lottie, the
card test."<p>

     The wraith-tall, ivory dice-girl plucked a playing card from below the
table and with a venomous flash of her little white teeth spun it lot across
the table through the air at Joe. He caught the whirling pasteboard and
examined it briefly. It was the thinnest, stiffest, flattest, shiniest playing
card Joe had ever handled. It was also the Joker, if that meant anything. He
spun it back lazily into her hand and she slid it very gently, letting it
descend by its own weight, down the end wall against which the two dice lay.
It came to rest in the tiny hollow their rounded edges made against the black
felt. She deftly moved it about without force, demonstrating that there was no
space between either of the cubes and the table's end at any point.<p>

     "Satisfied?" the Big Gambler asked. Rather against his will Joe nodded.
The Big Gambler bowed to him. The dice-girl smirked her short, thin lips and
drew herself up, flaunting her white-china-doorknob breasts at Joe.<p>

     Casually, almost with an air of boredom, the Big Gambler returned to his
routine of shooting a century and making a natural seven. The Big Mushrooms
wilted fast and one by one tottered away from the table. A particularly
pink-faced Toadstool was brought extra cash by a gasping runner, but it was no
help, he only lost the additional centuries. While the stacks of pale and
black chips beside the Big Gambler grew skyscraper-tall.<p>

     Joe got more and more furious and frightened. He watched like a hawk or
spy satellite the dice nesting against the end wall, but never could spot
justification for calling another card test, or nerve himself to question the
House Rules at this late date. It was maddening, in fact insanitizing, to know
that if only he could get the cubes once more he could shoot circles around
that black pillar of sporting aristocracy. He damned himself a googelplex of
ways for the idiotic, conceited, suicidal impulse that had led him to let go
of the bones when he'd had them.<p>

     To make matters worse, the Big Gambler had taken to gazing steadily at
Joe with those eyes like coal mines. Now he made three rolls running without
even glancing at the dice or the end wall, as far as Joe could tell. Why, he
was getting as bad as Joe's Wife or Mother -- watching, watching, watching
Joe.<p>

     But the constant staring of those eyes that were not eyes was mostly
throwing a terrific scare into him. Supernatural terror added itself to his
certainty of the deadliness of the Big Gambler, Just who, Joe kept asking
himself, had he got into a game with tonight? There was curiosity and there
was dread -- a dreadful curiosity as strong as his desire to get the bones and
win. His hair rose and he was all over goose bumps, though the power was still
pulsing in his hand like a braked locomotive or a rocket wanting to lift from
the pad.<p>

     At the same time the Big Gambler stayed just that -- a black
satin-coated, slouch-hatted elegance, suave, courtly, lethal. In fact, almost
the worst thing about the spot Joe found himself in was that, after admiring
the Big Gambler's perfect sportsmanship all night, he must now be disenchanted
by his machinelike throwing and try to catch him out on any technicality he
could.<p>

     The remorseless mowing down of the Big Mushrooms went on. The empty
spaces outnumbered the Toadstools. Soon there were only three left.<p>

     The Boneyard had grown still as Cypress Hollow or the Moon. the jazz had
stopped and the gay laughter and the shuffle of feet and the squeak of goosed
girls and the clink of drinks and coins. Everybody seemed to be gathered
around the Number One Crap Table, rank on silent rank.<p>

     Joe was racked by watchfulness, sense of injustice, self-contempt, wild
hopes, curiosity and dread. Especially the last two.<p>

     The complexion of the Big Gambler, as much as you could see of it,
continued to darken. for one wild moment Joe found himself wondering if he'd
got into a game with a nigger, maybe a witchcraft-drenched Voodoo Man whose
white make-up was wearing off.<p>

     Pretty soon there came a century wager which the two remaining Big
Mushrooms couldn't fade between them. Joe had to make up a sawbuck from his
miserably tiny pile or get out of the game. After a moment's agonizing
hesitation, he did the former.<p>

     And lost his ten.<p>

     The two Big Mushrooms reeled back into the hushed crowd.<p>

     Pit-black eyes bored into Joe. A whisper: "Rolling your pile."<p>

     Joe felt well up in him the shameful impulse to confess himself licked
and run home. At least his six thousand dollars would make a hit with his Wife
and Ma.<p>

     But he just couldn't bear to think of the crowd's laughter, or the
thought of living with himself knowing that he'd had a final chance, however
slim, to challenge the Big Gambler and passed it up.<p>

     He nodded.<p>

     The Big Gambler shot. Joe leaned out over and down the table, forgetting
his vertigo, as he followed the throw with eagle or space-telescope eyes.<p>

     "Satisfied?"<p>

     Joe knew he ought to say, "Yes," and slink off with head held as high as
he could manage. It was the gentlemanly thing to do. But then he reminded
himself that he wasn't a gentleman, but just a dirty, working-stiff miner with
a talent for precision hurling.<p>

     He also knew that it was probably very dangerous for him to say anything
but, "Yes," surrounded as he was by enemies and strangers. But then he asked
himself what right had he, a miserable, mortal, homebound failure, to worry
about danger.<p>

     Besides, one of the ruby-grinning dice looked just the tiniest hair out
of line with the other.<p>

     It was the biggest effort yet of Joe's life, but he swallowed and managed
to say, "No. Lottie, the card test."<p>

     The dice-girl fairly snarled and reared up and back as if she were going
to spit in his eyes, and Joe had a feeling her spit was cobra venom. But the
Big Gambler lifted a finger at her in reproof and she skimmed the card at Joe,
yet so low and viciously that it disappeared under the black felt for an
instant before flying up into Joe's hand.<p>

     It was hot to the tough and singed a pale brown all over, though
otherwise unimpaired. Joe gulped and spun it back high.<p>

     Sneering poisoned daggers at him, Lottie let it glide down the end
wall... and after a moment's hesitation, it slithered behind the die Joe had
suspected.<p>

     A bow and then the whisper:"You have sharp eyes, sir. Undoubtedly that
die failed to reach the wall. My sincerest apologies and... your dice, sir."<p>

     Seeing the cubes sitting on the black rim in front of him almost gave Joe
apoplexy. All the feelings racking him, including his curiosity, rose to an
almost unbelievable pitch of intensity, and when he'd said, "Rolling my pile,"
and the Big Gambler had replied, "You're faded," he yielded to an
uncontrollable impulse and cast the two dice straight at the Big Gambler's
ungleaming, midnight eyes.<p>

     They went right through into the Big Gambler's skull and bounced around
inside there, rattling like big seeds in a big gourd not quite yet dry.<p>

     Throwing out a hand, palm back, to either side, to indicate that none of
his boys or girls or anyone else must make a reprisal on Joe, the Big Gambler
dryly gargled the two cubical bones, then spat them out so that they landed in
the center of the table, the one die flat, the other leaning against it.<p>

     "Cocked dice, sir," he whispered as graciously as if no indignity
whatever had been done him. "Roll again."<p>

     Joe shook the dice reflectively, getting over the shock. After a little
bit he decided that though he could now guess the Big Gambler's real name,
he'd still give him a run for his money.<p>

     A little corner of Joe's mind wondered how a live skeleton hung together.
Did the bones still have gristle and thews, were they wired, was it done with
force-fields, or was each bone a calcium magnet clinging to the next? -- this
tying in somehow with the generation of the deadly ivory electricity.<p>

     In the great hush of The Boneyard, someone cleared his throat, a Scarlet
Woman tittered hysterically, a coin fell from the nakedest change girl's tray
with a golden clink and rolled musically across the floor.<p>

     "Silence," the Big Gambler commanded and in a movement almost too fast to
follow whipped a hand inside the bosom of his coat and out to the crap table's
rim in front of him. A short-barreled silver revolver lay softly gleaming
there. "Next creature, from the humblest nigger night-girl to you, Mr. Bones,
who utters a sound while my worthy opponent rolls, gets a bullet in the head."<p>

     Joe gave him a courtly bow back, it felt funny, and then decided to start
his run with a natural seven made up of an ace and a six. He rolled and this
time the Big Gambler, judging from the movements of his skull, closely
followed the course of the cubes with his eyes that weren't there.<p>

     The dice landed, rolled over, and lay still. Incredulously, Joe realized
that for the first time in his crap-shooting life he'd made a mistake. Or else
there was a power in the Big Gambler's gaze greater than that in his own right
hand. The six cube had come down okay, but the ace had taken an extra half
roll and come down six too.<p>

     "End of the game," Mr. Bones boomed sepulchrally.<p>

     The Big Gambler raised a brown skeletal hand. "Not necessarily," he
whispered. His black eyepits aimed themselves at Joe like the mouths of siege
guns. "Joe Slattermill, you still have something of value to wager if you
wish. Your life."<p>

     At that a giggling and a hysterical tittering and a guffawing and a
braying and a shrieking burst uncontrollably out of the whole Boneyard. Mr.
Bones summed up the sentiments when he bellowed over the rest of the racket,
"Now what use or value is there in the life of a bummer like Joe Slattermill?
Not two cents, ordinary money."<p>

     The Big Gambler laid a hand on the revolver gleaming before him and all
the laughter died.<p>

     "I have a use for it," the Big Gambler whispered. "Joe Slattermill, on my
part I will venture all my winnings of tonight, and throw in the world and
everything in it for a side bet. You will wager your life, and on the side
your soul. You to roll the dice. What's your pleasure?"<p>

     Joe Slattermill quailed, but then the drama of the situation took hold of
him. He thought it over and realized he certainly wasn't going to give up
being stage center in a spectacle like this to go home broke to his Wife and
Mother and decaying house and the dispirited Mr. Guts. Maybe, he told himself
encouragingly, there wasn't a power in the Big Gambler's gaze, maybe Joe had
just made his one and only crap-shooting error. Besides, he was more inclined
to accept Mr. Bones's assessment of the value of his life than the Big
Gambler's.<p>

     "It's a bet," he said.<p>

     "Lottie, give him the dice."<p>

     Joe concentrated his mind as never before, the power tingled triumphantly
in his hand, and he made the throw.<p>

     The dice never hit the felt. They went swooping down, then up, in a crazy
curve far out over the end of the table, and then came streaking back like
tiny red-glinting meteors toward the face of the Big Gambler, where they
suddenly nested and hung in his black eye sockets, each with the single red
gleam of an ace showing.<p>

     Snake eyes.<p>

     The whisper, as those red-glinting dice-eyes stared mockingly at him:
"Joe Slattermill, you've crapped out."<p>

     Using thumb and middle finger -- or bone rather -- of either hand, the
Big Gambler removed the dice from his eye sockets and dropped them in Lottie's 
white-gloved hand.<p>

     "Yes, you've crapped out, Joe Slattermill," he went on tranquilly. "And
now you can shoot yourself" -- he touched the silver gun -- "or cut your
throat" -- he whipped out a gold-handled bowie knife out of his coat and laid
it beside the revolver -- "or poison yourself" -- the two weapons were joined
by a small black bottle with white skull and crossbones on it -- "or Miss
Flossie here can kiss you to death." He drew forward beside him his prettiest,
evilest-looking sporting girl. She preened herself and flounced her short
violet skirt and gave Joe a provocative, hungry look, lifting her carmine
upper lip to show her long white canines.<p>

     "Or else," the Big Gambler added, nodding significantly toward the
black-bottomed crap table, "you can take the Big Dive."<p>

     Joe said evenly, "I'll take the Big Dive."<p>

     He put his right foot on his empty chip table, his left on the black rim,
fell forward... and suddenly kicking off from the rim, launched himself in a
tiger spring straight across the crap table at the Big Gambler's throat,
solacing himself with the thought that certainly the poet chap hadn't seemed
to suffer long.<p>

     As he flashed across the exact center of the table he got an instant
photograph of what really lay below, but his brain had no time to develop that
snapshot, for the next instant he was plowing into the Big Gambler.<p>

     Stiffened brown palm edge caught him in the temple with a lightninglike
judo chop... and the brown fingers or bones flew all apart like puff paste.
Joe's left hand went through the Big Gambler's chest as if there were nothing
there but black satin coat, while his right hand, straight-armedly clawing at
the slouch-hatted skull, crunched it to pieces. Next instant Joe was sprawled
on the floor with some black clothes and brown fragments.<p>

     He was on his feet in a flash and snatching at the Big Gambler's tall
stacks. He had time for one left-handed grab. He couldn't see any gold or
silver or any black chips, so he stuffed his left pants pocket with a handful
of the pale chips and ran.<p>

     Then the whole population of The Boneyard was on him and after him.
Teeth, knives and brass knuckles flashed. He was punched, clawed, kicked,
tripped and stamped on with spike heels. A gold-plated trumpet with a
bloodshot-eyed black face behind it bopped him on the head. He got a white
flash of the golden dice-girl and made a grab for her, but she got away.
Someone tried to mash a lighted cigar in his eye. Lottie, writhing and
flailing like a white boa constrictor, almost got a simultaneous strangle hold
and scissors on him. From a squat wide-mouth bottle Flossie, snarling like a
feline fiend, threw what smelt like acid past his face. Mr. Bones peppered
shots around him from the silver revolver. He was stabbed at, gouged,
rabbit-punched, scragmauled, slugged, kneed, bitten, bearhugged, butted,
beaten and had his toes trampled.<p>

     But somehow none of the blows or grabs had much real force. It was like
fighting ghosts. In the end it turned out that the whole population of The
Boneyard, working together, had just a little more strength than Joe. He felt
himself being lifted by a multitude of hands and pitched out through the
swinging doors so that he thudded down on his rear end on the board sidewalk.
Even that didn't hurt much. It was more like a kick of encouragement.<p>

     He took a deep breath and felt himself over and worked his bones. He
didn't seem to have suffered any serious damage. He stood up and looked
around. The Boneyard was dark and silent as the grave, or the planet Pluto, or
all the rest of Ironmine. As his eyes got accustomed to the starlight and
occasional roving spaceship-gleam, he saw a padlocked sheet-iron door where
the swinging ones had been.<p>

     He found he was chewing on something crusty that he'd somehow carried in
his right hand all the way through the final fracas. Mighty tasty, like the
bread his Wife baked for best customers. At that instant his brain developed
the photograph it had taken when he had glanced down as he flashed across the
center of the crap table. It was a thin wall of flames moving sideways across
the table and just beyond the flames the faces of his Wife, Mother, and Mr.
Guts, all looking very surprised. He realized that what he was chewing was a
fragment of the Big Gambler's skull, and he remembered the shape of the three
loaves his Wife had started to bake when he left the house. And he understood
the magic she'd made to let him get a little ways away and feel half a man,
and then come diving home with his fingers burned.<p>

     He spat out what was in his mouth and pegged the rest of the bit of
giant-popover skull across the street.<p>

     He fished in his left pocket. Most of the pale poke chips had been mashed
in the fight, but he found a whole one and explored its surface with his
fingertips. The symbol embossed on it was a cross. He lifted it to his lips and
took a bite. It tasted delicate, but delicious. He ate it and felt his
strength revive. He patted his bulging left pocket. At least he'd start out
well provisioned.<p>

     Then he turned and headed straight for home, but he took the long way,
around the world.<p>
