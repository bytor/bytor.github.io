This cd boot is the exact same as "Live in Toronto 1986" but unlike it,
doesn't have any pictures of Rush in the booklet, simply some computerized
simulation of Mona Lisa. It is merely a copy of the GUP video
soundtrack, with some songs cut out, and two extra songs from the ESL video
soundtrack ("Freewill" & "Limelight") added in. It is also the same as Life
Under Pressure, although it contains "Limelight" which the Life boot does 
not.<p>

The sound quality, coming directly from a video soundtrack, is of course
generally excellent. However, occasionally the sound in the right channel will
drop out, and the crowd can seem overpowering at times though, especially if
listening to the disc on headphones. The dropouts do become annoying later in
the disc.<p>

There is no packaging to speak of, but miraculously enough all the songs are
listed correctly.<p>

Between this and the two others listed above, "Live in Toronto" would be the
best choice to get. The dropouts make this disc pretty much unlistenable.<p>
