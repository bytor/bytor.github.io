<font size=+1>New to States, Rush is off to flying start</font><br>
<b>by Jim Knippenberg</b><p>

The topic today is heavy metal. Loud, screechin' and screamin', bone
crunching and back breaking heavy metal.
<p>
Rush is the name and you may have seen them two weeks ago at the Gardens with
Uriah Heep. If you didn't, well, just try it the next time out. Because the
band is a fine show.
<p>
Rush is a three man group from Canada, operating more or less in the Cream or
original Grand Funk tradition. Three men exploring every possible sound with
guitar, bass and drums.
<p>
They've been together six years, hanging out mainly in Ontario. American
audiences are catching their first glimpse with an album called "Rush"
(Mercury) and in a few carefully selected concert halls. They did four dates
with Uriah Heep. Coming are dates with Blue Oyster Cult, PFM and Rory
Gallagher.
<p>
While in Cincinnati, Geddy Lee, the group's bassist and lead vocalist, talked
about a few of the things happening right now to Rush.
<p>
"This is the fourth day of our first American tour, so we're still sort of
settling into things. Mercury has sort of swept us off our feet lately."
<p>
To be sure, Mercury signed the group some 24 hours after first hearing them --
unheard of in this "wait and see" business -- rush released the first album
and chased them onto the first tour all within a matter of weeks.
<p>
"I think maybe because of the luck they were having with BTO. Not that we're
anything alike, they just seem to like heavy Canadians right now.
<p>
"It's strange hearing this album they've released. We did it almost two years
ago and although I'm pleased with it, it's sort of old to me. I see it from a
different standpoint."
<p>
The album in question here is a loud, very fast and hard rocking metal thing
("I don't like 'metal.' We need a new name," Lee says), which lives up to the
group's name, Rush. It is that.
<p>
It's a simple sound, as is most metal, based on the interplay between the
three instruments. Guitar and bass dominate with drums only slightly in the
background. Also like most metal, we're going here for the effect through the
sound generated by all three players. Not for any development through single
instruments or any of the solo work.
<p>
Unlike most metal, and here's where the group excels, Rush is not working with
the same three or four basic sounds, masquerading the same riffs and playing
them over and over again. Instead, it's a more polished sound, complete with
the variety you hardly ever find in heavy metal.
<p>
Especially the vocals. Lee sings them with the same touch of drama you hear
in Alice Cooper vocals. That "I'll die or sing it approach." On some of the
cuts he's a screamer, on others a singer. On all of them keying his voice to
the acrobatics of the music. A difficult chore, considering some of the riffs
doing down here.
<p>
Lee himself seems to think the album's strong point is the tightness coming
from the fact that there's only three of them playing. Add to that the
variations explored within the format -- three people sounding like five. Add
also the various skills on the chosen instruments. And the ease and comfort
with which most of the music is presented.
<p>
The only weakness with all of this has to do with the lyrics. They could use
some polish. And a little variety. Perhaps some getting away from the "love is
the thing" and "let's boogie" thing for a time.
<p>
But they're secondary, as with all metal groups. The important thing here is
the music. Loud, hard, driving, painful if you want it to be, all bursting
with living and loving.
<p>
There's a second Rush album due sometime in the winter. With, Lee promised,
"some slightly different music, improved lyrics. Still more variety. But still
in a three man -- no, having only three people isn't restrictive at all --
format."
<p>
Okay. So the first one's a little rough around the edges. Still in need of
that final, gelled sound. It's still all full of natural talents and raw
energy and sounding just fine. Which is a pretty good start.<p>
