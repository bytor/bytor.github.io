<em>September 23, 1991</em>
<p>

He's got a coupon for Folgers<br>
caffine fix for the week<br>
Heads for the sugar<br>
She grabs a liquid crystal cleanser<br>
Places the Apple Jacks<br>
Under the Velveeta<p>

They travel in the isle of the can goods<br>
On a buying spree, straight to the Del Monte Beans<br>
Like Libbys and Campbells<br>
And the cheapest brand of all of these<br>
We only go home when the shopping's done, shopping's done<p>

He buys a star quiz of Capricorns<br>
A box of roach motels<br>
Makes his way to the deli<br>
She's got a rebate for Oreo's<br>
A promise of a discount price<br>
On the roast and the sirloin<p>

They travel to the produce section<br>
fresh out of the grapes today<br>
next to the rasin display<br>
Like apples and oranges<br>
Buying the last of the alar stains<br>
We only go home when we're on the way, on the way<p>

We aren't done<br>
Wandering the front of the store<br>
Wondering what we came here for<br>
Learning that were only forgetful<br>
For a limited time<p>

Kraft is a free Dodge Caravan<br>
Goes away in the night<br>
their lawyers leave you in dreamland<br>
Clorox is a white bleach cleaner<br>
Flicker of flouresent lights<br>
Left behind in the fast lane<p>

We travel to the checkout scanner<br>
A laser reader traces the barcode lines<br>
Like magic and wonder<br>
checking for the lowest price<br>
We only go home when we're satisfied, satisfied<p>

We aren't done<br>
Wandering the front of the store<br>
Wondering what we came here for<br>
Learning that were only forgetful<br>
For a limited time<p>

We travel back from our grocery adventure<br>
On the busy highway straight to the place we call home<br>
Like others before us<br>
through the worst part of the neighborhood<br>
We only get home when we're in the drive, in the drive<p>
