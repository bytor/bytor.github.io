<font size=+1>Boise fans get a concert 'Rush'</font><br>
<b>by Steve Martin</b><p>
BOISE -- Sixteen hours of music was rolled up into a satisfying three
when the three-man Canadian band Rush played the Boise State
University Pavilion Monday night. <p>

Lead singer/bass guitarist/synthesizer player Geddy Lee predicted the
long set when he, electrical/acoustic guitarist Alex Lifeson and
drummer Neal Peart leaped on stage to kick things off with
"Dreamline," off 1991's "Roll the Bones." <p>

Six years later, the popular power rock trio has proven that the dream is
still alive. <p>

Rush's 20th album, "Test for Echo," has the band again filling U.S.
and Canadian arenas. Here in the Treasure Valley, 5,714 fans turned
out to catch the band's Pavilion concert. <p>

Rush performed nearly 30 songs during the energy-driven show, most
coming from "Test for Echo." Of the new offerings, most appealing
were the title track; "Driven," which featured a guitar solo by Lee; the
somber-sounding "Half the World;" the rock ballad "Resist;" and a
pleasant instrumental called "Limbo." <p>

The rest of the show was laced with 23 years worth of Rush classics
that still sounded sweet when played live. Selections included "Roll the
Bones," "Limelight," "Force Ten," "Closer to the Heart," "Freewill,"
"Nobody's Hero" and "Tom Sawyer." <p>

Most songs were accompanied by a cascade of lights and a jumble of
video images projected onto a big screen behind the band. The stage
was a simple affair with only a few props that included "satellite" light
projectors and two towering rigs adorned with globes of the earth. <p>

But while fans cheered after recognizing one of their favorites about to
be played, it was the "down" time that was most appreciated. <p>

Both Lifeson and Peart performed solo sets -- Peart jammed away on
his drums and other percussion instruments for nearly 15 minutes alone
-- and both received standing ovations. <p>

One overenthusiastic fan was literally carried out the exit near the
show's end after he somehow evaded Pavilion security, leaped onto the
stage and then jumped into the floor crowd. <p>

Neither Lee, Peart or Lifeson seemed fazed by the intrusion, though,
launching right into the show's climax number, "Tom Sawyer." <p>

It just goes to prove what Rush fans already knew. These three guys
are pros at what they do -- making music.<p>
