<font size=+1><strong>On the cover of All The World's a Stage</font>
</strong><br><br>
<dd><em>All The World's A Stage is a pretty straight-forward cover, except 
that the original pressings of the album came with a triple gatefold 
jacket.</em> <P>

<strong>Hugh Syme (<a href="../HTML/articles/creem83.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/creem83.html">Creem, 1983</a>): </strong>"Yes, well, that was during the 
hiatus of outrageous packaging.  As I said,
AGI in Chicago did all of Rush's printing then, up until about four years ago.
Albums like Ooh La La by the Faces, and Physical Graffiti-all of that was
going on then, so we thought we'd go for a six panel jacket."</dd></dl>

<font size=+1><strong>Why did Rush put out a live album?</font></strong><br><br>
<dl><dd>
<strong>Neil Peart (<a href="../HTML/articles/circus1176.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/circus1176.html">Circus, 
November 25th 1976</a>): </strong>
  "With <strong>2112</strong>, we felt we had reached a first plateau. We had
realized
the goals we set for ourselves before the second album [when Peart
replaced the band's former drummer, John Rutsey]. Musically, it looked
like a logical place to do a live album. We had four albums' worth of
material honed down to a live show. And the record company was hot for a
live album." <p>
  Peart feels that the live album will help present a more accurate
picture of where the band is currently at.<p>
  "When we play a piece live, we add all our little quirks to it. It
grows; our older material shows a remarkable progression. Some of the old
songs have developed until they're superior to the originals. This gives
us a chance to bring them up to date. We always felt there was something
happening live that didn't come across on record. Now we have the
opportunity to capture that essence of the band.<p>
  "Also, <strong>All the World's a Stage</strong> presents our material to
people who
may have heard or liked a couple of our songs, but never got into all our
albums. Now they can have those songs together on one album without our
having to put out a <strong>Best of Rush</strong> package."
