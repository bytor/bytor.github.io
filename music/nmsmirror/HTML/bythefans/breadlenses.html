I see Fred<br>
he's gettin' outta bed<br>
could he have smelled somethin'<br>
like fresh-baked bread?<p>

Should I have crushed rye or whole wheat<br>
or just a burger bun<br>
these bagels weigh a ton<p>

the baker's oven<br>
the blueberry muffin<br>
I want bread! uh-oh here comes Fred.<p>

Couldn't he get some without using mine instead?<p>

I said bread bread,<br>
Chewin' around the crust now<br>
and puttin it on my head<br>
Shouldn't we toast it first is what Fred said.<p>

We've got rye on the mind's-eye now<br>
says the passionate midnight snack(er)<br>
(with Jam!)<br>
what you spread on comes from a jar<br>
a loaf left to confuse, baguettes are just the ruse<br>
for Fred. He's eatin' my bread.<p>

cursing at him; thoughtless. bread ahead!<p>

And the yeast it is a-rising<br>
the bread it starts to fall<br>
oh no i ruined it all!<br>
The bread it is burning<br>
and me I am learning<br>
to bake bread! Inside my homestead.<p>

You see black and burnt<br>
but I see bread. Bread!<br>
not for you<p>

i'm thinkin about the recipe<br>
that I just read<p>

Said I want bread bread<br>
I'm thinkin of shootin that darn Fred<br>
Always, always, out of bread<p>
