<strong>
<em>
SCISSORS, PAPER, STONE</em></strong>
<br><br>
<font size=-1>by Neil Peart</font>
</center><br><br><br>

   Writing a story about making a record is like making a record; you never
get it quite right, so you keep trying. In the past I've talked about the
studios, the people we've worked with, the weather, our methods of work --
lots about what we do, but nothing about <strong>why</strong> we do it, and nothing about how
the songs themselves develop. So maybe it's time to try a glass-bottom boat
on those murky waters.<p>

   One of those French guys, Balzac or Flaubert, said that a novel should be
applies to songwriting as well. "Reflecting on life" could certainly be the
unifying theme of Rush's odyssey through the years -- though of course we
never thought of it at the time. We were too busy moving down the road, as
most people are. But at least when you're moving fast, you have to look
<strong>ahead</strong>; there's only time for a quick glance in the rear-view, just to make
sure no flashing red lights are gaining.  Otherwise it's no good dwelling
on what's behind you. Just your own tailights.<p>

   To belabor the metaphor in a general sense:  all of us are moving down
that road with <strong>different</strong> mirrors, and we don't just 
<strong>reflect</strong> life, we
<strong>respond</strong> to it.  We filter things through our own lenses, and respond
according to our temperaments and moods.   As the Zen farmer says:  "That's
why they make different-colored neckties."<p>

   That's why they make different-sounding music too.  To beat another
metaphor into submission: in musical terms Rush is not so much a mirror,
but a satellite dish moving down the road, soaking up different styles,
methods, and designs.  When the time comes to work on new songs, you turn on
the satellite descrambler, unfilter your lenses, activate the manure
detector, check the rear-view mirror, and try desperately to unmix your
metaphors.<p>

   When the three of us start working on a new record, we have NO idea
what we'll come up with.  There is only the desire to do it, and the
confidence that we can.  The uneasiness of starting from nothing is
dissipated by the first song or two, but still the mystery remains -- in the
truest sense, <strong>we don't know what we're doing</strong>.  We know it seems right; we know
that it's what we want to do at that point in time, but we don't know
what it adds up to.  And often we <strong>won't</strong> know for a long time -- until well
after the record has been released and everyone else has had their say
about it.  Then it seems to crystallize in our own minds, and we develop of
little objectivity about it -- what we're pleased with, and where it could
have been better.<p>

   And that's where progression comes in -- where it could have been
better.  As a band and as individuals, we always have a hidden agenda, a
subtext of motivation which is based on dissatisfaction with past work, and
desire to improve.  That agenda has changed as we have changed; when we
started out, we just wanted to learn how to <strong>play</strong>, and sometimes our songs
were just vehicles for technical experiments and the Joy of Indulgence.
But still, <strong>playing</strong> is the foundation for us -- the Stone -- and rock is our
favorite kind of stone.  Despite our dabbles in other styles, it is the
energy, flexibility, and attitude of rock which remain most compelling for
us.  We exercised our fingers and exorcized our demons by trying every note
we could reach, in every time signature we could count on our fingers.  But
after we'd played with those toys for awhile, the songs themselves began to
attract our interest.  Rock is not made of Stone alone, and we wanted to
learn more about conveying what <strong>we</strong> felt as powerfully as we could.  Paper
wraps Stone -- the song contains they playing, gives it structure and
meaning.<p>

   More experiments resulted as we pursued that goal, and those
experiments had to lead us into the field of arrangement.  Once we felt
more satisfied with the pieces of the songs, and how we played them as
individuals and as a band, it became more important how we assembled the
pieces.  Scissors cut Paper -- the arrangement shapes the songs, gives it
focus and balance.  So our last few albums have relected that interest,
tinkering with melodic and rhythmic structure in pursuit of the best
possible <strong>interpretation</strong> of the song.<p>

   All of these qualities -- arrangement, composition, and musicianship --
add up to one thing:  presentation. Beyond the idea, presentation is
everything, and must take that spark of <strong>possibility</strong>, the idea, from
inner-ear potential to a realized work. In an ideal song, music conveys
the feeling and lyrics the thought.  Some overlap is desirable -- you want
ideas in the music and emotion in the lyrics -- but the voice often carries
that burden, the job of wedding the thoughts and feelings. Since the goal
of those thoughts and feelings is to reach the listener, and hopefully be
responded to, success depends on the best possible balance of structure,
song, and skill. Scissors, paper, stone. Where once we concentrated on each
of them more-or-less exclusively, now we like to think that each element
has been stored in the "tool box," and we're trying to learn how to juggle
them all at once (though juggling scissors can be damned unpleasant).<p>

   At the same time, Rush's hidden agenda has a wide scope. The
presentation of our music has to accomplish several demands: it has to be
all the above, plus it must be intersting, and challenging to play, and
remain satisfying in the long term -- when we play it night after night on
the road. The recording must be captured as well as men and machines
possibly can, and thus be satisfying to listen to, as well as fit to stand
as the "benchmark" performance, the one we'll try to recrate on each of
those stages.<p>

   Before making <strong>Presto</strong> we had left those stages behind for a while. At
the end of the <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> tour we put together the live album and
video, <strong>A Show Of Glands</strong> -- I mean <strong>Hands</strong>. Because we were just about to
sign with a different record company, Atlantic, we found ourselves free of
deadlines and obligations -- for the first time in fifteen years -- so we
decided to make the most of that. We took some time off, got to know
ourselves and our families once again, and generally just backed away from
the infectious machinery of Rash -- I mean Rush.<p>

   This was a good and important thing, although it was one of the few
times in our history when the future was in doubt -- none of us really knew
what would happen next. After that six-month hiatus, when Geddy and Alex
came over to my house to discuss our future, there was no sense of
<strong>compulsion</strong> about it -- it was simply a question of what 
<strong>we</strong> wanted to do.
And, we decided, what <strong>we</strong> wanted to do was make another record. The reasons
remain elusive, but the motivation seems obvious: something to do with
another chance to express ourselves, to try to communicate what interests
us in words and music, and, simplest of all, a chance to 
<strong>play</strong>. In both
senses. Without any obligations on us, we found we were still excited about
making music together, and truly wanted to make something new.<p>

   For <strong>Presto</strong>, like all of our records in recent years, we started with a
trip to the country. We rented a house with a small studio at one end, a
desk at the other, and all the usual stuff in the middle. During the bright
winter afternoons, Geddy and Alex worked in the studio, developing musical
ideas on a portable recording setup, while I sat at my desk in the other
end, staring out at the snow-covered trees and rewriting lyrics. At the end
of the day I might wander into the studio, ice cubes clinking, and listen
to what they'd been up to, and if I'd been lucky, show them something new.
It was the perfect situation; isolated, yet near enough Toronto that we
could commute home for the weekends, and with the studio and house
connected, whenever we had ideas to share we could run from end to end with
tapes and bits of paper.<p>

   Personally, this is my favorite part of everything we do: just the three
of us and a couple of guys to keep the equipment running. We have nothing
else to worry about but writing new songs, and making them as good as we
can. With few distractions, we can concentrate on the work, and also feel
the reward: the excitement of creating things, of responding to each
other's ideas, and the instant gratification of putting brand-new songs
down on tape. At this time we get the <strong>real</strong> feedback from our work; it's new
enough to be as exciting for us as we hope it will be for the listener.<p>

   And that is where a coproducer comes into the picture. Peter Collins,
who worked with us on <strong>Power Windows</strong> and <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>, told us that he
felt his own career needed more variety and scope, and reluctantly bowed out
of our next album. By this time we had learned how to make a record
ourselves if we wanted to, but we still wanted an Objective Ear, someone
whose judgment and ideas we could trust. Once we'd sorted out the paper and
stone, we wanted someone to help with the scissors.<p>

   Of a few different candidates, Rupert Hine was the one we decided on.
Rupert is a songwriter, singer, and keyboard player in his own right, and
has made about fifteen albums himself, in addition to producing seventy-odd
records, for other people, like Tina Turner, Howard Jones, and The Fixx.
All this experience, combined with his ideas and enthusiasm, made Rupert's
input valuable, particularly in the area of keyboard and vocal arrangements.
We were a little bemused when we first played the songs for him, and at the
end of some of them he actually seemed to be <strong>laughing</strong>! We looked at each
other, eyebrows raised as if to say: "He thinks our songs are <strong>funny</strong>?" But
evidently it was a laugh of pleasure; he stayed 'til the end.<p>

  For the past eight years Rupert and engineer Stephen Tayler have worked
together as a production team, and at Rupert's urging, we brought Stephen
in to work behind the console. As an engineer Stephen was fast, decisive,
enthusiastic, and always able to evoke the desired sound, while his
unfailing good humore, like Ruper's, contributed to making <strong>Presto</strong> the
most relaxed sessions we've enjoyed in years. But it was as a volleyball
player that Stephen really shone, unanimously voted "rookie of the year" in
our midnight games at Le Studio.<p>

   A long day's work behind us, we gathered outside, charged by the cool
air of early summer in the Laurentians. We doused ourselves with bug
repellant, then gathered on the floodlit grass, took our sides, and
preformed a kind of St. Vitus Dance to shake off the mosquitoes.
Occasionally one of us hit the ball in the right direction -- but not
often. Mostly it was punched madly toward the lake, or missed completely,
to trickle away into the dark and scary woods. ("That's okay; I'll get
it.") We were as amused by Rupert's efforts at volleyball as he'd been by
our songs, but indeed, all of us had our moments -- laughter contributed
more to the game than skill. And if the double-distilled French
refreshments subtracted from our skill, they added to our laughter.<p>

   Between games the shout went up: "Drink!", and obediently we ran to the
line of brandy glasses on the porch. Richard the Raccoon poked his masked
face out from beneath the stairs, wanting to know what all the noise was
about. "Richard!" we shouted, and the poor frightened beastie ran back
under the steps, adn we ran laughing back onto the court. The floodlights
silvered the grass, an island of light set apart from the world, like a
stage.<p>

   On this stage, however, we leave out the drive for excellence; no
pressure from within, no expectations from others. Mistakes are not a
curse, but cause for laughter, and on this stage, the play's the thing --
we can forget that we also have to <strong>work</strong> together.<p>

   Work together, play together, frighten small mammals together: Are we
having fun yet? Yes, we are. And <strong>that</strong>, now that I think about it, is why we
do what we do, and why we keep doing it: We have fun together. How boring
it would be if we didn't. Not only that, but we work well together too,
balancing each other like a three-sided mirror, each reflecting a different
view, but all moving down the road together. As the Zen farmer says: "Life
is like the scissors-paper-stone game: None of the answers is 
<strong>always</strong> right, but each one sometimes is."<br><br><br>

ALEX LIFESON</font><p>

   After taking a long break from touring, I started thinking about setting
up a new system that was different from what I had been using during the
last few tours. It occurred to me that perhaps I should consider using
equipment manufactured in a country on the leading edge of this technology,
and in the spirit of perestroika and glasnost decided that the Soviet Union
was just the place. I arrived in Moscow and made my way to the local music
shop: "Large Fun Music Store," and spoke to the salescomrade about the
latest in musical equipment.<p>

   "First ting, you are coming to right place. Second ting, I give you best
deal dis side of Leningrad and I want you to know I'm losing rubles on dis
deal. Nobody can ever say Yuri Leestiniki try to rip dem up."<p>

   Feeling assured that I wasn't getting rubble for my ruble, I asked Yuri
to show me what he had in the way of guitars. He returned ten minutes
later with the strangest guitar case I'd ever seen. It was quite flat and
about a half meter square, made of plywood with a long nail hammered into
the top and bent over to use for a carrying handle.<p>

   "Dis is last model in whole Soviet Union and was sold to guy from Kiev
but he never call me back today, so even because I will to get in trouble,
I will sell to you."<p>

   What a deal, I thought.<p>

   "Okay Yuri," I said, "let's have a look at it."<p>

   Yuri opened the case by prying with two screw drivers at either end and
keeping his foot firmly on the 'carrying nail.' When he finally got it
opened, there was this...this thing. It sort of looked like the shape of a
guitar but in place of the pickups were these magnets like we used to have
in school with the red-painted ends, and in place of a volume control was
an on/off switch that looked as if it had come out of a household fuse
panel.<p>

   Oh yeah, it didn't have a neck.<p>

   "Oh, you are wanting neck too?" he said, surprised. "Neck is extra but I
can order for you one to be here in four to six month. Maybe."<p>

   "Okay," I said, "forget the guitar for now. What about amplifiers?"<p>

   "Best amplifier in world I have in stock right now. Is called a "Khrumy"
and it come already wit speaker. Is new modren design and also is good for
heavy-metal sound because is made from pure and complete iron. You are
first to solder wires into electric plug on wall in house and after to
maybe stand back for maybe one minutes. Is good to wear big orange rubber
gloves when making amplifier to work. Is good amp but sometimes someting is
maybe breaking, and so is good buying one more amplifier for spare part. Is
nice green color, don't you tink?"<p>

   Yes, well. I asked about the price anyway, thinking that it could make a
decent fridge at least.<p>

   "If you have to ask, you are not affording it," he answered me. "But I
am liking you and we are just finish a big sale. Dis is last day as matter
of fact. I must to be crazy but I let it go for...aah...eight tousand
rubles."<p>

   "<strong>What!?</strong>" I screamed.<p>

   "Okay, okay. How about two pair of jeans and maybe some sandwich."<p>

   The amp came with wheels and a small thirty-horsepower motor, so after I
paid Yuri and we got the motor started, I said goodbye and he reminded me
to fill in the warranty card for the ten-day warranty. I drove the amp back
to the airport and headed home.<p>

   I arrived home and was excited to get the amp plugged in and hear it. I
got out the soldering gun, soldered the wires into the receptacle, stood
back for one minute...and my house burned down.<p>

   You know, I kinda liked my <strong>old</strong> gear.<p>

Thurs. Jan 18th -- 10:25 a.m.<br>
Subject: A Kwipment Lisp<p>

   Yes, I've just received a fax (what a modrin world) from my Pal Pratt
(pardon my French) requesting this year's equipment list. Sounds exciting,
doesn't it? An equipment list. Just rolls off the tongue. Oh boy!
Equipment. You mean equipment for performance? Equipment for living on the
road? Well, how about things I need. Or things I love. Nope! Too small a
space. A list or is it liszt or at least, er, excuse me -- I guess I'm
wanted back on the planet Earth. Does it sound like I'm stalling? Or trying
to shirk my responsibilities? It <strong>does</strong>? I apologize. Where were we? Lists.
Ah yes, what I use. Well, I use a Wal and a Leica R5, some big amps and a
Wilson Profile (what a profile!). Some black jeans and shoes. (It's so hard
to find good shoes isn't it?) I now have a Mizuno Liteflex glove and lots
of Roland stuff (especially samplers!...<strong>love</strong> those samplers 
-- <strong>need</strong> those
samplers. Once again I've been Saved By Technology).<p>

   I also use the sports section of <strong>USA Today</strong>. I 
<strong>need</strong> that daily! I also
use Jack Secret, John Irving, W.P. Kinsella, W.C. Fields, Skip G., Pedro
Almodovar, Modigliani, Andre Kertesz, Sandy Koufax, Diego Giacometti
(sorry, dreaming again) and obviously Woody Allen, M. Joe, B. Mink,
sweaters by Loucas (just <strong>tell</strong> me if this is going too 
<strong>far</strong>). Okay -- I also
have some Fender Basses; that's equipment!! And one N. Young and Julian W.
and some Steinbergers and Snidermans and...<p>

   Oh...have I run out of time? But there's so much more...oh well...next
time...Peace and save the planet!<p>

   Don't be fooled, these are <strong>not</strong> new drums. Nope, they're the same Ludwigs
as last time, the ones that <strong>used</strong> to be pinkish, only now they're a dark,
plummy sort of purplish color. (Beautifully done by Paintworks).<p>

   Cymbals are all by Avedis Zildjian, except for the Chinese Wuhans, and
the brass-plated hardware is a hybrid of what-have-you: Ludwig, Tama,
Pearl, Premier, and some custom-made bits from the Percussion Center in
Fort Wayne. The gong bass drum comes from Tama, and the cowbells come from
Guernsey & Holstein. Sticks are Promark 747, and heads -- always subject to
change, just like human ones -- are some combination or other of Remo and
Evans. I just keep changing my mind -- and my heads.<p>

   Same with snare drums. That remains an open question, but I'm sure to
using <strong>some</strong> combination of my old reliable Slingerland, a Solid Percussion
piccolo, an old Camco, and/or a Ludwig 13" piccolo (cute little thing).<p>

   The electronics are triggered by d-drum pads and Shark foot pedals,
driving a Yamaha midi controller and an Akai S900 sampler. A KAT
midi-marimba drives another Akai for all the keyboard percussion parts and
various effects.<p>

   You know, I was thinking about what my drum kit would look like if I had
all the <strong>real</strong> instruments up there, rather than a box full of floppy disks
and a couple of samplers. Picture a stage which contained (in addition to
<strong>that</strong> little ol' drumset): temple blocks, orchestra bells, bell tree,
glockenspiel, marimba, various African drums (including ones like 'djembe'
that I don't even know what it <strong>looks</strong> like), three tympani, a full symphony
orchestra, a 'beeper,' a big gong, harp, synthesizer, congas, bongos,
another timbale, castanets, voice-drums (recorded drum sounds vocalized by
MOI) a big huge sheet of metal, jackhammer, wood block, claves, jingled
coins, my old red Tama drumkit, and Count Basie and his band.<p>

   Oh sure, it would <strong>look</strong> great alright, but honestly -- where would I put
all that stuff? And where would the other two guys stand?<p>

   Yeah, you're right; I don't need those guys anyway.<p>
