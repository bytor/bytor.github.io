<em>Fellow Drummers:</em>
<p>
    I have recently put together a new drumset for myself (about which more
will appear in the next issue of MD), and I'm starting to feel like I have
too many good drums just sitting around. (You should have such problems,
right?) Now, I'm not greedy, and all these drums are more than I really
need. If I have one drumkit for touring and recording, and one at home for
practice and recreation, what use can I possibly have for all these others?
The answer, I've decided, is none; thus, I have decided to give the extra
ones away.
<p>
    Some of you may recall that a few years ago I gave away a nice Tama kit
by means of an essay contest here in MD. This worked out quite well, as I
was able to choose a deserving winner by way of his words, and he in turn
was generous enough to pass his drums along to the person I chose as
runner-up. The only trouble was that I had to read 4,625 essays, which took
up rather a large portion of my holidays! It was more than I bargained for,
I'd have to say, though I'm glad I did it -- once!
<p>
    So this time, I put my ideas together with the people here at MD, and
we decided to do it a little differently. We would like to hear a taped
drum performance from you. We have determined a limit of two minutes, to be
recorded on a cassette tape, in which you can express what you feel is your
best work. If you wish to make it shorter, that's fine (we judges won't
mind!), but please don't bother to make it longer, as we judges won't be
listening!
<p>
    Recording quality will not be taken into account, so don't worry too
much about that. We will be looking for things like originality, technique,
structure, imagination, musicality -- the intangible qualities that
together make a good musician. Play any style, any approach you like; there
are no limitations save your own (and the two-minute one!)
<p>
    So give it your best thought, give it your best shot, and put it in the
mail slot. (This guy writes lyrics?) We await your entries with open ears.
<p>
    <strong><u>First Prize</u></strong> - One Candy Apple Red Tama kit (the prototype 
Artstar shells), with two 24" bass drums, 6", 8", 10", and 12" concert toms, and
12", 13", 15", and 18" toms. All the drums have brass-plated hardware.
There is also the "satellite" kit consisting of an 18" bass drum, four
matching red Simmons pads, and a Simmons SDS 5 module. Oh all right, I'll
throw in a 13" wood-shell timbale and a 22" gong bass drum, too. (This
setup was used in the recording of <strong>Power Windows</strong>, 
<strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong>, and <strong>Signals</strong>, as well 
as the subsequent tours.)
<p>
    <strong><u>Second Prize</u></strong> - One Black Chrome Slingerland kit, with two 24" bass
drums, 6", 8", 10", and 12" concert toms, 12", 13", 15", and 18" toms, and
a pair of 13" and 14" brass timbales. (This kit was used in the recording
of <strong>A Farewell To Kings</strong> and <strong>Hemispheres</strong>, and 
the endless tours which followed them!)
<p>
    <strong><u>Third Prize</u></strong> - One Chrome Slingerland kit, with two 22" 
bass drums, 6", 8", 10", and 12" concert toms (copper finish), two 13" toms, 
one 14" tom, a 16" floor tom, and a chrome timbale. (Used in the recording of 
<strong>Fly By Night</strong>, <strong>Caress Of Steel</strong>, <strong>2112
</strong>, <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong>, and on those
equally endless tours.)
<p>
    All the kits are complete with basic mounting hardware and heads, and
even a few stands as well. I'm sorry there are no snare drums for any of
the kits, but I'm keeping the one snare that all those kits had in common!
(Some things you just can't replace!)
<p>
    To quote once again from one of the entrants in the last contest: "Good
luck is when preparation meets opportunity."
<p>
    So, Good Luck!
<p>
<dt>Yours truly,
<dt><em>Neil Peart</em>
