<strong><font size=+2>COUNTERPARTS</font></strong><br>
<em> reflections in a wilderness of mirrors</em><br><br>
<font size=-1>by Neil Peart</font><br><br>
</center>

In 1994 Rush will celebrate twenty years together (our rhinestone anniversary,
I believe it's called).  But really, can you imagine-the same three guys 
staying together through a score of years, and finding an audience to keep 
buying all that racket?  I'm not sure which is more amazing, but either way 
it must be some kind of record, and either way, we're happy.  That's the 
secret, if there is one.<p>

"Wilderness of mirrors" is a phrase from T.S.Eliot's "<a
href="../rush-related/gerontion.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/rush-related/gerontion.html">Gerontion</a>," and was also
applied by former CIA counterintelligence chief James Jesus Angleton to 
describe the world of espionage-hence the twist on "Double Agent," reflecting
the clandestine workings of dreams and the subconcious.  Disinformation or
intelligence?  Let the mirror decide.<p>

<strong><em>Reflections in a wilderness of mirrors;</strong></em> a kind of 
theme.  Not reflections in the
conventional sense of looking back -- certainly one can also reflect upon the 
present and future -- but more in holding a mirror up to our hidden selves, to 
human nature and its doings in the world, and to the tradgedies and 
inspirations of everyday life.  Heavy stuff, I suppose, but that doesn't mean 
we can't have fun with it!  That's the secret, if there is one.<p>

We had outlined a few goals before we began working on this record, but only
in the most casual way; conversations in the tuning room, the tour bus, or some
hotel bar.  Generally, we would continue to aim for a balance between 
spontaneity and refinement (natural complements and not adversaries, as some 
would have it), and perhaps work on a more <strong>organic</strong> approach 
to the songs -- guitar, bass, drums.  Our true counterparts.<p>

Other than these vague notions, we began with the usual "clean sheet of paper,"
the mindset that we try to bring to every new project.  So now we began to
ransack the world for producers and engineers to help shape whatever music
might emerge when we began writing.  We checked out the field of young talent,
new people who were doing interesting work, but it soon became apparent that 
<strong>we</strong>
had nothing to learn from a producer or engineer who had made fewer records 
than we had.  Youthful enthusiasm is all very well, but we needed enthusiasm 
with some <strong>experience</strong>!<p>

Enter -- or <strong>re</strong>-enter -- Peter Collins, the diminutive, 
bearded, cigar-smoking Englishman (and true gentleman) who also worked with 
us as co-producer on <strong>Power Windows</strong> and <strong>Hold Your 
Fire</strong>.  Once again, Peter was the ideal "objective ear" for us,
another counterpart.  Dedicated to the <strong>song</strong> above everything, he 
weighs a performance or a part only in regard to the <strong>feeling</strong> 
it conveys, its contribution
to the whole edifice (like an architect, he has an "edifice complex").  Peter
holds himself aloof from the technique and technology, the craftwork -- 
"quality control," as he terms it -- and rightly considers these things to 
be the domain of the musicians and the engineer.  The rest of us can huddle 
around the mixing
console and fuss over the fine details of musicianship and sound, while his job
is to keep the project <strong>moving</strong>, and to ensure that 
<strong>craft</strong> is not allowed to
interfere with <strong>art</strong> -- the song.  That's his 
secret, if he has one.<p>

We did discover some new engineers, and Kevin "Caveman" Shirley was our choice
for the actual recording.  His previous work seemed to capture the instrumenents
in a raw, direct fashion, powerful and exciting and as faithful as possible to
what drums and guitars <strong>really</strong> sound like.  Our Caveman 
was somewhat of a purist,
using few effects and a minimum of processing.  For example, if I asked him to
alter the sound of my hi-hat, say for more brightness or more body, instead of 
simply twidling a knob on the desk he would come out and move the microphone.
As the Caveman's counterpart, we brought in Michael Letho for the final mixing.
Michael's previous work displayed a refined, architectural style of layering
and building a song (another "edifice complex"), and we hoped this would 
complement the Caveman's style, and our own, combining rawness and refinement-
spit and polish, you might say-gaining both and sacrificing neither.  As Peter
Collins remarked at the end:  "Isn't it nice when a plan actually 
<strong>works</strong>!"<p>

The Concise Oxford defines "counterpart" both as "duplicate" and as "opposite,"
in the sense of "forming a natural complement to another."  That's what I
thought was so interesting about the word:  considered in this way, contraries
are <strong>reflections</strong> of each other, opposite numbers, and not 
necessarily 
contradictions, enemies, The Other.  Polarities are not to be resisted, but 
reconciled.  Reaching for the alien shore.<p>

Dualities like gender or race are not opposite but true <strong>counterparts
</strong>, the same
and yet different, and not to be seen as some existential competition -- we 
could do without that.  Better yet:  we could <strong>get along</strong> 
without that.<p>

In this light, a listener should not mistake the irony of "Stick It Out," with 
its plea for both fortitude <strong>and</strong> forbearance.  Or "Animate," which is not about
<strong>two</strong> individuals, but about one man addressing his 
<strong>anima</strong> -- his feminine side, 
as defined by Carl Jung.  Within that duality, what " a man must learn to
gently dominate" is <strong>himself</strong>, his own "submissive trait," 
while also learning to "gently dominate" 
the <strong>animus</strong> -- the male thing -- and the other hormone 
driven "A-words" like 
aggression and ambition.  We dominate by not submitting, whether to brute 
instinct, violent rage, or ruthless greed.<p>

For the rest of it, we can all dominate or submit as the occasion warrants, try 
to reconcile the duplicates and opposites, and dream of racing through life at
the speed of love (186,000 miles per second, if you believe in love at first
sight).  Everyone wants the ideal of "forming a natural complement to another."
A counterpart.  Friendship, love, and partners in life and work are the rewards
for bridging that gap between 'duplicate' and 'opposite.'<p>

Counterparts.  Words and music.  Guitar, bass, drums.  Writing, rehearsing,
and recording.  Flying and driving and working and laughing.  Alex's flashes of 
dazzling spontaneity, twisted humor, and emotional fire, Geddy's melodic
instinct, wry wit, and meticulous passion, my own obsessive drive and rhythmic
bombast.  True synergy, I guess:  the whole greater that the parts -- which are,
after all, just humble old <strong>us</strong>.<p>

The course of true synergy may not always run smooth, like any "real world"
relationship, but even occasional friction, if handled with respect and
dignity, can be a grindstone and create its own sparks -- no pearl grows without
a grain of irritation at its heart.  (The trick is to grow a pearl and not an
<strong>ulcer</strong>.)  And really, who wants to be around people who 
<strong>agree</strong> with you all the
time?  Differing opinions are part of the chemistry -- for example, I still get 
excited at seeing how much my lyrics are improved by input from the other 
two -- but together we also have to face the maddening complexity of the 
forces around us:  the mechanics of running a large organization, the hassles 
of business, the erosion of privacy, the absence from home, and sometimes the 
soul-destroying <strong>ennui</strong> of too long a tour. ("The only thing 
worse than touring is <strong>not</strong> touring," that's my motto.)<p>

So we do what must be done, and try to balance it out with the challenges and
satisfactions of our private lives.  Our job is to pour out as much as we can
into  the melting pot of Rush, tributaries flowing to the larger river, sparks
added to the fire, reflections carried to the mirror.  That's how we can best 
pursue happiness.<p>

And that <strong>is</strong> the secret, when all is said and done. "The 
pursuit of happiness"
may be the finest phrase in history, and some people seem to forget that
<strong>happiness</strong> is what we're supposed to be chasing here.  Not 
short-lived
pleasures, not commodities, not good hair or perfect cheekbones, but simply 
enjoying the mountain while we're climbing it.  The upward paths may be hardest,
but they have the best views.<p>

And to our way of thinking, we <strong>can</strong> continue to move 
upward -- we just have to hold
off the rust of laziness, the mold of the marketplace, and the patina of 
cynicism.  Pursuing such a complicated and elusive state is easier said than
done, of course, but while we're chasing it we sometimes learn one thing -- 
that it <strong>is</strong> a chase, and we may as well cut to it.<p>

That's the secret, if there is one.<p>

Just the other day a long time ago, J.J. and I were talking about what we
needed to do to change the look and sound of my equipment rig. We made a list
of all the important items that needed to be considered for such a change.<p>

Here are some of these:<p>

1. Get stuff that has a lot of flashing lights.<br>
2. Get stuff that's bigger than it needs to be.<br>
3. Get stuff that's really expensive.<br>
4. Get a bunch of extra flashing lights.<br>
5. Make sure you have a total of at least 50 knobs you can turn.<br>
6. Get a tractor to haul all the stuff you've got but don't really need.<p>

(It was this last item that caused all the trouble...)<p>

We followed our list closely. We were quite proud of ourselves, having managed
to find Marshall amps from the distributor at the highest price allowable and
only had to wait months for delivery. They came with the "Tons o'Knobs"
option, a relatively unknown and unused extra. We could only get three lights
per stack, so we ordered four for twelve at twelve hundred per one at a quarter
after ten on the nineteenth. The equation looks something like this: 3lexE
4120 sine = 12T +lt @ 19 = $$$.<p>

Now, we knew that the Law of Excessive Amplification calls for an even number
of amps, but decided to go with three. We set it all up and realized that we'd
made a mistake and immediately ordered another stack -- for now. We took some
time and worked the system out in a field far from human ears, and I have to
say, I got really excited with the results. In fact, I was so up that I had
one too many glasses of wine -- a fine Burgundy from Leroy that was rich and
cherry-like without an overbearing fruit, yet delicate and not smelly. Anyway,
I demanded to drive the amps around with the tractor, and even though J.J.
protested, I had my way. Before I realized it, I'd lost the amps in the tall
Fescue while I was pulling donuts, and felt a funny bump under the tractor's
rotating blades as I sped out of control, laughing hysterically.<p>

We just call him J. now. We did manage to find a staple gun, and after
administering a whole bottle of wine (a pleasant Rioja from the '85 vintage
that displayed a robust body without the sharpness of the broken shards of
glass), we managed to do a decent job of reattachment. At least he had a leg
to stand on.<p>

And I got a kick out of that.<p>

Tuesday December 14, 1993. KWIPTMENT LIST '93...<p>

It is time once again to fill this space, ambiguously referred to as the
Equipment List. Here we are in the midst of rehearsals, preparing for the
"coming tour." What does this preparation mean, you ask?<p>

Well, it means reacquainting ourselves with crew members, longstanding and
new ones, coffee and donuts (sinkers), blisters, headaches, and other
assorted anxiety-related pleasantries.<p>

And (thank goodness) it also brings the increasingly-more-necessary jokes
about amps, speakers, ear molds (I said ear <strong>molds</strong>, not ear
<strong>moulds</strong>!!), keyboards, weight problems, the aging process,
g-g-g-golf, baseball, and of course, donuts! (I wonder who invented donuts? I
dunno, probably, probably some genius.)<p>

Altogether, it's an action-packed, fun-filled few weeks, vibing together in a
lovely suburban warehouse motif, hidden in a scenic stretch of strip malls in
East Toronto!!<p>

It is, indeed, a glamorous life...<p>

Oh! Before I forget -- for those interested in such things, I actually have
some new Equipment on this tour! Gasp! (Did he win a contest?, you ask.) Yes,
it's true, after 200 years of touring, I have new amps. Just call me
impetuous!<p>

The are as follows: Trace Elliot Quatra 4VR amplifiers, GP12 SMX preamps, with
two single-18" speaker cabs and two 4x10" speaker cabs.<p>

Hey, let's not stop there! I'll also be using Fender Jazz Basses and a bunch
of keyboards!!<p>

That's it for now! See ya!!<p>

This photo was taken in October '92, during a Bicycle Africa tour of Mali,
Senegal, and The Gambia. Djenne is a medieval town in the inland delta of the
Niger River, not far from Timbuktu. The "Great Mosque," like the rest of
Djenne, is built of mud, and every year after the rains they have to climb up
and resurface that mud, using the exposed beams as scaffolding. The minarets
are topped with ostrich eggs, and altogether it's about as amazing a thing as
this reporter has ever seen. My friend Mendelson Joe says this photo looks
like "a retired hockey player visiting another planet." And that's about how I
felt -- except for the "retired hockey player" part.<p>

So anyway... what's new in Drumland? Well, not a lot really. After the big
changes I made to the kit for Roll The Bones, this time I just got a new color
(Black Cherry, another one of the "hot rod" paint jobs.) The kit was
co-ordinated, assembled, and "vibrafibed" (a thin layer of fiberglass on the
inner shell) by Neal Graham, Larry Allen, and XL Specialty in Fort Wayne. The
drums are still Ludwigs, and the cymbals are Zildjians (except for the two
Chinese Wuhans).<p>

Electronically. the aging Akai samplers are driven by d-drum pads, a KAT
midi-marimba, Shark pedals, and Sid the amazing mini-trigger, while a Dauz pad
also triggers occasional keyboard "events."<p>

Otherwise, I still use that old Slingerland snare, a Remo "Legato" marching
snare, a 13" Ludwig piccolo on the back kit, Tama gong bass drum, Promark
sticks, Remo heads, LP cowbells, some wind chimes, and -- probably our
most-asked-about piece of hardware -- two little squirrel-cage fans to help
keep my hands dry.<p>

And those, despite any claims to the contrary, are my biggest fans...<p>
