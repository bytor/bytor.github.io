<dd>The first album featured drummer John Rutsey, who played only on this
album.  Neil Peart replaced Rutsey before the start of their first American
tour.</dd><p>

<dd><strong>Alex Lifeson (from "Success Under Pressure"): </strong>"That's how 
the first Lp was done. I think we only spent three days of
actual recording, and then a couple more re-doing two songs and mixing the
whole thing. It was all done in under a week, but was spread out over
several months."</dd>

Need Some Love
---- ---- ----

I'm runnin' here,

I'm lookin' for a girl.
'Cause there's nothin' I need,

in the whole wide world.

Well, I need it quick
and I need it now,
before I start to fade away.
That's why I'm searchin',

Oo yes, I need some love
This feelin' I can't rise above.
Yeah, yeah!

Well I been hustlin' here,

I been searchin' for about a week.
And I started feelin'
this strange sensation.
My knees are startin' gettin' weak.

Well I need what keeps
a young man alive;
I'm sayin' I need it now.
I'm gonna get the message
across to you
someway, somehow.

Oo, I need some love.

Take A Friend
---- - ------
Well, I'm lookin' at you,
and I'm wond'rin' what you're gonna do.
Looks like you got no friends,
no one to stick with you till the end.

Take yourself a friend.
Kep 'em till the end.
Whether woman or man,
it makes you feel so good,
so good.

Yes, you think you're all right,
and now you're lonely ev'ry night.
Well, you need a friend,
someone on whom you can always depend.

Take yourself a friend.
Kep 'em till the end.
Whether woman or man,

Yes, you need some advice.
Well, let me put it to you nice.
I said you need a friend,
someone who'll stick with you to the end.

Take yourself a friend.
Kep 'em till the end.

Here Again
---- -----
I said I played this song
so many times before
that the melody keeps repeating
growing new ideas,
flowing chords and notes
like a mountain river bleeding.

Well, I say as I look back,
And all the thoughts I've had,
They reflect just what I'm learning.
Yes, you know that the hardest part,
Yes, I say it is to stay on top,
On top of a world forever churning.

Well, you say you can laugh,
But I can see that your eyes are glass.
Well, do you see, can't you see, what I'm feeling?
Yes, I've seen your face before.
Why, I've seen it everywhere,
Showing up to me without a scent revealing.

Well, I said will it ever change?
Will it stay the same?
I'd surely like to know before it's over.
Well, I said I played some.
I said it won't be long,
Won't be long before I stop and play it over.

Oh, oh I've, I've seen your face before.
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?
Oh, oh I've, I've been in one place too long.
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?

What You're Doing
---- ------ -----
Well, I see you standin' there
with your finger in the air.
Ev'rything we do,
you wanna leave it up to you.

Who do you think you are?
You think you are a star,
try'n' to run the town,
always try'n' to put us down.

Well, you think that you're right.
You think you're out of sight.
Tell me something, mister;
why'd you have to make us so uptight?

Well, you say you've been try'n'.
You know that you're ly'n'.
I think you need some groovin'.
Who do you think you're foolin' now?

Well, you better start changin'.
You life needs rearrangin'.
You better do some talkin'
or you better do some walkin' now.

Yeah, you think that you're right.
You think you're out of sight.
Tell me something, mister;
why'd you have to make us so uptight?

I know what you're doing,

oh, but you been feelin' long.

Well, you think that you're right.
Tell me something, mister;
why'd you have to make us so uptight?

Well, you're makin' me crazy,

Won't you come and sit with me.
I'll tell you all my lies.

Hey baby, it's a quarter to eight.

Hey baby, the hour is late.
I feel I've got to move.

Well, hey now, baby,
Don't you talk so fast.

And now you're fina'lly list'nin'

Well, I don't want to be your lover.
Babe, I wanna be your man.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Well, now my story's over, baby,

Working Man
------- ---
I get up at seven, yeah,
and I go to work at nine.
I got no time for livin'.
Yes, I'm workin' all the time.

It seems to me
I could live my life
a lot better than I think I am.
I guess that's why they call me,
they call me the workin' man.

They call me the workin' man.
I guess that's what I am.

I get home at five o'clock,
and I take myself out a nice, cold beer.
Always seem to be wond'rin'
why there's nothin' goin' down here.

It seems to me
