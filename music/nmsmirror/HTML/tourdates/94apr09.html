<font size=+2>The Quad-City Times (Moline, IL)<br>
April 11, 1994</font><p>

<font size=+1>Rush rocks The Mark</font><br>
<b>by Holly A. Smith</b><p>

     Rush couldn't make it Saturday night to The Mark of the Quad-Cities.<p>
     Instead, the Canadian rockers sent Charlton Heston to play drums, Fabio
to play guitar and Barbara Streisand to perform lead vocals.<p>
     At least that's what guitarist Alex Lifeson told the crowd.<p>
     The trio played a mix of old and new music for about 90 minutes without
a break.  It was obvious that they were promoting their new disc,
"Counterparts," playing at least five cuts from it.<p>
     Their performance was accompanied by pyrotechnics, a movie theater-size
screen behind the band and lots of the obligatory rock 'n' roll smoke and
lights.<p>
     However, the smoke was not thick enough to choke anyone in the front
few rows.<p>
     After teasing the crowd for 45 minutes with songs such as "Cold Fire"
"Spirit of Radio," "Nobody's Hero" and "Roll the Bones," Lifeson jested
that the concert was over.  It was not a popular comment.<p>
     Most of the songs were accompanied by video on the movie screen, which
was a nice diversion because the band members were fairly unanimated except
for Lifeson, who strolled back and forth across the stage, playing to
audience members in the front row.<p>
     One of the best performances of the night was "Closer to the Heart,"
which brought out the lighters in the audience and lead singer Geddy Lee
to front and center of the stage.<p>
     Other highlights included "Stick It Out" from the new disc, a 
head-banging anthem that ended with small fireworks showering the stage and a
loud boom.<p>
     "You guys OK out there?"  Lee asked the crowd.<p>
     Primus opened the show at 8 p.m. sharp and played for 40 minutes.  I
knew precious little about the group before the concert, but it was a good
show.  The trio performed four songs, including "My Name Is Mud."  The only
reason I can tell you that is I read about the song in an article
beforehand.  The lyrics to their songs were incomprehensible.  I couldn't
understand what they were singing, but it sounded good.<p>
     There was only a 20-minute lull between Primus and the headliners.<p>
     While the show was an awesome display of musicianship and lights,
The Mark has some kinks to work out.<p>
     Concert goers were patted down before being let inside the arena,
which is nothing unusual.  But The Mark's security manager must not be a
woman.  Male ticket holders moved much faster through the secruity check
than the large numbers of female ticket holders who were filtered through
one guard at the entrance I used.<p>
     The guys got two guards at that entrance while the women were packed
in a group, much like waiting in the restroom.<p>
     By 10 p.m., I was perspiring and in desperate need of a soda pop.
Unfortunately, the concession stand closest to my seat already had closed.<p>
