<font size=+1>Rush leader keeps in touch with the people</font><br>
<b>By Michael Eck</b><p>

You may want to keep your eye out for Neil Peart riding his bicycle around
downtown Albany Saturday afternoon.<p>

That is, if you know what he looks like. <p>

Peart, the drummer for Rush, who will appear with special guests Mr. Big at
the Knickerbocker Arena on Saturday, makes a point of what he calls
"protecting anonymity."<p>

As lyricist for the long-running Canadian power trio, Peart feels it 
important to keep in touch with people and their everyday lives. Biking 
around cities he performs in is one way of doing that.<p>

In their earlier days, the trio's lyrics tended towards flights of fantasy. Any
message could be laced through a land of necromancers, snow dogs and space
wizards.<p>

In the '80s, Peart's words took a decided turn towards more tangible concepts.
Intellectuals would still snigger, but his is the stuff that inspires suburban
dreams of something better, for the kids of all ages who listen in.<p>

"The backstage life," he says, "is an alienating bubble of non-reality... you
have to make the effort... you have to go out and watch people and keep in
touch."<p>

Musically, Rush's material, created by Peart, bassist/vocalist Geddy Lee and
guitarist Alex Lifeson, has always been marked by change.<p>

Over the course of 13 studio albums in 15 years, Rush has moved from simply
being a Led Zeppelin clone to one of the most technologically-advanced
music-making machines in rock.<p>

Fans of that spirit of adventure have followed them.<p>

"At our concerts, now you see kids who weren't even born when we started
playing. You see others who have grown up with us and had to get a babysitter
for the night so they could come out and see a Rush show."<p>

Peart feels the group's latest effort, "Presto," recorded after a rare year-long
break, is as different as it could possibly be from their earlier work, like the
mystical pop of "Fly by Night"or the space opera "2112." Or even from
mid-'80s efforts like "Moving Pictures," their biggest-selling album.<p>

"It's changed in every conceivable way," he says. "Those are like your fridge
paintings when you were a child - only your mom doesn't keep dragging those
out for everyone to see and compare your present work to.<p>

"We're not the kind of band that just trots out the oldies," Peart remarks, 
while complaining about recent Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney tours.<p>

"We've gone down a lot of different roads since then. The aim of constant
change and experimentation is the same, but that's it."<p>

Mr. Big is a modern supergroup spearheaded by Buffalo bass wunderkind Billy
Sheehan.<p>

This hard rock quartet also features former Racer X guitarist Paul Gilbert,
ex-Robert Plant drummer Pat Torpey, and one-time solo vocalist Eric Martin.<p>

Sheehan led the Buffalo-based hard rock trio Talas for a decade before finding
fame as part of David Lee Roth's Eat 'Em and Smile band along with guitarist
Steve Vai and drumer Gregg Bissonette. <p>

<font size=+1>Visuals spectacular for magical Rush</font><p>

<b>by Dina Williams</b><p>

It was Theater of the Large -- and like the tiny Lilliputians, a worshipful Rush
audience found a Gulliver Saturday night at the Knickerbocker Arena, one that
was gargantuan compared to everyday life.<p>

Rush, known for its experimentation and technical innovations, particularly
drummer Neil Peart's percussion, fulfilled expectations with hits spanning the
band's 15-year career as well as several from their recent album "Presto." <p>

The evening's theme was magic, and for the devotees who packed the Knick to
its rafters, Merlin couldn't have done better than the Canadian trio.<p>

A pair of giant, dancing rabbits popped out of enormous top hats. A laser show
danced over the stage and into the arena's far corners. "The Midget Magicians"
transformed from a drawing to an animated cartoon into elaborate film footage.<p>

The visuals were spectacular, but the focus of the evening was on the band's
lyrically and instrumentally finely-crafted songs.<p>

Peart's drumming was in fine form, especially during his solo on "YYZ." Alex
Lifeson kept up the pace with precise guitar gymnastics and bassist Geddy Lee
agrressively stretched the range of his instrument. His distinctive, 
high-pitched vocals topped with "On the Past," a song about teen suicide from 
"Presto."<p>

Peart's literary lyrics often probe how society smothers young people's
individuality and potential, but with optimism -- hope for their ability to
overcome obstacles and change the world.<p>

This grandiose theme and numerous lengthy instrumentals eventually wore thin.
Rush hit its stride, though, with several songs from "Presto" before their
encores.<p>

"Show Me, Don't Tell Me" was a highlight, ironically expressing a desire for
communication without hocus-pocus.<p>

Mr. Big played a mighty metal set to open that was heavy on the Spandex,
meaty guitar solos and power vocals.<p>

The line-up consists of formerly Buffalo-based Talas and David Lee Roth
bassist Billy Sheehan (who could have used more volume); ex-Racer X guitarist
Paul Gilbert; one-time Robert Plant drummer Pat Torpey and former solo
vocalist Eric Martin
