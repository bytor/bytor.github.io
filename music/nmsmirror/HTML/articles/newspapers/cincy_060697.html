<font size=+1>Rush puts on merely standard act</font><br>
<b>by Chris Varias</b><p>

Only the most devoted Rush fans know what Geddy Lee is singing about, and the
rest don't care.<p>

For every listener turned off by the Canadian trio's use of mythological
themes, there is another sold on the band's blend of art rock and hard 
rock.<p>

Behind all of Rush's literary and musical heavy-handedness stands Mr. Lee, the
bassist and vocalist who doesn't take himself or his band too seriously.  The
opening fanfare to the band's Riverbend performance Wednesday night proved
that.<p>

Pavement's recent single "Stereo" blasted fvrom the PA system and segued into
Rush's charge to the stage.  The song makes reference to Mr. Lee's melodious
cackle: "What about the voice of Geddy Lee / How did it get so high /
I wonder does he speak like an ordinary guy."<p>

"We've got 4 or 5 million songs to play for you tonight," announced Mr. Lee
early in the three-hour show.  "I hope you've taken your medication."<p>

"Limelight", "Spirit of Radio" and "Tom Sawyer" were just a few of the radio
favorites the band mixed with newer songs.<p>

During another, "The Trees", Mr. Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson stalked one
another and traded heavy-metal grimaces, all the while with tongues in 
cheeks.<p>

The most striking things about their newer and less-popular material were the
accompanying videos projected on a large screen behind the band.<p>

The rapid-fire images set to "Nobody's Hero" were especially eyebrow raising.
Flashing an image of Steubenville, Ohio's favorite son, Dean Martin, during a
song called "Nobody's Here" could be considered as a riotous act by some
Buckeyes.<p>

Years of arena-hopping are slowly catching up with Neil Peart, hero to
drummers who prefer flash over subtlety.  With his expanding midsection and
Van Dyke beard, he's beginning to take on the look of one of his drumming
contemporaries, Cheap Trick's Bun E. Carlos.<p>

Mr. Peart plays to and for the crowd.  He tossed a drumstick straight up in
the air several times throughout the night and cleanly caught it at about an
80 percent clip.  His kit was set upon a rotating platform, so he could spin i
around, use each of his numerous drums and never turn his back to his
devotees.<p>

Many onlookers among the crowd of 11,206 yelped in reaction to a gratuitous
drum solo.  Most of those yelps were not a stamp of approval for extraordinary
playing, but simply programmed responses to recognizing a drum solo.<p>
