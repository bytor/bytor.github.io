<font size=+3>Between Right and Wrong</font><br>
by Dale R. Buske<br>
<em>December 16, 1993</em>
<p>

There is a man between Foley and Dole<br>
That not too many are thrilled about<br>
Forty-three percent, not a rout<br>
The man between wishes and doubt<p>

He was a fine man, now he's going to waste<br>
Those on the left, they all make him lie<br>
The choice between burgers and fries<p>

Ahh-ahh no to yes to ahh-ahh no to yes<br>
Why this debt?<br>
A cat a pet?<p>

Ahh-ahh no to yes to ahh-ahh no to yes<br>
Time to flip<br>
Time to flop<p>

There is a fine line between votes and collusion<br>
On CNN Al will debate<br>
The gap between tasteless and tact<br>
The spin around wishes and fact<p>

This is quite the man to hesitate<br>
Those Lani Guiniers, not politically shy<br>
The talk about taxes and lies<p>

Ahh-ahh no to yes to ahh-ahh no to yes<br>
Why this choice?<br>
Elect him twice?<p>

Ahh-ahh no to yes to ahh-ahh no to yes<br>
Time to flip<br>
Time to flop<p>

We can all hope that crime will go down soon<br>
Hope that recession will turn to boom<br>
No world war crisis lets him save some face<br>
He need a break from this rhetorical place<p>

This is a fine man, now he's going to waste<br>
Those on the left, they all make him lie<br>
The voters shake their heads and wonder why<p>

Ahh-ahh no to yes to ahh-ahh no to yes<br>
Why this man?<br>
Why this plan?<p>

Ahh-ahh no to yes to ahh-ahh no to yes<br>
Why not Bush?<br>
Why not Rush?<p>
