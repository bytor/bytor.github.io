<font size=+1><strong>On the cover of Permanent Waves</font></strong><br><br>
<strong>
<dd>The cover photo of Permanent Waves is visually arresting and is one that 
Neil supervised.</strong>  <P> 

<strong>Neil Peart (1983 interview): </strong>
"That cover was a real headache for me, because Geddy was off producing 
Lionel's at the time, and I think maybe Alex was away or something, and I was 
the only one that was around.  And I kept getting these phone calls about, 
well, you can't do this and you can't do that, and there was, in fact, in the 
back of the hurricane scene there was a little Coca-cola sign, and the 
Coca-cola people wouldn't let it go on there, because it was too close to the 
semi-naked thighs of this girl, you know, this....  They didn't want the 
connotations of sexuality."<p>

<strong>The artist Hugh Syme on the cover he designed</strong><p>

<strong>Hugh Syme (<a href="../HTML/articles/creem83.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/creem83.html">Creem, 1983</a>): </strong>
"Permanent Waves is the result of a conversation which I had with Neil out
at his home in the country.  We spoke all evening about Rush growing up, and
how we were going to do these EKG readings of each member as they were
recording.  We were going to tape their temples and chests and have real
heartbeats of them while they were playing.  So Permanent Waves was going to
be a technical statement, and we were going to treat that with red and gold
foil, and do a nice study in design- as opposed to a photographic thing. <P>

"I walked out and, in the doorway, said 'Wait! Let's try something with Donna
Reed, with her permanent Toni hairdo, and have her walking out of a tidal wave
situation.' <P>

"Neil gave me this blank look and said, 'Get out of here.' <P>

"The following day, he asked me to consider doing just that because he'd
discussed it with the band, and they'd all thought it was more likely for a
cover than the serious approach.  <P>

"We shot the newspaper with the headline "Dewey Defeats Truman," which now
looks like "(Arabic)-Daily-(Arabic)," because we got a threat from the legal
people at the Chicago Tribune, who are still embarrassed about their
over-anxious printing of that headline.  <P>

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> 
I noticed that the "Y"in "Dewey" has been changed to an "I" in the headline. <P>

"That's because anything that pertains to that headline, according to the
Chicago Tribune, is an embarrassment, and is subject to litigation if we were
to print up any facet of it.  <P>

"To boot, Coca-Cola asked that we strip out their billboard way off in the
background because it was too close to a cotton-clad mons pubis."
<p>

<strong>What does the woman represent?</strong><p>

<strong>Neil Peart (<a href="../HTML/articles/snds0480.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/snds0480.html">Sounds, April 
1980</a>): </strong>
"The woman on the cover is really a symbol of us. If you think
that's sexist in a negative way -- well, it's really looking at
ourselves so I don't think it can be. The idea is her perfect
imperturbability in the face of all this chaos. In that she
represents us.<p>

"In the basic sense, all that cover picture means is forging on
regardless, being completely uninvolved with all the chaos and
ridiculous nonsense that's going on around us. Plus she represents
the spirit of music and the spirit of radio, a symbol of perfect
integrity and truth and beauty and..."

"This is where a sense of humor comes into it. I was sitting there thinking 
of the conclusion of the song and the parody came into my mind. And I thought, 
'Well, either this is very stupid or it's very great.' <P>

"But all it says is...salesman as artists I can see as an ideal, but they 
have no place telling us what to play onstage and they have no place in the 
recording studio telling us how to write songs...any more than a car 
salesman.'"</dd></dl>

The Spirit of Radio
--- ------ -- -----
Begin the day with a friendly voice,
A companion unobtrusive
Plays the song that's so elusive
And the magic music makes your morning mood.

Off on your way, hit the open road,
There is magic at your fingers
For the Spirit ever lingers,
Undemanding contact in your happy solitude.

Invisible airwaves crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle with the energy
Emotional feedback on timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price, almost free

All this machinery making modern music
Can still be open-hearted.
Not so coldly charted, it's really just a question
Of your honesty, yeah, your honesty.

One likes to believe in the freedom of music,
But glittering prizes and endless compromises
Shatter the illusion of integrity.

For the words of the profits were written on the studio wall,
Concert hall
And echoes with the sounds of salesmen.

<font size=+1><strong>What is "Freewill" about?</font></strong><br><br>

<dd><strong>Geddy Lee ("Rockline", Dec 4 1989): </strong>
"The song is about freedom of choice and free will, and you
believing in what you decide you believe in." </dd>
</dl><p>
<dl>
<font size=+1><strong>In "Freewill" which lyrics are correct (the ones 
on the album sleeve or the ones Geddy sings)?</font></strong><br><br>

<dd><strong>Neil Peart (Rush Backstage Club newsletter, December 1985):
</strong>"That's a funny question.  I've had a few lately from people who 
are so sure that what they hear is correct, that they disbelieve what I've put
in the lyric sheets!  Imagine!  People have quoted me whole verses of
what they hear, as opposed to what's printed, sure that they are right
and the cover (me) is wrong.  Scary stuff, these egocentric individuals.
I assure you, other than perhaps dropping an "and" or a "but," we take
great care to make the lyric sheets accurate." </dd>
</dl><p>
<dl>

<font size=+1><strong>Where is "Lotus-Land?"</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Neil Peart: </strong>"Lotus-land as it appears in 'Free Will' is 
simply a metaphor for an
idealized background, a 'land of milk and honey.'  It is sometimes
also used as a pejorative name for Los Angeles, though that was not
in my mind when I wrote it." <p>

<strong>From the Rush FAQ: </strong>
Lotus-land is mentioned in an episode in "The Odyssey" where Odysseus
goes to the land of the lotus-eaters, where the people hang out
and eat lotus petals or some such and are perfectly happy but
are basically brainless.</dd></dl>

Freewill
--------
There are those who think that life has nothing left to chance,
A host of holy horrors to direct our aimless dance.

A planet of playthings,
We dance on the strings
Of powers we cannot perceive
"The stars aren't aligned -
Or the gods are malign"
Blame is better to give than receive.

You can choose a ready guide in some celestial voice.
If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.
You can choose from phantom fears and kindness that can kill;
I will choose a path that's clear-
I will choose Free Will.

There are those who think that they were dealt a losing hand,
The cards were stacked against them- they weren't born in Lotus-Land.

All preordained-
A prisoner in chains-
A victim of venomous fate.
Kicked in the face,
You can't pray for a place
In heaven's unearthly estate.

Each of us-
A cell of awareness-
Imperfect and incomplete.
Genetic blends
With uncertain ends
On a fortune hunt that's far too fleet.

<font size=+1><strong>What is the song about?</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Neil Peart (Rush Backstage Club newsletter, December 1985): 
</strong>
This song simply describes the phenomenon of the sun breaking through the
clouds in visible rays, as it sometimes does after a rain or on a cloudy day.
The actual name seems to be one of those traditional names for natural things
which has probably been around for ages.  I think Geddy actually suggested the
idea to me, after hearing his mother-in-law use the name.  It had a nice sound
to it, and of course the event itself is a beautiful and inspiring one.</dd>

<strong>Neil Peart (<a href="../HTML/articles/snds0480.html" tppabs="http://syrinx.yyz.com/HTML/articles/snds0480.html">Sounds, April 
1980</a>): </strong>
"Whereas most of the ideas we were dealing with this time were on the lesser
side, and in some cases, like in 'Jacobs Ladder', looked at as
a cinematic idea, where we created all the music first to
summon up an image -- the <strong>effect</strong> of Jacobs Ladder -- and
paint the picture, with the lyrics added, just as a sort of
little detail, later, to make it more descriptive."

Jacob's Ladder
------- ------
The clouds prepare for battle
In the dark and brooding silence.
Bruised and sullen stormclouds
Have the light of day obscured.
Looming low and ominous
In twilight premature
Thunderheads are rumbling
In a distant overture...

All at once, the clouds are parted.
Light streams down in bright unbroken beams...

Follow men's eyes as they look to the skies.
The shifting shafts of shining weave the fabric of their dreams...

Entre Nous
----- ----
We are secrets to each other
Each one's life a novel
No-one else has read.
Even joined in bonds of love,
We're linked to one another
By such slender threads.

We are planets to each other,
Drifting in our orbits
To a brief eclipse.
Each of us a world apart,
Alone and yet together,
Like two passing ships.

Just between us,
I think it's time for us to recognize
The differences we sometimes fear to show.
Just between us,
I think it's time for us to realize,
The spaces in between
Leave room for you and I to grow.

We are strangers to each other,
Full of sliding panels,
An illusion show.
Acting well-rehearsed routines
Or playing from the heart?
It's hard for one to know.

We are islands to each other,
Building hopeful bridges
On a troubled sea.
Some are burned or swept away,
Some we would not choose,
But we're not always free.

Different Strings
--------- -------
Who's come to slay the dragon,
Come to watch him fall?
Making arrows out of pointed words,
Giant killers at the call?
Too much fuss and bother,
Too much contradiction and confusion.
Peel away the mystery,
Here's a clue to some real motivation.

All there really is,
The two of us,
And we both know why we've come along.
Nothing to explain,
It's a part of us
To be found within a song.

What happened to our innocence,
Did it go out of style?
Along with our naivete',
No longer a child.
Different eyes see different things,
Different hearts beat on different strings.
But there are times
For you and me, when all such things agree.

Natural Science
------- -------
 1. Tide Pools
When the ebbing tide retreats
Along the rocky shoreline,
It leaves a trail of tidal pools
In a short-lived galaxy.
Each microcosmic planet
A complete society.

A simple kind mirror
To reflect upon our own.
All the busy little creatures
Chasing out their destinies.
Living in their pools,
They soon forget about the sea...

Wheels within wheels in a spiral array,
A pattern so grand and complex,
Time after time we lose sight of the way,
Our causes can't see their effects.

 2. Hyerspace
A quantum leap forward
In time and in space,
The universe learned to expand.

The mess and the magic,
Triumphant and tragic,
A mechanized world out of hand.

Computerized clinic
For superior cynics
Who dance to a synthetic band.

In their own image,
Their world is fashioned.
No wonder they don't understand.

 3. Permanent Waves
Science, like nature
Must also be tamed
With a view towards its preservation.
Given the same
State of integrity,
It will surely serve us well.

Art as expression,
Not as market campaigns
Will still capture our imaginations.
Given the same
State of integrity,
It will surely help us along.

The most endangered species,
The honest man,
Will still survive annihilation.
Forming a world
State of integrity,
Sensitive, open and strong.

Wave after wave will flow with the tide, and bury the world as it does.
Tide after tide will flow and recede, leaving life to go on as it was...
