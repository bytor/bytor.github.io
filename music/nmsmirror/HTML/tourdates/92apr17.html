<h3>The thinking man's headbangers</h3>

<p>
Thoughtlessly derieded for their unfashionably "progressive" music and
routinely revlied for their libertarian politics, Rush have nevertheless
sustained an enviable lever of international success throughout the
Eighties. And it turns out that the group has had a far greater influence
on modern rock than anyone predicted, with a new generation of
heavyweights, from Metallica to Living Colour, now admitting a debt to the
Canadian trio's pioneering work in developing a heavy rock aesthetic that
is both intelligent and suitably gung ho.
<p>
For Rush, however, the hard thinking has long since overtaken the hard
rocking, and in terms of raw, speedy excitement, the group can no longer
hold a candle to its proteges. Indeed, the first of two Wembley shows was
such a tightly-scripted affair that any passion or personality which the
band might have possessed was squeezed out like juice from a lemon, leaving
a dry husk with a distinctive tang.
<p>
The show's appeal rested on flawless production values and a display of
monumentally efficient musicianship. The tone was established early on by
"Time Stand Still" a firm, but sophisticated rocker, fleshed out by
guitarist Alex Lifeson's precise arpeggios and supplemented visually by a
beautifully-filmed sequence of back-projected images; a faintly surreal,
aerial sweep above rivers, forests and mountain ravines.
<p>
They continued to mine this seam of mellow, manicured metal with a string
of tracks from the current album <strong>Roll the Bones</strong>, a Top Ten 
hit both here and in America. Attention was engaged (even if the emotions were 
not) by the clean-cut melody of "Dreamline", the harsh mechanoid drum track of
"Bravado", and the though-provoking lyric and accompanying visuals of "Roll
the Bones" itself, a sort of poetic dissertation on the relationship
between effort and happenstance in the shaping of an individual's destiny.
<p>
Although bassist Geddy Lee has modified his singing voice so that he no
longer sounds like a man who has just sat down on a red hot poker, its
high, brittle tone remains an acquired taste. His uncanny ability
simultaneously to play complex bass lines and sing radically dissociated
melodies was, however, never less than impressive. So too was Neil Peart's
drum solo, "The Rhythm Method", an explosively concise exposition which
made imaginative use of electronically tuned percussive effects.
<p>
Lifeson and Lee both doubled up on synthesizers and the mix was further
bolstered by backing tapes. With a four-way speaker system and lasers
lancing above the crowd, comparisons with English perennials such as Pink
Floyd, Yes and Genesis were hard to avoid. Like them, Rush is clearly not
an act which is about to disappear in a hurry.
