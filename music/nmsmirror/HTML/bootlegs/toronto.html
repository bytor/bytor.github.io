This cd boot is the exact same as Enemies Within and Beyond but unlike it,
it actually contains some pictures of Rush in the booklet, and doesn't suffer
from the "static" the other does. It is merely a copy of the GUP video
soundtrack, with some songs cut out, and two extra songs from the ESL video
soundtrack ("Freewill" & "Limelight") added in. It is also the same as Life
Under Pressure, although it contains "Limelight" which the Life boot does 
not.<p>

The sound quality, coming directly from a video soundtrack, is of course
excellent. The crowd can seem overpowering at times though, especially if
listening to the disc on headphones. Everything is sharp and clear, and I love
the ominous feeling "Witch Hunt" gives out!<p>

Packing is mediocre at best, it does have pictures of Rush (an amusing one of
Geddy on the front) from the tour in question. It also, however, has a
conviently-placed catalog of their other products inside the booklet.
The date of 1986 is obviously very incorrect.<p>

Between this and the two others listed above, this one rates as the best of
the three. However, this is one to pass by -- if you're looking for a "true"
soundtrack for GUP, and not one chopped up as these three are, try Currently
In Vogue.<p>
