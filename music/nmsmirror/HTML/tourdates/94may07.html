<font size=+1>Nose to the grindstone</font><br>
Rush dispensed with frills and gave a practical, nuts and bolts performance
Saturday night at Maple Leaf Gardens to a full house.<br>
<b>by Alan Niester</b><p>

It was entirely apropos that the stage setup for Rush's appearance at Maple
Leaf Gardens Saturday night was decorated in a nuts and bolts motif. After
all, such hardware decorates the cover of the band's latest Counterparts
album. But even more importantly, the performance the hometown heroes put on
for a full house here was just that -- nuts and bolts, nose to the grindstone,
practical as all get out, with nary an extraneous frill to be heard.<p>

Once the large, animated graphic of a bolt floating through space (to the
strains of "Thus Spake Zarathustra", no less) had been dispensed with, the
trio kicked immediately into a stripped down version of "Dreamline," the
opening cut from the Roll The Bones album.<p>

Although Rush has never really been considered a classic power trio
(traditionally the band has been linked more with the progressive movement)
Saturday's performance centred on the interplay between Alex Lifeson's guitar
lines, Geddy Lee's bass playing and Neil Peart's drums. While a keyboard was
indeed set up stage left, Lee only approached it a few times all evening. And
Lifeson was much more likely to wander out to the front of the stage to play
riffy electric lead guitar lines than he was to add intricate acoustic
passages on a fixed and standing acoustic guitar positioned near the corner of
the stage.<p>

Indeed, most numbers that required the extra keyboards were simply left out of
the set list altogether, as Rush concentrated on numbers best suited for the
guitar/bass/drums attack. "Dreamline" led into classic FM radio hits like
"Spirit Of Radio," "Time Stand Still" and "Roll The Bones." Anything more
complex was presumably saved for next year's MLG visit.<p>

All of this, of course, was in keeping with the tendency displayed on last
year's Counterparts album. That release was an obvious "back to the basics"
album, an attempt to bring the veteran band back into line with the
guitar-dominated nineties. Thus, newer numbers performed Saturday, like the
thought-provoking "Animate" ("polarize me, sensitize me, criticize me,
civilize me"), "Stick It Out," "Cold Fire" and "Double Agent" fit perfectly
into this retrograde approach.<p>

Hard rockers, I Mother Earth opened the show, but the young quintet could have
learned a lot by sticking around for the headliners. As Rush has showed over
the years, loud doesn't necessarily mean thundering and bombastic. It is
possible to integrate melody and nuance into a performance while still nudging
100 decibels.<p>
