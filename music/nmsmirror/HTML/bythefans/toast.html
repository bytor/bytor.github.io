<p>

Like a million little toasters<br>
All the toast that we make<br>
All the impolite customers<br>
All the crap we take.<br>
Oh so many different vocations<br>
We could have occupied<br>
Instead of working for peanuts<br>
At this cheezy dive.<p>

Somehow we found each other<br>
By the backroom wall<br>
Somehow we keep on working<br>
Cleaning up the floor with a mop and broom.<p>

<dl>
CHORUS<br>
<dd>
        I don't want to be a manager<br>
        At this nowhere dead end job<br>
        I don't like the new shift boss<br>
        Who is a big fat brain-dead slob<br>
        I don't want to be the Employee of the Month<br>
        And wear this stupid plastic name-tag<br>
        I want to quit this job at Toast on a Lance<br>
        And work where they put food in a bag, but I need cash.<br>
        But, I need cash.<p>
</dd></dl>

Like a million little jellies<br>
Spilled all over the floor<br>
I wanna quit this stupid job<br>
And walk out that door.<br>
But my guidance councellor told me<br>
I had no skills at all.<br>
But what do you expect from someone<br>
Living next to a mall?<p>

Somehow I'll get a job<br>
Where they'll treat me right<br>
But for now I'm a mop jockey<br>
Serving urban blight for $1.50 an hour.<p>

REPEAT CHORUS<p>

I want to quit at Toast on a Lance<br>
And put food in a bag, for some real cash<p>

REPEAT AD NAUSEUM<p>
