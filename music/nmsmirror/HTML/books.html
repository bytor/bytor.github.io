Over the course of 16 albums and thousands of concerts throughout the globe
Rush have established themselves as the most popular heavy metal and
progressive rock trio in the world. Their unique blend of power rock and
intelligent lyrics has won them a following as devoted as any in rock.<p>

This first and only official biography follows the career of Geddy Lee, Alex
Lifeson and Neil Peart from their earliest days as a Toronto bar band
performing cover versions of sixties rock to their most recent LP 'Hold Your
Fire'. Along the way Rush have faced critical indifference with an
uncompromising stance that has justly increased their popularity.<p>

Author Bill "B-Man" Banasiewicz, perhaps their number one fan, has followed the
fortunes of Rush over a decade and is a personal friend of the band and their
associates.
