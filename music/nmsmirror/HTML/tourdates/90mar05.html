<font size=+1>Rush: Seeking platinum for the 8th time</font><br>
<b>by David Surkamp</b><p>

SIXTEEN years into its career, the Toronto-based rock trio Rush
is producing some of its most exciting and provocative music yet.
The trio's current album, "Presto," is following the path of its
last seven consecutive albums by pressing quickly into the Top 10
on Billboard. <p>

The three Canadians have managed to produce their technically
challenging and intricate music in such a way that its albums
always reach platinum status. That dichotomy is no easy task in
the real world of rock 'n' roll. <p>

However, since the release of its last studio album, 1987's "Hold
Your Fire," the band has undergone a few significant changes.
While the lineup of singer/bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex
Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart remains rock solid, there has
been a change in record labels and producers. However, for Rush
it is business as usual. In fact, the band's most immediate
concerns the afternoon Peart telephoned were sorting out the
gremlins that seem to plague all outfits in the early days of a busy
touring schedule. <p>

"No matter how well-rehearsed a band and crew may be," Peart
said, "there are always the occasional surprises during the first
few performances. Rush hasn't been on stage since our last tour
ended in June 1988. It was the longest time off the road in our
career, and there were various technical loose ends to be tied up.
However, it feels so good to be performing again, these
inconveniences are barely worth noting. And as important as the
recording process is to one's career, there is simply nothing like
performing in a concert situation. It is such an immediate
transference of energy." <p>

When Rush performs at The Arena March 5, it will play five of the
songs from "Presto." It will be interesting to hear the transition
of the songs from recording to concert versions. <p>

On its debut Atlantic album release, Rush and producer Rupert
Hine have returned to the group's power base for the foundation
of its material. They have utilized the inherent impact of such an
arrangement with considerable effect. <p>

While there are still the keyboard padding, the simple slam-bang
of stripped-down guitar, bass and drum on "Presto," the total
sound has more in keeping with early Led Zeppelin than some of
the more esoteric influences supposedly linked to Rush's
progressive style. <p>

The choice of Hine on "Presto" is especially significant. Not only
is he the producer of more 70 than albums by prominent acts such
as Tina Turner, Howard Jones, The Fixx and Stevie Nicks, but he
also has recorded 15 albums under his own name. Like some
other producermusicians, his impact is obvious. <p>

"We have been wanting to work with Rupert Hine since the time
of our 'Grace Under Pressure' recording sessions in 1984," Peart
said. "Consequently, when our former producer, Peter Collins,
was unable to rejoin us on the recording of the new album, it was
very fortunate that Rupert had time free. He brought along his
regular working partner, Steven Tayler, and they proved to be the
perfect production team to help us polish the arrangements on the
new material. <p>

"Since we have enough recording experience under our belts to
have a pretty good idea of where we want to take a particular piece
of music, we don't need to be led through the process. Rupert is
an accomplished vocalist and keyboard player and possesses a
musical point of view that many producers cannot fathom. In fact,
he was particularly helpful with the arranging of vocal harmonies.
He can be heard singing on some of them. <p>

"We returned to the process of composing on guitar, bass and
drums for the first time in years," Peart continued. "On the past
few Rush albums, most of the songs were started while we were
sitting around Geddy's keyboard rig and the influence of the
keyboard can be heard in some chord progressions. On 'Presto',
the songs were more often inspired by a guitar or bass riff, and we
went on with that as the basis for our arrangements." <p>

<font size=+1>Rush brings plenty of power to stage</font><br>
<b>by Louise King</b><p>

FORGET all your preconceived notions about rock concerts. Not
since Pink Floyd has a group redefined the experience like Rush
did Monday night at The Arena. Even if the Canadian trio's brand
of hard rock isn't your cup of tea, the flawlessly executed show,
complete with brilliant sound and lighting systems, as well as an
array of lasers and other special effects, was worth the price of
admission. <p>

After 16 years, it's still amazing the kind of power these three
individuals can bring to bear on a concert stage. Great crashing
waves of sound flooded the nearly sold-out hall as Geddy Lee
easily manipulated bass and keyboards, while guitarist Alex
Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart added their own special punch.
While the use of synthesizers helped the band approximate the
recorded versions of its songs, there were enough impromptu
moments in the set, most notably during Lifeson's solos, to
maintain the audience's attention. <p>

Touring behind their 1989 LP, "Presto," the three handled their
chores with great dexterity and panache. The interplay between
drums and bass, most evident in "Show Don't Tell" was classic
Rush, and the instrumental virtuosity was as evident in the
three-minute radio hits off this album as it was during the couple
of multi-layered suites the band threw in for good measure, lest
we forget its early days. <p>

Of the new material, "Super Conductor" got the most involved
send-off, complete with varilights that dropped from the overhead
trusses on accordian-like hangers, video images just this side of
surreal, and the use of speakers in the rear of the hall which
created a truly quadrophonic sound. The attention-getter of the
evening, however, was the magical appearance of a pair of giant
rabbits during "War Paint." <p>

Surprisingly, Lee had no trouble being heard, even on tough
numbers like "Marathon" and "Subdivisions," two standout
tunes in a career brimming with equally expressive songs. And,
while it was a nice surprise to find the ultimate Rush classic,
"Tom Sawyer" in the set after all these years, the trio still loses
points for omitting "Spirit of Radio" this time around. <p>

Opening the show was Mr. Big, a better-than-average heavy metal
quartet that derives most of its worth from a convincing display of
instrumental technique, including a bass solo executed as if on a
classical guitar, and a bass/guitar duel that saw the musicians
match each other, note for note, until it passed impressive and
bordered on the self-indulgent. <p>
