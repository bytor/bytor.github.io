<font size=+1>Arena rock's Rush shows staying power</font><br>
<b>by Sara Sherr</b><p>

If anybody can prove arena rock is still viable in 1996, it's Rush.
For two decades, the Canadian trio has updated its sound without
embarrassing itself. In the '70s, Rush defined metal. In the '80s, its
classic rock effectively absorbed new wave and post-punk.<p>

And in the '90s, frontman/bassist Geddy Lee, drummer Neil Peart and
guitarist Alex Lifeson are a better grunge band than their younger
counterparts, who most likely have a few Rush albums in their collection.<p>

Rush is the best of both worlds: They're musicians' musicians who also
manage to be heroes to suburban boys and their grown-up brothers.<p>

At the sold-out CoreStates Center on Wednesday night, Rush displayed equal
parts musicianship and showmanship for three hours. The program reflected
all the phases of the band's career: material from the new Test for Echo
("Driven," "Virtuality"),
the classic-rock power ballad "Closer to the Heart," the post-punk funk
of "Force 10," the individualist hit "Tom Sawyer," and the Rush Holy
Grail, the entire 21-minute "2112." The anthemic "Free Will," with its
line "If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice,"
resonated with apathetic voters the day after the election.<p>

Lee -- whose wail has been likened to "a choir of angels" by SCTV
characters Bob and Doug MacKenzie and a screeching banshee by nonfans --
has developed a palatable style somewhere in between the two.<p>

When he sings "Invisible airwaves crackle with light" in "Spirit of
Radio," he sounds like radio static. But even when Lee is screechy, he
compensates with bass playing that is agile and funkier than he looks.
The revered Peart, who is also the band's lyricist, did a drum solo that
used jazz, African and Latin rhythms, accompanied by historical movie clips
of dancers.
And Lifeson was in his glory for "Spirit of Radio," which includes one of
the most famous riffs in classic rock.<p>

The high point of the night was Rush's synth-laden "Subdivisions." When
Lee, now in his 40s, first sang "be cool or be cast out" in 1982, he was
talking to all the lonely guys in suburban cul-de-sacs who failed to fit in
and who spent their time in the
basement bonding with their stereo equipment and conquering hard-to-play
riffs.<p>

For them, Peart, Lee and Lifeson will always be superheroes, even without
costumes and makeup.
