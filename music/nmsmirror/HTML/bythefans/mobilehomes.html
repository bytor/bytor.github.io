Well you can fill that tank<br>
Good wheels are the key to good tourin'<br>
Campers take less space<br>
Boats, they seldom clear the bank<br>
If they don't think it's rank<br>
Then pack the kids, don't tell the detination<br>
Give them bags and tents<br>
And make 'em sleep down where it's dank<p>

We go out on the road and take our houses<br>
Lock up the house, leave it to the mouses<br>
We buy those little lap dogs for our spouses!<p>

Mobile Homes<p>

Don't hit that deer!<br>
You hit the deer.<br>
Mobile Homes<br>
Our bikes were stolen<br>
So was the coleman<br>
Mobile Homes<p>

Well dinner's cold as ice-<br>
Mom just had to ruin our supper<br>
To tend to little Billy<br>
And his head of lice<br>
Well, wouldn't space be nice?<br>
I'm sick and tired of bunking with my sister<br>
She got sick from Poison Ivy<br>
and the threw up twice.<p>

Kids- relax<br>
Just eat your Apple Jacks<br>
The variety packs<br>
and PB Max<br>
Even though there's a tax on all those snax<br>
Just Relax<br>
Makin' fat that gluteus max<br>
Those are the facts- you dig?<br>
You scarf it down<br>
your butt gets big. You're a PIG<br>
It's destructive, convulsive,<br>
Watching you's repulsive.<br>
So who's afraid<br>
of a little expansion<br>
Can't get no indigestion<br>
You got gas!<br>
You'd better not pass boy,<br>
It spreads fast<br>
In a Mobile Home boy!<p>

What's the deal?<br>
Hear it squeal!<br>
If the brakes are hot- better stop!<br>
Cool 'em down and try to flag a cop<br>
If you're stallin'<br>
Or you're tires are baldin'<br>
Don't go callin'<br>
Tripple A while bawlin'<br>
They're slow as mold. It's cold<br>
Gott a massive loan<br>
To go out and buy this Mobile Home<br>
Turn the key and ROLL<br>
Back on the road!<p>

Get Sleazy!<p>
