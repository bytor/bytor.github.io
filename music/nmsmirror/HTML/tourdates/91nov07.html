<font size=+1>Rush: lesson in how to avoid pitfalls of rock 'n' roll </font><br>
<b>by Paul A. Harris</b><p>

WHEREVER they fall in the big rock 'n' roll picture, you have to
concede to the Canadian trio, Rush, some points for longevity. In
1991, band members released their 18th album, their 14th studio
recording and marked their 16th anniversary of performing with
the current lineup. <p>

"We have felt a new kind of realization," said Neil Peart, the
band's remarkably erudite drummer and lyricist, in a recent phone
interview. Rush will perform at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 7 at the The
Arena. <p>

"There is a long future ahead of us because we are so satisfied
with working together. There isn't an area of frustration for any of
us - something that we don't get to express in Rush." <p>

He went on to explain that strategy and a familiarity with the
pitfalls of big time rock 'n' roll have helped Rush to survive.
"There's one pretty helpful thing between the three of us," he
explained. "The roles are clearly defined. <p>

"I write the lyrics, and the other two write the music. So, right
from day one, there's sort of a series of assignments: I'll go in that
room and write some lyrics, and you two guys go in that room
and write some music. And at the end of the day, we'll get
together and see what we can merge." <p>

Peart's approach to lyric writing will likely widen the eyes of
anyone who entertains stereotyped images of rock drummers.
"Roll the Bones," Rush's latest longplayer, is riddled with
literary references that range from the highbrow fiction of
American novelist John Barth ("Lost in the Funhouse" and
"Tidewater Tales") to science fiction writer Kevin Anderson. <p>

To Peart, lacing rock songs with literary references keeps the
work interesting. It also affords him a novel means to process the
people and ideas he finds fascinating. <p>

"I try to make those things not so important," he elaborated.
"They're there for people who are interested in stuff like that. <p>

"I try to plant the references, using them just to entertain myself.
If they don't reach an interested reader or listener, then it's
probably a failure on my part. <p>

"I try to look at different, experimental ways to communicate
things and, at the same time, I'm looking for the most effective
way to communicate them." <p>

Peart's approach to the drum kitalso entails more than might
initially reach the ear. <p>

"You spend a lot of time learning the craft," he said. "Then,
once you start to get reasonably confident of your tools, you look
at different ways to apply them. <p>

"I played a concert earlier this year with the Buddy Rich big band,
where I was among six drummers. And for one thing, it gave a
rebirth to my love of big band music. <p>

"Since then, it's not only been a course of study, to learn about
doing it, but I've gone back through all the CD collections of
Count Basie and Duke Ellington, and I have a whole new
appreciation of that." <p>

Most of all, Peart attributes Rush's continued success to
calculation, luck and a slow, steady rise. He knows that big time
rock 'n' roll has caused more than a few good bands to split up.
He compares his band's legacy to that of an ensemble quite close
to the hearts of the St. Louis rock fans. <p>

"We spent many years opening shows so we saw how other
bands handled it or didn't handle it," he explained. "That was
kind of an object lesson for us, and also an illustration of how
good it is to rise slowly. <p>

"I have a great deal of sympathy for bands like Guns 'n' Roses
that rise suddenly from small clubs in L.A. and, all at once,
they're the number one band in the world. <p>

"It's enormously difficult to deal with. We had five or six years to
get used to it. A band like that has five days to get used to it." <p>

<font size=+1>Rush melds showmanship, great music</font><br>
<b>by Louise King</b><p>

ANYONE fortunate enough to have seen Rush live can attest to
the fact that the Canadian hard-rock trio's concerts are more than a
musical happening; they're an audio and visual event that assaults
the senses from all sides. <p>

And based on the band's performance at The Arena Thursday
night, it appears Rush has been able to maintain the spectacular
nature of its stage show through the years without taking anything
away from its thoughtful, intelligent, highly developed musical
compositions. <p>

While some of the stunts and some of the video clips were
repeated from concerts past, the new visual effects were numerous
enough to hold the audience's attention. <p>

Chief among these were the videos displayed during the playing of
the funky title song from the group's latest disc, "Roll The
Bones." The images of skeletons, rolling dice and playing
enhanced the lyrical message of this tune and indeed the entire new
release - that no matter how well prepared we are, life is a crap
shoot, and the only way we can improve the odds is by the
choices we make. <p>

The group also made points with its choice of material - a fine mix
of vintage Rush and newer tunes. Lengthy instrumentals
accompanied by dizzying laser light displays were balanced with
synthesizer-enhanced, polyrhythmic pieces. <p>

Vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson did a
phenomenal job playing off one another, but drummer Neil Peart
really stole the show. He displayed his prowess on electronic
drum pads, then switched to a more conventional set of skins.
Finally, he augmented his drumming with digitally sampled
sounds. <p>

Guitar wunderkind Eric Johnson was the opening act. His
dexterous fingering and almost magical ability to achieve
otherworldly tones by bending notes as far as they will go puts
him in a class by himself. Like a jazz musician, he frequently
strays from the main theme of his compositions, taking us on new
and exciting adventures before returning to the familiar melody. <p>

The highlight of the 40-minute set was Johnson's lengthy
introduction to "Cliffs of Dover," which is not heard on the radio
version of the tune. <p>
