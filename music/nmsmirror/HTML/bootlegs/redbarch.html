This CD is one of the many that are merely a copy of the "Exit Stage Left"
video/laserdisc soundtrack. The others (Red Stars, A New Reality) have the
exact track listing as this one. This one, however, doesn't contain the
voice-overs by Neil like the other two do. This was accomplished by some
interesting splicing (including a nasty cut at the beginning of "Tom 
Sawyer").<p>

It almost sounds like it's from an lp, pops are evident in the recording, or it
could just be the recording level set too high. At times they are annoying
enough to make you ignore the music in favor of the background noise. To be
fair though, the transition between "The Trees" and "Xanadu" is very lovely
and VERY extended.<p>

The packaging is pathetic. Not one picture of the band graces this cd, but
plenty of cars and car parts do. Yes, the picture is of a barchetta and it is
red, but that's as far as the relationship goes. And since when does Neil
perform vocals? The date is also incorrectly listed as May 1981. On the front
they had the audacity to print "Limited Edition 1000 Copies", then inside
write something in Italian which basically says that the band asked them to
stop printing it, which they did. I think they merely changed companies, as
this was originally released under the label Rarities & Few (RFCD 1055). Hm,
that license plate on the car looks familiar...<p>

Don't rush out and buy this. It's merely a recording of something you probably
have already, cleverly chopped and faded to make it seem like it is indeed 
a legitimate concert recording.<p>
