I knew it was whiter than those other candy bars<br>
I withstood the mocking from my friends, both near and far<br>
Six inches of whiteness -- at least on the outside<br>
But inside was milky chocolate, a great new candy star!<p>

Since the wrapper was faulty, I ripped it apart<br>
When I tasted this sweet thing, I joyfully thanked the Quickie Mart<p>

But it's nobody's Zero<br>
Lonely near the counter, a very neglected confection<br>
Zero<br>
Landed at the register, ideal of candy bar perfection<br>
Zero<br>
Not Snickers, Milky Way, or wimpy Three Musketeers<br>
Zero<br>
This humble little candy bar could proudly kick their chocolate rears<br>
But nobody remembers to buy a<br>
Zero!<p>

I didn't know the clerk, but I knew his taste in treats<br>
The local sugar expert, he had lost 'bout half his teeth<br>
Still he grimaced smartly when his customers bought some Twix<br>
It was all that he could do to prevent himself from getting sick<p>

As the delivery truck pulled in, at a quarter past midnight<br>
I staked out the Circle-K and knew my urge would be met that night<p>

'Cause I'm a fan of<br>
Zero<br>
This quiet candy bar<br>
Ruled through most of the '80s<br>
Zero<br>
Competing with the Kit-Kats, yet favored by men and ladies<br>
Zero<br>
Not a bawdy Reggie, or disgusting Almond Joy<br>
Zero<br>
Deserves to be the candy mascot for every girl and boy<br>
Too bad no one's buying<br>
Another Zero<p>

As I paid my dollar, I gave out a holler<br>
When I realized that I had enough change to buy another!<br>
Another Zero!<br>
Not your average candy, with quite an unorthodox name<br>
Zero<br>
Sits lonely in the Quik Trip, calling other candy names<br>
Zero<br>
There's no glorious mantra, by which you'll know this fine bar<br>
Zero<br>
Seldom brought by Santa, leaving many stockings subpar<br>
Since he's never buying<br>
Nobody's Zero!<p>
