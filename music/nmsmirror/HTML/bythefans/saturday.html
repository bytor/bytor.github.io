<font size=+3>Saturday Glory</font><br>
by John Dea<br>
<em>July 24, 1994</em>
<p>

On the field where nobody laughs<br>
And nobody sleeps<br>
On the field where Coach starts crying<br>
When the offense creeps<br>
The quarterback starts moving<br>
But he isn't very fast<br>
Tries to throw the pass<br>
But he's knocked to the grass<p>

Coach just grabs him by the arm<br>
"Can't you run at all?<br>
 I'll decide what to do with you later<br>
 Right now try to move the ball"<br>
No matter what they play...<p>

Thousands of people<br>
At today's game<br>
Off-season's promise<br>
Shot down in flames<p>

After a halftime<br>
Of Coach's inspiring stories<br>
Run from the field house<br>
To play for Saturday glory<p>

On the campus where people agree<br>
That Football is King<br>
On the campus where athlete's never<br>
Have to learn anything<p>

Just one spark of potency<br>
From their offensive line<br>
One show of strength and unity<br>
And then the whole team can shine<br>
No matter what they play...<br>
No matter whay they play...<p>

If the clock is running down<br>
And the winner takes it all<br>
If their team is in control<br>
We'll just have to take the ball<br>
Though we're running out of time<br>
And their team is up by four<br>
Though their team has got the ball<br>
We must find a way to score<p>
