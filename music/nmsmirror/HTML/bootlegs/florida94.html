If you thought Storm in St. Petersburg was bad, you'll definitely want to pass
this one up. Not only is it the exact same shows, in the exact same order,
with the exact same awful sound, but the packaging is even worse. Avoid this
one!<p>

Although this does contain the entire Counterparts show, the sound quality if
pitiful. The crowd comes through better than the music itself; in some places
it sounds like they were yelling for the purpose of being recorded on tape.
The band is very muffled and distant; the bass seems to come through pretty
well, but the guitar usually doesn't.<p>

This cd also contains several songs from an RTB show, which could have
redeemed it. The sound quality of these songs is just as poor as the CP show,
and sound more tinny. It's also missing most of the volume out of the left
channel.<p>

The cover is actually neat, with pictures of the band overlaid onto the inside
of a car (looks to be driven on the right side, judging by the position of the
steering wheel), perhaps the "red barchetta"? Other than that, there is no
packaging to speak of, and since when does Alex Lifesome play in the band?
And unlike most double cds, this comes in a large double case, instead of the
slim flip one popular now.<p>

This boot is the same as the "Storm in St. Petersburg" cd. Why this was
released is beyond me. Don't fall into the bootlegger's trap and buy both,
save your money for something worthwhile!<P>
