    Recently, an "Ask A Pro" question crossed my desk that was not easily
answerable in 25 words or less, so I thought: "Aha! Here's another excuse
for an article." But here -- you'll see what I mean:
<p>
    "Your ability to play in odd times, play odd accents, and insert your
fills in the most peculiar -- yet proper -- places is surpassed by none. To
follow some of your more difficult music exactly seems (at my level)
impossible! My question is: While you are playing, how do you think ahead
to what you will play next? More specifically, do you 'think by numbers'?
Do you 'hear' the upcoming riff in your mind? Do you see the 'hardcopy' of
your music in your mind, or do you just let it flow? Can you give me any
advice on a workable mental tract to use while playing?"

<p>
    Now, aside from adding to my wonder about why I get so many letters
from Toms River, New Jersey, and making me blush with embarrassment, you
can see that there's plenty of "food for thought" here. Many drummers'
minds will start to whirl when they think about these things, and I think
all of Matt's assertions are, or can be true.
<p>
    But let's start at the beginning: with the numbers. Of course, it's
never too early to learn to count, a skill that you'll need forever. So it
makes sense that when you first begin to dabble in odd times, or even learn
to flow well in 4/4 or 6/8, counting will teach you the "program." As you
become more fluent in different rhythmic foundations, you will be able to
recall these "hardwired programs," to set you into the right "cadence," or
to let you pick up the "odd" beats at different times. I've written about
this before, so I won't give it too much emphasis now, but you learn to
subdivide the time signatures into their even-and-odd components, or to
multiply them to make a series of odd bars add up to one long, even one.
This is a trick I have used many times, playing 4/4 over 7/8, 5/4, or 6/8,
and just holding the rhythm chugging along until all the bar lines add up
again, and I can take off somewhere else!
<p>
    There is another thing, too -- a wordless mental "language" that I use
to understand and remember parts. Certain phrases even have a kind of
picture symbol; not notation, or the physical move, but an inner image of
the effect of some little technique or rhythmic twist. So in that sense, I
don't hear the upcoming phrase in my mind so much as see it. This, by its
very nature, is unfortunately not communicable to others. I guess that's
why we have written music!
<p>
    But let's get into the really deep waters of this question. All of the
above will set you up for comfortable improvising, but what if you want to
arrange a drum part, one that will stand forever as the definitive way of
playing a song? (I know, I know...dream on!) Starting from ground zero, you
have a blank slate -- a new song -- and a drum part to create for it. So
you play detective, look for clues, put two and two together -- and come up
with seven. (Always a good answer!)
<p>
    But the clues. Perhaps the songwriter will play you a rough tape. On
it, there will be some indication of the tempo, whether it's from a drum
machine or in the inherent "lilt" to the music as it's played. Then there
will be dynamic hints: how the song builds, where you might want to make
the strongest statement, where you can be subtle and supportive, and where
you might add some rhythmic interest. What does the song need? Where are
the vocal parts, the instrumental parts, the choruses, the bridges? These
are all the building blocks, not only of the song, but also of your part in
it.
<p>
    So you mind starts to sift possibilities: perhaps a big backbeat on the
3 for the verses, maybe a quarter-note bass drum with 16ths on the hi-hat
for the chorus. And those bridges: Let's try a driving 2 and 4 on the
snare, with a quarter-note ride, to build into the chorus, and then plane
out under the vocals. And I think we could do some clever stuff in that
intro to the instrumental: Bring it down and play across the time, with
lots of those "ghost notes" that Rod Morgenstein is always talking about.
<p>
    Listen to the song another couple of times, mentally going over your
"map" of the musical terrain and trying to cement the arrangement details
in your head. Again, people use different ways to accomplish this, and all
are good. It doesn't matter if you write out some notation (or use the kind
of "shorthand" that many drummers do), or if you're able to rough it out in
your head just from memory. In this case, if it works, it's right! Is the
song dark and introverted, or is it light and airy? Do you want to be able
to dance to it, or is it "just for the ears"? Does your band's common
stylistic ground run to samba, ska, swing, or speed metal? What sorts of
fills are appropriate, and where are they appropriate? And if you're
playing speed metal, can you introduce some ideas from ska, samba, or swing
that might make it more interesting? This is where the fun starts.
<p>
    Inevitably, it's going to be rough the first few times, especially if
you and the rest of the band are all trying to learn the song at once. If
you can do some experimenting with it at home, even if it's just on
magazines to your Walkman, more to the good. But if you're diving right
into it, again there are two approaches. Some people start as simply as
possible. Then, if they feel compelled to add to that minimalist approach,
they will. Other people start the opposite way -- trying everything they
can possibly think of in the first few run throughs, then gradually
eliminating the ideas that don't work. There's much to be said for either
approach. In the first case, you'll interfere with the rest of the band
less, and you'll come up with a good, conservative part. In the second
instance, however, you're more likely to stumble into something original
and unexpected, and if you have the luxury or working by yourself, it's at
no one else's expense. This is, I suppose, the ideal. (Sadly, our world
doesn't tend toward the ideal, and if others are complaining about all the
noise you're making, you may not make many friends. And let's face it: In
this business, you need friends, and you should certainly not alienate the
bass player! So be nice.)
<p>
    The big word here: <strong>LISTEN</strong>. As you play the song, take time out from
your explorations of outer space to listen to what your friend, the bass
player, is getting at, and to see how the other instruments are responding
to your rhythmic input. There may be something nice happening that will
trigger other directions for you. One of the wonderful things about working
with other musicians is coming up with something together. When the whole
band gets excited about something, you just know it's going to work,
because everybody will be happy, feel part of this holistic experience, and
play their fingers off. 
<p>
    But there are still many options open to you. Much will depend upon
your own temperament as a player. What sort of situation makes you most
comfortable? Do you like to have your part worked out as much as possible,
so your only concern when you play or record the song is getting it right?
Some wise editor once advised an agonizing writer: "Don't get it right, get
it down!" There's something in that for musicians as well, though perhaps
not what the literary advisor meant. If you find you fly best "by the seat
of your pants" -- again, if it works, it's right. Go wild.
<p>
    I have told the story before about how I was a big Keith Moon fan as a
beginning drummer. All I wanted to do was get in a band that would play
some Who songs so I could wail like he did. But when I finally found a band
that actually wanted to play these songs, I discovered to my chagrin that I
didn't like playing like Keith Moon. It was too chaotic, and things just
weren't placed rationally. I wanted to play in a more careful, deliberate
way -- to think about what I played where, and not just "let it happen." I
am driven by a strong organizational, perfectionist demon. Of the two
extremes, I must confess I probably prefer the dull and "correct" to the
adventurous foray that doesn't quite come off. Again, that's a personal
thing, and I sure don't think I'm necessarily right. It's just the way I
am. So I'll continue along in that vein for a while -- as that's what comes
naturally -- and talk about organizing a song.
<p>
    My personal approach is fairly linear. I'll often start simply at the
beginning of the song and gradually build it -- if not dynamically, then in
terms of activity. A simple roll around the toms in chorus one might double
up in chorus two, and then by chorus three become a rip-roaring, two-bar,
triplet-feel flurry of 64th notes. Or a gentle backbeat in verse one can
develop through a Latin feel on the ride cymbal in verse two, and be echoed
by a double-time full-throttle "race to the finish" during the rideout.
Then there are accents, pushes, hi-hat chokes, sudden pauses, feel-shifts,
staccato punctuations, downbeats on the toms instead of the snare, leaving
the downbeat out, or emphasizing the upbeats on the ride pattern. There's
also something I hear Manu Katche doing with Peter Gabriel and Robbie
Robertson: insinuating the rhythm -- playing all around the beat without
actually playing it, but it's absolutely there. This gets more complicated,
but also more fun, and is very satisfying when you pull it off (not only
for yourself, but for the song, the other musicians, and, hopefully, the
audience.
<p>
    People so often seem to forget that an audience doesn't have to
understand the music to enjoy it. How many of the millions of people who
loved Pink Floyd's song "Money" and bought the <strong><u>Dark Side Of The 
Moon</u></strong>
album knew -- or cared -- that it was in 7/4? Peter Gabriel's "Solsbury
Hill" again is in seven, and is one of the cleverest maskings of odd time
-- and just happened to be a big hit for him. The time signature just
didn't matter; the musicians used skill and musicality to make it feel
good, and that's what the audience responded to. That's what
"accessibility" is really all about: communicating the thing properly.
That's your ultimate responsibility, and your ultimate blame. Sure, there
are no black-and-white absolutes in music, (or almost none), but it
sometimes happens that a great song doesn't "click" with people because it
just wasn't put together right. The listeners might not be able to
articulate the flaw, and neither may the musicians. But if it doesn't reach
the people you would have expected to like it, the song just didn't
connect. So it's up to us to make the connections.
