There is stuff coming out of my truffels<br>
Connect with confection<br>
Eat what teens have eaten<br>
Vent the oven for convection<p>

There's some glue and a slug in my glucose<br>
Bakers bask and bake<br>
The chocolate is mostly cocoa<br>
A part they couldn't partake<p>

There is no wet stew in my sweets<br>
Stem the flow of steam from the meats<br>
My stomache starts to ache<br>
I need a breakfast break<p>

My least worry is a large waistline<br>
Rotund, though some would say round<br>
Proud to drop an apple pie<br>
A large foundation's what I've found<p>

Take care don't mar the caramel<br>
The molasses some would slam<br>
Take care when you crave it<br>
Race with caramel when you cram<p>

My appetite is not quite petite<br>
Defeat whatever I eat<br>
My stomache starts to ache<br>
I need a breakfast break<p>

Popsicles will leave their spoils<br>
Some will munch more s'mores<br>
He and she work for Hershey(R)<br>
But a smart one toils at Mars(TM)<p>

Sweet are the sweets we wrestle<br>
No bitter bite for our tribe<br>
Luscious for our soul<br>
To rid; we drivel when we drive<p>

I taste the sour state of sweet tarts<br>
Some rat broke my tart into parts<p>

Don't think I'm thin<br>
Are twinkies such a sin?<p>
