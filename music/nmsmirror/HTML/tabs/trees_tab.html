intro
D    F#m   C#m    A
E    G     A   Bm Bm  A D Bm


         D             F#m
There is unrest in the forest,
         C#m              A
There is trouble with The Trees,
        E                G
For the Maples want more sunlight
A       Bm   Bm A   D     Bm
And the Oaks ignore their pleas.


The measure is 3/4 here.

     A                B
The trouble with the Maples,
             G        D             A
And they're quite convinced the're right
              A                 B
They say the Oaks are just too lofty
          G       D       A
And they grab up all the light.
         A                     B
But the Oaks can't help their feelings
         G        D           A
If they like the way they're made.
          F#
And they wonder why the Maples
          G
Can't be happy in their shade.

Time changing to 3/4 again (or 6/8)

          D              F# 

There is trouble in the forest,
         C#m                A
And the creatures all have fled,
        E             G           A 

As the Maples scream `Oppression`
         Bm         Bm [a few times]
And the Oaks just shake their heads

repeat this chord scheme. Then play the Bm for two bars instead of
one and move into the solo. Get a drummer with woodblocks :-)

        A               B
So the Maples formed a union
     G        D     A
And demanded equal rights.
      A                 B
"The Oaks are just too greedy;
         G         D       A
We will make them give us light."
             A           B
Now there's no more Oak oppression,
          G        D     A
For they passed a Noble Law,
         F# F# F# (you get the idea)
And the Trees are all kept equal
    G G G (etc)       A
By hatchet, axe, and saw.
