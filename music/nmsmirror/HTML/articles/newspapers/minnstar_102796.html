<font size=+1>"Echo" has more than one meaning</font><br>
<br>

In typically complex fashion, the title song of the new album by the
intellectual Canadian rock trio Rush has a dual meaning.  On the
surface, "Test for Echo" is a snide critique of the U.S. justice system,
which sometimes turns criminals into media darlings.  But it's also a
comment on human nature.<p>

"It's about the numbing process that happens when we are exposed to
great tragedies and then we're exposed to moments of hilarity," said
singer-bassist Geddy Lee, whose band returns Tuesday to Target Center
in Minneapolis.  "I feel that that's the condition of contemporary man
now -- when we read the paper or when we watch TV, we're not sure if
we're supposed to laugh."<p>

Rush separated for a year and a half after the tour supporting its
last album, "Counterparts," ended.  Drummer Neil Peart put together a
tribute album called "Burning for Buddy," which honored late drummer
Buddy Rich.  Guitarist Alex Lifeson formed the band Victor and
released an album.  And Lee and his wife became parents of a daughter.<p>

When it came time to rejoin, everyone was rejuvenated, especially Lee.
"I had had a great year and a half with my family, and I had been pretty
well totally away from the music business, so my natural cynicism of all
things connected with the music business had subsided.  I was really ready
to work.  I was really dying to write some music.  So I wasn't going to do
anything to disturb that vibe.  I was sitting there like a kid on the first
day of camp."<p>

Lee didn't feel, as he said, that he "needed to go out and make a great
solo statement."<p>

But Lifeson and Peart came from a different perspective.<p>

"Neil's project was partly driven by charity -- all the money was
going to charity -- and it was partly driven by his love of big-band
music and his desire to explore that area of his drumming."  Lee said.
"I was very supportive of that.  Alex had been dictator of the world
on his project; he'd got a taste of running the entire show.  It was
probably more difficult for him to adjust, because he was coming from a
dictatorship back into a democracy.  The first couple of days, [we] were
kind of circling each other a little bit -- we did a lot of talking, and
then everything was fine."<p>
