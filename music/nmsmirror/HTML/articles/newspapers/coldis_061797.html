The on-site jocks from WLVQ (96.3 FM) made the announcement
while a large part of the crowd was still fighting the traffic jams
caused by flooding on I-71.<p>

The rumors about last night's show at Polaris Amphitheater were
true -- it was going to be An Evening With Rush. No warm-up
acts, just all the music from Canada's premier power trio that you
could handle.<p>

Truer words were never spoken. Unlike most performers who live
by the adage "always leave them screaming for more," the
members of Rush took to the stage at 8 p.m. and were still cooking
three hours later.<p>

In between they covered most of the highlights of their long
career. A few die-hard fans may have been disappointed that some
obscure song off a minor album hadn't been played, but they were
in the minority.<p>

The most electrifying moment of the evening came right after a
long, lighthearted "disco" instrumental finished up Closer to the
Heart.<p>

The lights went down, but just when everyone was expecting an
intermission, the album cover from 2112 (a man shielding his eyes
in front of a large, fiery pentagram -- eat your heart out Marilyn
Manson) was broadcast on the video screens onstage.<p>

Rush immediately kicked right into the first three, and arguably
the most popular, songs off the album -- 2112 Medley, Overture
and one of the all-time rock anthems, The Temples of Syrinx.<p>

Lead singer Geddy Lee might have been a little off-key during
Temples, but those high notes are probably hard to hit after years
of touring.<p>

The remainder of 2112 completed the first half of the show.
Unfortunately, like most ambitious rock 'n' roll projects (any album
that has the word Overture in a song title), there is usually a lot
more dross than gold.<p>

In this case, however, that fact was more than offset by the 24-karat 
quality of the opening trio of tunes.<p>

One of the more surprising moments of the second half of the show
was the reaction to drummer Neil Peart's solo.<p>

Most of the time, whenever the individual members of a group go
off on 20-minute solos, folks in the audience (and the other band
members) go on beer or restroom runs. Not so with Peart.<p>

It may have been that his reputation as one of rock's greatest
drummers had preceded him, but the crowd got as excited over
Peart's solo as it did for hits such as Red Barchetta.<p>

He really didn't need to do a solo. Peart's work throughout the
evening proved that his reputation as an equally talented but saner
and more well-balanced version of The Who's Keith Moon was well-earned.<p>

You might be able to find fault with some parts of the show, but
you would have to look awfully hard. All in all, it was a polished
piece of work by a band that has been around long enough to know
how to do it right.<p>
