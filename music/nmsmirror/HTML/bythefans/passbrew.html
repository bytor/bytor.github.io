Well you can drink some juice<br>
they say good health's the key to good fortune<br>
Joggers like to run<br>
Drinkers seldom leave their home<br>
But we don't like that juice<br>
and sometimes we need something more<br>
We reach into the fridge<br>
Grab another cold draft brew<p>

We go out to the store and take our chances<br>
Beer is just the fear of many parents<br>
That's why we drink beer called Narragansett<br>
Pass the Brew<p>

Why are we here?<br>
Because there's beer.<br>
Pass the brew.<br>
Why does it foam?<br>
We don't really know.<br>
Pass the brew.<p>

Beer should be cold as ice-<br>
Why do long necks taste better than cans?<br>
What more could be finer<br>
than one cold as ice.<br>
Well who would pay the price<br>
for  beers that are much too expensive.<br>
If there's some way we can drink<br>
and just control our vice.<p>

We come in from the cold and take our chances.<br>
Beer is just the fear of many parents.<br>
That is why we drink beer called Narragansett!<br>
Pass the Brew....<p>

Jack, pound two.<br>
Get busy with some brew.<br>
No drinking hats or wooden bats<br>
No cogniac in big oak vats<br>
Just the brew<br>
Gonna drink till I'm on my back.<br>
I'm seein' three of you- you dig?<br>
I move around.<br>
I can't talk straight. I take a swig.<br>
Its hopps, barly<br>
lots of carbo Charlie.<br>
So who's afraid of getting real tardy.<br>
Can't get a buzz from just a few.<br>
Better drink homeboy<br>
a brew's a brew from your freezer to your glude.<p>

What's the deal? No more beer.<br>
If the beer is hot- make it not<br>
Drink some more, show us what you got.<br>
What your holding<br>
If the beers are cold<br>
Don't get molding<br>
It makes your hand smell golden;<br>
It takes some time, to make it cold.<br>
Stop drinking Boones.<br>
The stores have a thousands different brands.<br>
So get out there and drink<br>
and pass the brew.<br>
Get Dizzy!<p>
