<font size=+1>Rush: A Heavy Metal Juggernaut</font><br>
<b>by Larry Rohter</b><p>

A group called Rush drew a full house to Lisner Auditorium Sunday night,
proving once again that the current crop of heavy metal bands is pretty
much interchangeable. This particular power trio differs from half a dozen
others plying the same trade only in one small respect -- they're Canadian,
not British or American.  <p>

Aside from that, though, Sunday night's show, which also featured the Max
Webster group, was just another self-defeating exercise in heavy metal.
There were occasional echoes of Led Zeppelin, both in bassist Geddy Lee's
vocals and Alex Lifeson's guitar riffs, but it's impossible to cite other
influences simply because Rush's music, amplified beyond the threshold of
pain, is essentially characterless.  <p>

Despite all this, Rush's 90-minute set was extremely well-received. The
highlight of the show -- if one can use that word to describe a performance
devoid of intelligence, feeling or anything else usually associated with
music -- was the heavy metal opera "2112," performed in full with various
special visual effects. Nevertheless, judging form the enthusiastic
audience response, Rush may be bound next for the Capital Center -- where
their stack of amplifiers will be less likely to drive dozens of
unsuspecting fans out into the lobby, seeking relief from the juggernaut
inside.<p>
