<font size=+1>Rush's music is boring, predictable</font><br>
<b>by Michael Eck</b><p>

ALBANY -- Nuts and bolts.<p>

In the common vernacular, "nuts and bolts" means something simple, something
down to its basics.<p>

Never afraid to embrace a cliche, Canada's premier power trio, Rush, has taken
the idea of nuts and bolts to heart on its current tour behind the 1993
release "Counterparts."<p>

Members of Rush brought their nuts and bolts with them to Albany's
Knickerbocker Arena on Tuesday night, but they left the basics and simplicity
at home -- probably lost underneath the instruction book to their latest
computerized sequencer.<p>

Now this isn't just a metaphor, mind you.<p>

They really brought their nuts and bolts with them. Really big ones. Really big
nuts and bolts onstage.<p>

The concert opened with a familiar pounding leitmotif and video of a nut and a
bolt miming the space ship coupling in the film "2001: A Space Odyssey."<p>

Rock bands and kids alike sure love that dramatic Strauss music; especially
when its accompanied by crude symbolism of the wild thing. And, hey, not just
the wild thing, but the widescreen wild thing.<p>

Of course Rush promotes the nut and bolt logos as a representation of yin and
yang, ebb and flow, and time and tide. Ah, yes, counterparts. The nut being
the Beavis to the bolt's Butt-head. But this being rock 'n' roll, boys and
girls, we all know that nuts and bolts means boys and girls. Boys and girls,
a, well, a, nutting and bolting.<p>

The big nuts and bolts onstage weren't quite so, well, tumescent with
symbolism as their (oh say it) counterparts.<p>

The big nuts and bolts onstage were more like a symbol of how stupid arena
rock always has been and how stupid it stays.<p>

Rush has always flown a banner of intelligentsia amidst the rest of the rock
'n' roll blockheads; but the fact that drummer/wordsmith Neil Peart borrows
every lyric he writes from someone else's book only proves that he's got a
library card, not a high I.Q.<p>

There's no doubt that the crazies in Rush laughed at Spinal Tap's stonehenge,
but their nuts and bolts are from the same family of ridiculous, obvious
props. And while Spinal Tap was brave enough to have a really, really gigantic
stonehenge (and moronic enough to take the tiny one they got in the movie),
Rush balks with nuts and bolts that require really only one to describe their
bigness.<p>

On the positive side, only one really is required to remark on how boring and
predictable their music has become.<p>

Take a nut, put it in a bolt. Voila! Rush.
