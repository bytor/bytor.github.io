  <font size=+2>H</font>e duly turned up to the playback at Phonogram On August 4 at 6.30
pm and we all settled down to listen. Disaster was just round the
corner. One side of the playback equipment broke down and it was a
good 15 minutes before anyone realised that we were hearing a muted,
sort of strangled version of 'A Farewell.' I got verbally murdered by
my boss but Makowski was more than generous and held nothing against
me.<p>
     
  The album was finally released worldwide in September 1977. This was
first time that a Rush album had been released in its own right in the
UK at the same time as in the States. When it came out Rush were
starting yet another American tour - but in Britain Phonogram were
doing their utmost to "break" the album, blitzing the media in every
way they could think of.<p>

  Through a combination of the brilliance of the album and the
promotional push 'Farewell' began to sell in hitherto unknown
quantities.<p>

  In the States in November three albums were certified gold on the
same day - '2ll2' 'All The World's A Stage' and 'A Farewell To Kings'.
The speed with which the latter sold is some indication of just how
much Rush had grown in America.<p>

  At the end of 1977 it was announced that Rush would be playing a
16-date tour of Britain. The stampede to the box offices was colossal
and every ticket was sold out two months ahead of the first date on
the tour - Birmingham Odeon on February 12,1978.<p>

  The British dates were, in fact, along with the American tour which
began in September 1977, part of Rush's "A Farewell to Kings" world
tour. It ended in June 1978 by which time the band had attracted well
over one million concert- goers to their shows.<p>

  As I said before, that British tour was one of the most startling,
the most revelatory I'd ever seen. The band's playing was consistently
immaculate, the sound crystal clear and the light show was quite
unlike anything I'd seen before.<p>

  The lights were operated by Rush's highly experienced tour manager,
Howard Ungerleider who had been with them before Neil Peart joined.<p>

  I first met him a few days before the Rush tour of '78. Ungerleider,
product manager Alan Phillips and myself had dinner at a restaurant
near Marble Arch, mulling over various problems or events which were
likely to arise on the tour. I was there probably just to make up the
numbers since it was Phillips and Ungerleider who had the real
responsibility.<p>

  Ungerleider, a heavyweight in size but a true gentleman in character
told us story after story about his tour managing career. One that I
recall is when he was looking after (I believe) Savoy Brown and they
were taking a domestic flight in the States. Ungerleider glanced out
of the window and noticed a pair of trousers flashing by, followed
closely by shirts and other miscellaneous objects. Someone had
forgotten to batten down the cargo door and half the band's gear took
a solo flight.<p>

  On all the occasions I met Ungerleider I'd never seen him flustered
  no mean achievement considering the amount of gear the band carted
round and the heavy responsibility which rested on Ungerleider's
shoulders.<p>

  But then Ungerleider made sure that he had good people around him
too - particularly the magnificently named Lurch who was about seven
feet tall, pretty well-built but the original gentle giant. Lurch's
cross in life was the fact that every time the band toured outside of
the States he knew he'd have to resign himself to beds which were
around a foot too short for him. One of the great pluses about Lurch
was that he had only to walk into a room and any trouble makers around
would do a double take and instantly quieten down.<p>

  Throughout that tour it was evident that the band and the road crew
were essentially a happy family - corny and cliched I know, but true.
Unlike many other bands that could be mentioned, Peart, Lee and
Lifeson never seemed to "pull rank" on any members of their crew.<p>

  During that tour I came to learn that Rush were unfailingly polite.
Occasionally interviewers from the local press would fail to show up
which usually meant a long wait in a cold room somewhere in the bowels
of a theatre. But I don't recall the band ever complaining.<p>

  <font size=+2>T</font>he nearest any of them came to it was when I set up a couple of
interviews before a show. Neil did both of them then suggested
afterwards in a quiet and reasonable tone of voice that he would
prefer interviews  to take place after shows - he needed the time
beforehand to psyche himself up.<p>

  They also seemed willing to talk about any subject. In Newcastle I
took Robin Smith from Record Mirror to see the show and do an
interview afterwards. There in the Holiday Inn - which is situated
miles out of town in a place suitably called Wideopen -  Robin settled
down to talk to the band. He noticed there were several radio
controlled model cars lying around the room and started asking about
them.<p>

  As I left him with the band Neil was merrily nattering on about how
one of Rush's favourite occupations was to race these little cars
around venues during soundchecks.<p>

  Rush were due to play two nights at Hammersmith Odeon on this tour
on Sunday and Monday, February 19 and 20. One of the stunts that
Phonogram had planned was to fly an enormous hot air ballon over
Hammersmith with Rush emblazoned all over it. Sadly, the balloon,
piloted by a really nice guy by the name of Mike Glue, wouldn't get
off the ground from its launching site in Battersea Park on the
Sunday.<p>

  <font size=+2>H</font>owever, to borrow a phrase, the balloon really did go up the
following day - thanks to NME writer Miles. The band had agreed to do
a series of interviews at their hotel, the Holiday Inn, Marble Arch on
Monday. One of the journalists to turn up was Miles - a highly rated
and highly respected writer by anyone's standards.<p>
      
  I introduced him to Neil Peart and left the two of them in spirited
discussion. One of the topics they strayed on to was Rush's political
philosophy and their fascination with the anti-collectivism of Ayn
Rand.<p>

  A week later the interview appeared in NME. I glanced at it, noting
that it was quite long and then put the magazine down to read at my
leisure. A few minutes later product manager Alan Phillips came into
my office holding the NME and asking in a choked voice "Have you seen
this?" I picked up my copy of the paper and read it through rapidly.
Miles had taken Rush to be little more than a bunch of crypto-fascists
and he was issuing stern warnings against the desirability of such a
band playing in public.<p>

  <font size=+2>I</font> was aghast. And later when Peart and the rest of the band read it
they joined me in that emotion. Of course, there's no doubt that Miles
wrote it as he saw it and there was no question of a deliberate axe
job but all the same the results looked pretty damning in print.<p>

  Eventually the fuss died down. And, while Peart still remembers the
piece and the interview vividly, he tends not to talk about it any
more. In a curious way I think Miles' article helped to establish the
band somehow.<p>

  I suppose it's just another case of there being no such thing as bad
publicity - however corny that may sound.<p>

  Aside from that piece the papers tended to be very enthusiastic
about Rush and their show. All in all it was fair to say that Rush had
broken through in Britain.<p>

  To help establish them even further Phonogram released a low price
three record set consisting of the band's first three albums and
called 'Archives'. It achieved extremely healthy sales.<p>

  At the end of their world tour Rush found themselves back home in
Canada where they were honoured with a second Juno Award, this time
for "best group of the year."<p>

  After a short break the band came back to Britain and they
hightailed it down to Rockfield studios again to work on their new
album. It was finished off in London at Advision and Trident Studios.<p>

  The new album was called 'Hemispheres' and, in hindsight, it seems
reasonable to suppose that Rush felt pressure upon themselves to bring
out both an outstanding and different album. After all, in Canada they
had earned three platinum albums and three gold, while in the States
they were riding on three gold.<p>

  'Hemispheres' was released in October 1978, and by the time December
rolled round it had already gone gold in the States.<p>

  'Hemispheres' was probably Rush's most ambitious album to date. It
was originally inspired by a book called 'Powers Of Mind' written by
Adam Smith. Neil Peart explained that Smith was a researcher who
studied the occult and various other kinds of philosophies, tried LSD,
transcendental meditation and so on.<p>

  Smith devotes one chapter in his book to the division of the brain
into hemispheres - Apollo being the right hand side of the brain and
Dionysius the left.<p>

 Side one of 'Hemispheres' is devoted to the further adventures of
 Cygnus, the character who was last seen in 'A Fare well To Kings',
 plummeting through a Black Hole in his spaceship Rocinante.<p>

  Says Peart who, of course, wrote the Iyrics for the album: "The
world he Ieaves is being ruled over by two gods who represent opposing
forces - Apollo and Dionysius. Apollo champions the force of reason
and rationale and Dionysius champions the force of instinct and
intuition. I'm taking the setting back to the dawn of creation when
there was just man not knowing who he is or why he's there.<p>
  "Apollo comes along and gives the people a shot at progress and
offers all these benefits and they say 'sure we'd like fires to warm
us in winter'.<p>
  "They follow him along and build amazing cities and get involved in
science and build beautiful things just for the sake of it. But
they're bored because they don't have an emotional attachment to the
things that they're making. They lose the knack and the interest in
doing them any more. An ennui falls over everybody and they hang out,
bored.<p>
  "They go after Dionysius who tells them what he can offer and
obviously the instinctive and artistic side of things that he offers
them - the music and dancing and love. They say 'yeah, that sounds
great after what we've had'.<p>
  "Everyone has a wonderful time, they leave the cities and just rave.
But when winter comes along they've lost the skills that would keep
them warm and that whole rational side of them doesn't function the
way it did. So the wolves and cold get to them and at that point they
break into total anarchy and chaos. That's the Armageddon section of
the song because both Apollo and Dionysis are fighting for control."<p>

  Eventually the whole problem is solved by the arrival of Cygnus. He
points out the chaos that the struggle between Apollo and Dionysius is
causing. So they appoint him as a god - the bringer of balance.<p>

 Essentially it's a classic Rush theme. Peart seems to have a horror
of human stupidity and is forever preaching that the middle ground is
the only way to go.<p>
                              
  Thus, in 'Hemispheres' there's also a track called 'The Trees' which
is about what would happen to oaks and maples should they ever act as
stupidly as people do. It can be read as a union-bashing song but I
think that only diminishes what Peart is saying - peaceful
co-existence and live and let live are all.<p>
                              
  There are just two other tracks on 'Hemispheres'. 'Circumstances'
deals with disillusion while 'La Villa Strangiato' is an instrumental,
reckoned by the band to be a musical reflection of some of the strange
dreams that Alex Lifeson is prey to. The latter piece is also
subtitled 'An Exercise In Self Indulgence' which rather gives the lie
to those people who imagine that Rush a humourless and over-pretentious
band.<p>
                                                         
  'Hemispheres' proved not to be exactly everyone's cup of tea. Geoff
Barton in Sounds, with commendable honesty, announced that he couldn't
make up his mind whether the album was the greatest or the worst thing
that Rush had done.<p>
  
  And the NME, in a convoluted and verbose review - which lumped in
'Hemispheres' with Art Bears 'Hopes And Fears' and Funkadelic's 'One
Nation Under A Groove' - found the Rush philosophy "frightening."
However, the fans appeared to have no such reticence. 'Hemispheres'
probably more than any other Rush album brought the band in touch with
a much wider audience.<p>

  Up till then they were still regarded very much in the symphonic end
of heavy metal mainstream.<p>

  'Hemispheres' seemed to make the band an appealing prospect to the
thousands of Yes and Genesis fans throughout the country.<p>

  When the album was released in October Rush started on their
'Hemispheres' world tour which was to last until June the following
year and see the band playing a startling total of 113 dates in
Canada, the States, Britain and Europe. In December 1978,
'Hemispheres' went gold in the States and in the same month Rush
played three nights at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto setting an
indoor Canadian attendance record.<p>

  In the middle of January Rush played two nights at the prestigious
New York Palladium. It's not a massive venue by north east American
rock and roll standards but to play there is recognized as an
important plateau in a rock band's career.<p>
                             
  Their dates there were reviewed by John Rockwell, the influential
rock critic of the New York Times - the first occasion, I believe,
when their existence was acknowledged by this particular august organ.<p>

  <font size=+2>R</font>ockwell didn't exactly go overboard for Rush but like most of his
predecessors, who went into the band's concerts knowing not a great
deal about them and having no particular enthusiasm for their style of
music, he emerged showing respect for the trio.<p>

  He opened his review by commenting that rock critics spend much of
their time "splashing about in the new wave but an occasional dunking
in the old wave probably wouldn't harm them any." He then dismissed
the concepts of old and new waves, commented on the size and the
enthusiasm of the crowd at their Palladium dates and added "even if
Rush feels a bit miffed about the way it's ignored by the supposed
taste-makers of rock, it can take consolation in its  audience's
enthusiasm.<p>
                                                        
  "What Rush does is play tight, energetic progressive rock with a
strong science fiction overlay." Through being a three piece, said
Rockwell, Rush kept its music uncluttered and unfussy unlike so many
other science fantasy bands.<p>

  He approved of the complexity of the parts played by Alex and Neil
and added "Mr Lee sings in a spare but unusual way - a brittle
androgynous tenor."<p>

  To his own taste Rockwell found Rush a little "busy and empty in the
manner of too many of these souped-up neo-King Crimson outfits.<p>

  "But there can be no denying that Rush answers some sort of need,
and answers it with crisp, professional dispatch."<p>

  Not exactly a rave review but one which showed respect and a deal of
understanding about what Rush were attempting to do and the numbers of
people who appreciated what Rush were doing. Although the review
doesn't exactly rate alongside the conversion of Saul on the road to
Tarsus it was the kind of press that Rush needed at the time. They
were still being ignored by the radio station people in the States at
time so coverage by well-read and respected journals was essential
alongside, of course, the massive turnouts that they were getting in
concerthalls across North America.<p>
  
  In the February edition of Circus magazine Alex Lifeson found
himself promoted to the status of a first division "heavy metal
axeman" while Rush themselves were described as "Canada's premier
pulverizers". The writer was David Fricke, a long-time chronicler of
Rush's activities in various journals, who had decided that Lifeson,
with the exception of Eddie Van Halen and Ted Nugent, was the most
charismatic and talented heavy metal guitarist North America had
produced.<p>

  Said Fricke: "Lifeson has developed a working heavy metal style
that, unlike his flagging contemporaries, isn't all power chords and
decibels.<p>
  
  The extended instrumental 'La Villa Strangiato' (from 'Hemispheres')
showcases that style with an impressive technical display of not only
his playing but how well he shoulders the responsility of filling
melodic and harmonic holes in a three piece format."<p>

  Fricke later quotes Geddy Lee saying (of Alex): "yeah he's got a lot
of weight on his shoulders but no more than Neil and I. For our music
to work we have to have a rhythm section that's always happening. And
that's what sets us apart from other power trios - we have a lot
happening in the rhythm section, lots of changes, even melodies."<p>

  The second week in February saw Sounds magazine in England
announcing a "Rush, Nugent, Aerosmith Blitzkrieg" - which was another
way of saying that they'd got wind of projected British tours planned
by these three acts. Rush, they said, were scheduled to play more than
15 dates in 10 cities in England and Scotland - but dates were to be
confirmed. They added that Rush had been touring America extensively
since the release of 'Hemispheres' in November.<p>

  A week later the news was confirmed. The band was set for 18 dates
during April and May of 1979 - three nights at London's Hammersmith
Odeon, two apiece at Newcastle, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool,
Birmingham and Bristol and one-offs at Edinburgh, Coventry and
Southampton. The original plan was for them to do 36 dates, such was
the demand by fans, but the band felt that they couldn't cope with
such a large addition to an already exhausting schedule which they had
set themselves.<p>

  After all, apart from Britain the band were also lined up to play
dates in Germany, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Belgium and Finland in a
six week sell-out tour.<p>

  Eventually, the number of nights they ended up playing at
Hammersmith Odeon was five - a remarkable achievement for any band.
Incidentally, before they set off for the tour they were awarded yet
another Juno in Canada for being "Best Group Of The Year" and when
they got to London they were presented with a silver disc for sales in
Britain of 'A Farewell To Kings'.<p>

  I paid a flying visit to Glasgow on April 25 to see Rush playing the
prestigious Glasgow Apollo. It was very much a Canadian night out in
the massive but run-down Scottish venue with Rush proteges Max Webster
opening the show.<p>

  <font size=+2>I</font>t was the first visit to Europe for The Websters and it was only
natural that they should be accompanying Rush since they all grew up
together. Moreover they shared the same management company.<p>

  Max Webster: Kim Mitchell (guitar and vocals), Dave Myles (bass),
Terry Watkinson (keyboards), Gary McCracken (drums) and Pye Dubois
(Iyricist and fifth member of the band, without actually ever
appearing with them on stage), had been in existence since 1973,
having originally been formed by Mitchell and Dubois.<p>

  They'd signed with Mercury, the record company who also looked after
Rush, but had suffered in comparison. Mitchell and Dubois had told me
earlier that week that Rush had been very much the favoured sons as
far as Mercury had been concerned while Max Webster had been treated
as second best.<p>

  "But Rush themselves turned out to be a real help to us. We toured
with them a couple of times in America," said Mitchell "and they were
terrific. They helped us to play in front of a lot more people than we
might have expected."<p>

  By the time The Websters came to the UK in 1979 they had switched to
another record company, Capitol, who were pulling out all the stops to
impress. Perhaps they had a weather eye on Rush, in the hope that
their contract with Phonogram was soon to expire. Whatever, Capitol
did their best for Max Webster and, at the time, I recorded that they
played a fine and imaginative set which, given a degree of justice in
the world, would have gone a long way to establishing them in Britain.<p>

  But, at the same time, I also went on record as saying that at the
Apollo - and, as it turned out, everywhere else - the night belonged
to Rush.<p>

  They had rarely been in such magnificent form, made all the more
impressive by the fact that all three of the Rush guys had succumbed
to heavy colds within hours of touching down in Britain.<p>

  As usual, the light show was magnificent which meant that Rush had
to do their usual outstanding job as far as the musical side of the
evening was concerned.<p>

  <font size=+2>T</font>hey not only achieved that, but in actual fact surpassed it.
Despite the fact that they played for more than two hours, despite the
fact that we all stood for the whole of that time, despite the heat,
the over-powering volume, the smoke, the lack of oxygen - despite all
this by the time the band had left the stage for the last time I felt
as though they'd played for about five minutes. I could see people all
round me looking as though they shared that impression. Heads shaken
from side to side as though they'd just come out of a trance, people
sneaking glances at watches and adopting weird expressions of
surprise.<p>

  Rush had incorporated a substantial chunk of 'Hemispheres' into
their set, alongside standards and gems from earlier albums.<p>

  The set included 'Anthem', 'By-Tor And The Snow Dog', 'Xanadu', 'The
Trees', 'Cygnus X-1', 'Hemispheres', 'La Villa Strangiato', 'Bangkok',
'Twilight Zone', 'Something For Nothing', the full '2112', 'Working
Man', 'Bastille Day', and 'In The Mood'.<p>

  Reviews in the music press varied. Melody Maker and Sounds were
decidedly approving, while Record Mirror were less than enthusiastic,
a publication called Popstar Weekly ended their "review" with the
slogan "Canucks go home" and NME reacted predictably.<p>

  One Glenn Gibson declared Rush "riddled with unforgiveable faults"
and concluded that "During any lull in the explosions and whirling
lights the band seemed as though they'd be booed off in a pub. That
was the only time you ever noticed them."<p>

  Gibson's critical premise seemed based on the fact that Rush placed
an awful lot of stress on visual effects and, as such, were fair game
for castigation. On the one side declaring the overall effect as
"almost awe-inspiring", Gibson tempered this almost grudging praise
with the suggestion since Rush had enough money to hire the best
people in the world to provide these visual effects, they were
guaranteed to come up with "some worthy aspects to the show."<p>

  A confused review, but one indicative of the critical climate at the
time, which tended to be almost unanimous in the view that anyone like
Clash was ideologically pure and therefore their music was wonderful,
whereas as someone like Rush - definitely politically suspect -
automatically had to come out with duff music<p>

  If the present reader feels that many critics of the time got their
only exercise from jumping to conclusions he wouldn't be too far off the
mark.<p>

  If only NMEs Gibson had known Rush had plans to make the eye-
dazzling parts of their show even more supernova. At the time Neil
Peart told me that the intention was for Rush to treat their British
fans to the nearest thing they could manage to their American touring
set-up, given the vastly different sizes of the venues they played
either side of the Atlantic.<p>

  One thing the British fans hadn't seen which the North Americans had
was the Rush back-projection show: this was to come later, during the
'Moving Pictures' tour in 1981.<p>

  "We put everything hack into our road show" Peart told me because we
know how important it is to keep up the excitement of a live show. The
back projection is just another way of keeping up that excitement,
along with the lights and all that.<p>
 "We know there are some parts of our set which aren't quite as
musically active as others so the best thing to do there is to make
sure that attention is centered on stage.<p>
  "There's no question of the effects taking anything away from the
music - it's a question of highlighting, or illustrating it."<p>
