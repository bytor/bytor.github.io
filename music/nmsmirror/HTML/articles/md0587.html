<h2>"The Quest For New Drums"

<em>[ Taken from Modern Drummer -- May 1987 ]</em>
<p>
    Early in 1986, I started to think that it was time for a new drumkit.
My red Tamas had been through four or five serious tours, and had been used
in the recording of <u>Signals</u>, <u>Grace Under Pressure</u>, and <u>Power 
Windows</u>. They still sounded and looked great, but were getting a little 
tired, and besides, every four or five years I just like a change -- perhaps a
different sound and look.
<p>
    But how to choose? Well, I think people usually buy what they've been
satisfied with before, or they buy something that someone else sounds good
playing. That's okay, I suppose, but this time I wanted to make absolutely
sure that I was choosing the best-sounding drums available (or at least,
the best sounding to me).
<p>
    So I spoke to Neal Graham at the Percussion Center in Fort Wayne, and
we arranged to have no less than six identically sized kits with the same
heads brought together in the same room, so that I could do an objective
"road test" of each one. We tried to pick the most resonant shells from
each of the makers in which I was interested. There was a set of Tama
Artstars, a set of Premier Resonators, a set of Yamaha Tour series, the new
Ludwig Super Classics, a set of Sonors, and a set of Tempus fiberglass
drums from Canada -- what I felt would be the best drums from six countries
and three continents. (Although I would certainly have included Gretsch in
this category, I already have a small Gretsch practice kit at home, so I
know they probably sound a bit warmer than I was looking for -- plus the
company proved surprisingly uncooperative in regard to this test.)
<p>
    I enjoyed the long drive down to Forst Wayne from Toronto with my wife
Jackie, cruising through the heartland in spring. It was lovely winding
along the Maumee River in a good car, thinking thoughts of spring -- and of
having all those drums to play with.
<p>
    But before that, I had to survive the ordeal of my first serious drum
seminar(!). I had promised Neal Graham for years now that someday I would
do my first real clinic for him, though the idea of speaking in front of a
crowd seemed a lot more intimidating than just playing drums. But there
would never be a better opportunity than this, and sometimes I like to do
things that scare me! Fortunately, it went pretty well, and I felt good
about having "survived" the experience.
<p>
    The next day, we went out to Larry Yager's farmhouse, and I spent the
whole day tuning and comparing the different kits, trying to be as
objective and careful as I could. I took a walk outside once in a while to
give my ears a break, as darkening skies, strengthening winds, sporadic
raindrops, and weather warnings threatened my first tornado! I've always
wanted to see one...I think!
<p>
    But I do love to see nature in dramatic action like that, and it was
nice to walk outside and be whipped by the wind for a few minutes. Refreshed
and energized by these natural forces, I bravely returned indoors, and
tuned and compared some more.
<p>
    Playing the kits side by side, and sometimes two simultaneously, I was
trying to detect the subtle differences between them. Of course, all of
these are great-sounding drums; any difference I would find would have to
be so subtle that only the most careful evaluation could detect it. In
fact, I would have been happy to record or tour with any of these drums, but
I was looking for something special -- that extra bit of tonality and
"snap."
<p>
    While I was shopping for snap, Larry was shopping for hardware,
comparing the different "shiny bits" for durability, practicality, and good
design. We settled on mainly Premier stands, with a few bits and pieces
from Tama and Pearl.
<p>
    It was interesting that the 9x13 tom seemed to be the "acid test" for
tom sounds. In each of the kits, the 8x12 and 16x16 toms were "much of a
muchness," but there were subtle differences in that 9x13 that really told
the tale. It seems to be a critical size.
<p>
    I also checked out a few snare drums, and was particularly impressed by
the new Pearl model with the interchangeable shells. Nice idea! But I'm
afraid nothing has taken the place of the old Slingerland yet; it's still
number one.
<p>
    Another interesting discovery was that the Premier Resonators were
anything but resonant! We received permission from the company to remove
the inner shells, and then they sounded quite good -- rather comparable to
the Yamahas and Sonors in having a warm, very "controllable" sound. I'm
sure any of these would make very good studio drums, for getting a good
sound with a minimum of fuss.
<p>
    But I was looking for something a little edgier, a little more exciting
-- something that needed a careful tuning and playing approach to bring it
alive. And I found it, too, in the Ludwigs. The results were surprising, as
I must admit Ludwig had been a kind of "dark horse" contender to me. In
fact, it was a very near thing between them and the Tamas. I had to take
another walk outside, and then compare them again to be sure. (Disappoint- 
ingly, but perhaps fortunately after all, the tornado failed to appear!)
<p>
    But there is was: the response, the tonality -- the overall excitement
of the Ludwig sound was just fractionally better. So...I ordered a set!
<p>
    We were to start working on nw material in the fall, and I really
wanted to update my electronic outfit as well. I had been watching the
progress of digital sampling units for a couple of years, and felt that the
time was right to explore that. I spoke with the band's "technological
mentor," Jim Burgess, told him what I was after, and he recommended that
Akai unit, with a Yamaha MIDI controller. I decided to stay with the latest
Simmons pads, as I like the feel of them.
<p>
    The sounds are digitally stored on those little 3 1/2" computer disks,
and once you put them into the Akai's RAM memory, you can edit and change
them at will without affecting the original sample. Assigning them to
different pads is a simple affair, and you can copy from the RAM to a new
disk to create new setups and safety copies. With the Yamaha MIDI
controller, you can create "chains," which allow you to change programs
with the flick of a footswitch. For example, in one of the new songs on
which we're working as I write, I play an African drum setup for the
verses, and then "click" to a setup of my acoustic Tama drums, sampled from
"Grand Designs", for the choruses. Fantastic! I love it!
<p>
    I have mentioned before in MD's pages that I do not have a natural
empathy with technological things -- they often give me a headache -- but
at the same time I had to get into this, because, in the simplest terms, it
does what I want! I have an insatiable hunger for new percussion sounds,
but there is just no room in my existing setup for any more drums! This
way, I can have access to every percussion sound ever played (and some
beyond), and still be able to reach them all!
<p>
    I spent some time with Jim assembling a library of disks: all kinds of
ethnic percussion, acoustic drum samples from our <u>Power Windows</u> album
paint cans, big sheets of metal, industrial sounds, pipes being struck --
you name it! The possibilities are absolutely infinite.
<p>
    One more decision that had to be made was whether or not to have the
Vibrafibing applied to the inner shells. My last three kits had been
treated by the Percussion Center with this thin layer of fiberglass, which
is meant to even out the tonality. In keeping with my policy this time of
taking nothing for granted, I asked them to do a sample 9x13 Ludwig tom to
compare with an untreated one. Once again, it was a painstaking decision; I
even took them into "Le Studio" to listen to, since I was in Quebec at the
time. I found them to be a little sharper with the Vibrafibing, and the
tonality was a little more focused.
<p>
    Making a decision on the finish was equally difficult. As much as I
loved the Candy Apple Red finish of my Tamas, I just couldn't have the same
color again! Neal and I discussed a few possibilities, and he did me up a
sample with a mix consisting of an opalescent white base, with just a hint
of pink in it, and a few metallic flecks to highlight the opalescence.
(More goodies from the "hot rod" finishes book!) I stayed with the brass
plating on the hardware -- because I couldn't think of anything nicer!
<p>
    Another thing I have been seeking for quite a while is a keyboard
percussion synthesizer. I had been playing a marimba quite a lot and really
wanted some kind of more portable instrument to use live and (hopefully) in
the studio. Once again, Jim did some research and came up with a unit made
by the KAT company in Massachusetts.
<p>
    It is available in modules of one octave and up, and basically consists
of a set of soft rubber pads laid out as a keyboard. I decided on a three-
octave range, and since the KAT is also a programmable MIDI controller,
compatible with the Akai unit, I started collecting samples of marimbas,
vibes, tubular bells, glockenspiel, tuned African percussion, harp
arpeggios -- again, you name it!
<p>
    Like many percussionists, I had long harbored a secret wish to create a
piece of music using only percussion instruments, and this looked like the
key to that dream! I practiced with the KAT for a few days and then, when I
had a free day, recorded a "demo" of a marimba piece I had been working on
over the summer.
<p>
    I began with the marimba part, double-tracked it, and then overdubbed
my acoustic drums on top (yes, the new Ludwigs!). I began experimenting
with overdubbing different vibe sounds, a bass marimba, a cabasa,
castanets, concert toms, metal sheets, African toms, and some highly tuned
bongos. (All of this was played with mallets on the KAT unit.) I did use
one of Geddy's keyboard sounds, but since it consisted of a marimba with a
human voice mixed in, I decided that was close enough!
<p>
    The biggest difficulty was finding a good bass instrument in the
percussion library. The bass marimba didn't provide the power in the bottom
end that I was looking for, so we experimented with some other things. We
ended up using an African drum called a Djembe -- transposed to the
keyboard -- and I played the bass part with that! It made me laugh -- a new
definition of "bass drum"!
<p>
    The piece is entitled "Pieces Of Eight" because of all the different
time signatures it ended up meandering through. I hadn't thought about that
too much just playing the marimba, until I had to learn it on drums! With
only a day to record it all, I didn't really have time to play it more than
a couple of times through, so that, too, was a good challenge.
<p>
    I find it interesting as a drummer to work with a melodic instrument
and think melody as well as rhythm. You can really get into some wild
areas! In a way, I wish I hadn't been so obsessed with drums alone in the
beginning and had acquired more knowledge of music theory. But I suppose in
this day and age you do have to specialize!
<p>
    Now, if I only had about two weeks in the studio to work on this thing...
<p>
    So I've got my new drumkit. Am I happy now? Well, yeah! Here I've
managed to hang on to the best of both worlds: an exciting-sounding
acoustic set and an incredibly versatile and "user-friendly" electronic
set. Who could ask for more?
<p>
    Well, how about "Pieces Of Eight" becoming a hit single? Ha-ha!
