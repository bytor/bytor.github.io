<p>
Mardi Gras is a decent-enough sounding show, the band comes across very well.
However, occasionally you can hear something passing in front of the mics, as
if people are walking in front of the recorder. It leaves the overall concert
uneven in quality.<p>

This is very much an audience recording; talking, yelling, clapping and 
singing are all very prevelant throughout the concert (both during and 
inbetween the songs).  You can even hear someone telling others that he's 
recording the concert!<p>

The encore is left out on this cd, so this is not the complete show. Xanadu is
also left off the packaging, but does appear on the disc, and The Pass is
listed as The Task. This is done in a digi-pak (a cardboard jewel box) so it 
doesn't come with any type of booklet. It does have nice pictures on the 
front and back. The front one is from the Presto tour, the back is an 
awesome close-up of Alex in concert.<p>

Probably this is one disc you'll want to pass up, and get the full concert on
tape from a different source.<p>
