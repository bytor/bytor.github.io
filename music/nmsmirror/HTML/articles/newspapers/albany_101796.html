<font size=+1>POWER TRIO RUSH KICKS OFF TOUR IN ALBANY</font><br>
<b>by Greg Haymes</b><p>

Canadian power trio Rush doesn't hit the stage at the
Knickerbocker Arena until Saturday night, but you may
have already seen drummer Neil Peart, guitarist Alex
Lifeson and bassist Geddy Lee around town. <p>

You see, not only is Rush kicking off its latest tour at the
Knick, but the band has also been rehearsing there this
week, too. <p>

"We usually pick a different place to start off the tour
each time we go out on the road," Peart explained on the
telephone from Toronto, where Rush was winding up
some preliminary pre-tour rehearsals. <P>

"Of course, it needs to be a place where we can book
the arena for a week and a half or so. Last time out, we
went to Pensacola, I believe, but we've gone into places
like St. John's in Newfoundland, Hamilton in Ontario
and Greensboro in South Carolina one time. <P>

"It's nice because you get to stay in one place for a little
while and really see the area, instead of just flying in,
doing the show and flying back out again, which is
usually what it's like on tour." <P>

Plus, Rush gets Albany out of the way before the snow
flies, too. <P>

"Well, yes, that's part of the rationale, too, I must
admit," Peart concedes. "We call it creative routing." <P>

The snow plays a major factor, since the band had more
than their fair share back in January when they trudged
into Bearsville Studios just outside of Woodstock to
record their latest album, "Test For Echo." <P>

"It was simply unbelievable," the drummer declares.
"There we were right in the middle of the Blizzard of
'96. It socked us in on the very day that we arrived
there. <P>

"But we had no complaints, really. It was gorgeous. I
do love winter, and in its place, it's a fine time of the
year. So the Catskills was a particularly beautiful place
to be with all that snow coming down." <P>

It also forced them to focus on their music, and the
results are some of the strongest songs that the band has
crafted in more than a decade. <P>

"We feel that it's a particularly strong album," Peart
proclaims, "but of course, we learned long ago that it
doesn't necessarily mean that the echo will come back
the same way. <P>

"With this album, we're sending out a kind of signal,
and we're hoping that the `Hello' is going to come back
as strongly as we put it out, but you never know. Only
time will tell." <P>

After Rush ended its Counterparts tour in May of '94,
the band took a long hiatus. "It was the longest break
that we'd ever taken," Peart reveals, "but it was a very
fruitful time." <P>

During the break, Lee and his wife had a baby girl,
Lifeson produced his first-ever solo album (under the
name Victor) and Peart kept himself quite busy
producing a tribute album to big band drummer Buddy
Rich. <P>

He worried about being able to get back into the swing
of things with Rush when it came time to start work on
"Test For Echo." <P>

"Well, I did worry about it. I'd been away during the
intervening time doing so many different things that I
truly wondered -- especially from a lyric-writing point of
view -- whether I'd be able to sit down at the desk and
distill all of the thoughts and experiences into rock
lyrics. Once I got going, it was really no trouble. <P>

"Or at least no more trouble than usual, let me put it that
way. It's always initially a frustrating, disappointing
process for me. It always takes me three days or so to
get into a swing where I don't want to burn every piece
of paper that leaves my desk. <P>

"But that's normal, and it's as it should be. You have to
call up your discipline and refine the craft aspect of the
process. Fortunately, within a few days we started to
become happy with the results. <P>

During his long time off from Rush, Peart also explored
two very different activities -- drumming and writing. <P>

"I found Freddy Gruber, who is a 70-year-old master
teacher from California, to help me re-explore the whole
world of drumming. I've been working with him for
two years now, and I'll probably stay with him for the
rest of my life." <P>

So what can a drum teacher show someone like Peart,
who's been playing professionally for years? <P>

"Well, pro tennis players certainly know how to play
the game, but they all have coaches, don't they? Freddy
serves the same kind of purpose. He doesn't tell you
how to keep the beat or anything, but watches you play
and makes suggestions like sit further back or raise your
snare drum higher or make your motion more circular. <P>

"All of his advice added up to such a regeneration for
me on the drums that I literally started over. I hold the
sticks a different way and sit at the drums a whole
different way. He helped to rebuild my whole approach
to the drums, day by day, down in the basement. It was
a revelation." <P>

While drumming may have kept Peart sharp physically,
he turned to writing to keep his brain in shape. <P>

"I did a lot of prose writing, and I'm actually having my
first book published here in Canada this month," he
reveals. "It's called `The Masked Rider,' and it's a book
about bicycling in West Africa, basically recounting a
trip that I took through the country of Cameroon back in
'88 -- woven in with a lot of ranting and ranting, silly
little tangents and self-indulgences." <P>

But writing isn't new for Peart. <P>

"I've been pretty serious about prose writing for the
past 10 years, and I've explored everything from essays
to fiction. But I get the most enjoyment out of travel
writing. I love to travel for a start, but I also love the
documenting, the collecting of notes and gathering of
background information.<P>

"I've got lots of material. I just need the time to put it all
together. But I think I'd like to be able to finish about
one book a year. <P>

"Drumming is pretty much all-consuming, but prose
writing is a great thrill for me because I get to use the
other side of my brain. <P>

"It keeps me walking straight and balanced." <P>
