To see an open late night store<br>
Drove by  it once or twice<br>
I'll break my fast from Mt. Dew<br>
And drink the drink that tastes so nice<p>

I had heard the weekly sales<br>
Of Dew that had been seen<br>
The deepest can O' green<br>
From the parking lot, I spied a Dew<br>
I scanned the frozen bottle tops<br>
Of cola wars full-blown<br>
Bad ad hype outgrown<br>
Grabbing for the last Can O' Dew ,Can-O-Dew<p>

To stand inside the corner store<br>
Sustained by a drunk man<br>
To taste again the drink of mine<br>
The last ice cold can<br>
To find an open late night store<br>
To extend this life long vice<br>
Oh I will chug this Mt. Dew<br>
And drink the drink that tastes so nice (oh, so nice!)<p>

A thousand cans I've drank pre dawn<br>
But Dew still grabs my eye<br>
Dew still makes me high<br>
Praying for an ever flowing Dew<br>
Waiting for the can to end<br>
Stomach - reunite<br>
Buying for the night<br>
Paying for the last Can O Dew,  (Can-O-Dew)<br>
Gone inside the corner store<br>
Sustained by a drunk man<br>
"To serve my favorite patron<br>
O, the last ice cold can"<p>

Another buck I will upturn<br>
To buy a can so nice<br>
For I have drank my Mt. Dew<br>
And drink the drink that tastes so nice, (whoo  A real high price!)<p>
