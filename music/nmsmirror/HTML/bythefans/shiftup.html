  I turned my head<br>
  I spun my wheels<br>
  Landing on elbows<br>
  You know how that feels<p>

  I'm on a hawg now---<br>
  Or is it a 'glide?<br>
  Won't be too careful<br>
  With this fabulous ride<br>
  If I could only pass that car inside.<br>
  And burn it up<p>

  SHIFT UP---Or you can throttle back down<br>
  SHIFT UP---Miss the volvo<br>
  Or your butt'll hit the ground<br>
  SHIFT UP---There's still time to run<br>
  That car aground<br>
  SHIFT UP---Burn it up---<br>
  Or wear the road rash crown<br>
  Burn it up<p>

  Sudden rain,<br>
  Hydroplane<br>
  I don't think my motorbike<br>
  Will beat this train<p>

  I'm in a groove now<br>
  Or is it a ditch?<br>
  I want my teeth back<br>
  This crashing is a bitch<br>
  I get so hungry, when they wire my mouth shut<br>
  And burn it up<p>

  I got all broke up inside<br>
  But didn't earn the road rash throne<br>
  The leathers really saved my hide<br>
  but it's bad to be a bone<p>

  I can go out, I can take a ride<br>
  But only on my wheelchair<br>
  The leather sure saved my hide<br>
  And at least I still have hair<br>
  Burn it up<p>
