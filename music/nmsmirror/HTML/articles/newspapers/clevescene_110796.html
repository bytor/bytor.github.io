Canada's elite power trio arrived in town
Monday night to deliver over two-and-a-half hours of
seminal prog-rock that documented its entire 25-year
career. Billed as "An Entire Evening With Rush," the
concert was a spirited performance on the part of
bandmates Geddy Lee (bass and vocals), Alex
Lifeson (guitars) and drummer extraordinaire Neil
Peart. <p>

Global touring is hardly new to these arena
veterans (they're currently touring behind their 16th
studio album), but what distinguished this visit from
past shows was the lack of an opening band. Never
before has the trio been able to play 25-song sets --
the time constraints of sharing a bill with an opening act simply wouldn't 
permit it. But Rush were unhampered on this night
at the Gund, and ticket-buying fans rejoiced the fact. <p>

Surprisingly, Lee and company didn't start off with new material, but 
"Dreamline" saw the band bolting out of the
starting gate anyway. Lifeson's serrated guitar sound fueled the twists and 
turns of "Driven," giving the crowd its first
luscious taste of the new TEST FOR ECHO. <p>

The automotive theme continued. The band
revisited the classic "Red Barchetta" while a live
camera feed splayed its images on a huge video
screen behind Peart's rotating acoustic kit. The
black-clad Lifeson drew quick laughs by mugging
with cardboard cut-outs of Marilyn Monroe and the
Three Stooges while picking arpeggios and fierce
solos. "Animate" and "Nobody's Hero" were choice
selections from the 1993 album COUNTERPARTS. <p>

The progressive rock purists didn't reach
Xanadu until the threesome rendered the epic "2112"
in its entirety. Gradually the 1975 space opera
unfolded, telling the tale of a future-world hero who
discovers a guitar and learns the forbidden art of music. The band was 
understandably breathless after winding down with
the defiant "Temples Of Syrinx" coda, but a 20-minute intermission allowed 
overjoyed fans to make potty stops and beer runs. <P>

       The stage was slightly modified for the band's second set. Satellite 
dishes were unveiled on each side of the stage,
and tundra-esque snowscapes were projected onscreen. When Rush returned and 
lunged into "Test For Echo," the dishes pivoted to the churning rhythm and 
emitted green laser beams that pierced the darkness. The art of skillful 
lighting is usually lost on such big rock events, but the pod configurations 
and color schemes for this show were phenomenal -- surely amongst
the best to ever illuminate the Gund. <p>

       "Subdivisions" was the only cut from SIGNALS, and featured Lee on both 
bass and keyboards. Nobody really
cared that the set consisted primarily of guitar-based rock and roll. FM radio 
staple "Freewill" only underscored that point,
and Lifeson and Lee's guitar-bass jam in the middle of the song raised the 
intensity level considerably. These older songs
typically sounded better than more recent, unproven Rush cuts, and the crowd 
reaction to them was markedly louder. <p>

       After some instrumental foreplay with the funky "Leave That Thing 
Alone," Lifeson and Lee abdicated the stage to
the percussion prowess of Peart. The band's lyricist approached his solo as a 
musical composition unto itself, flailing away
on his snare and hammering out melodies on electronic xylophone pads. With his 
mathematical rhythms and meticulous stick
work, Peart demonstrated again that while drum solos in general do suck, his 
is one you don't want to miss. <p>

       More techno-rock mayhem from the '80s ensued with "Natural Science" and 
the bass-guided "Force 10." The only
predictable move Rush made all night was to wrap things up with the ageless 
hit "Spirit Of Radio" and the perennial favorite
"Tom Sawyer." <p>

       Encore instrumental "YYZ" reminded all in attendance of why they became 
Rush devotees in the first place -- the
individual members are brilliant, tight-playing musicians whose arrangements 
are always clever and exciting. The night's
only drawbacks were the sparse (but obvious) keyboard sequences piped into 
the mix for certain tunes, like the horns on
"Roll The Bones." You'd think a band of Rush's caliber wouldn't have to rely 
on cheap tricks.
