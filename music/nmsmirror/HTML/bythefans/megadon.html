                  "...And the meek shall inherit the earth..."<p>
 
                  At least that's what everyone's always said, since the
             beginning of time I'm told.  It's kind of difficult to
             believe now, though.  It's a long story that all started a
             few weeks back.<p>
 
                  Actually it started years ago, when the Priests took
             control under the Solar Federation.  The Priests hold their
             lofty position high in the mountains of Syrinx, which lie
             just north of Megadon, where I live.  Megadon is known as
             the center of the Federation, but Syrinx is where all the
             power lies.<p>
 
                  The Priests can provide us with all we want (which they
             essentially do), and get their own way at the same time.
             They're really powerful looking people, just by sight.  They
             always dress in these long, black robes -- almost religious
             looking but not quite.  They all have long beards, too.  I'm
             not sure why this is, but they've had them as long as I can
             remember, long black beards. Kind of a depressing sight, but
             definately awe-inspiring.  They hand everything out from
             their position in the Temples of Syrinx and expect to get
             loads of praise for it.  They usually do.<p>
 
                  The Temples of Syrinx hold everything the heart and
             mind desire, and more.  That's a statement you hear quite a
             bit in Megadon, and it's basically true.  It's all there --
             art, music, business, everything.  The Temples, though their
             main deal here is supposed to be government, contain all of
             the city's museums, concert halls, art exhibits...
             everything artistic just thrown into one building.<p>
 
                  I remember visiting the Temples with my wife Marcia
             about three months ago.  Entering the Temples of Syrinx is
             an experience that can never be forgotten.  The first thing
             that hits you when you walk in is the music.  A crashing
             beat assaults your ears as soon as you enter.  I guess
             that's probably the central part of all the Temple music.
             It's all got that strong beat, along with some high pitched
             sound; fast-moving and kind of drawn out at the same time.
             I can't really describe it too well -- it's something that
             has to be experienced to really understand.  It is really
             great music, though.<p>
 
                  Once you're inside, you notice just how huge these
             buildings are.  There are huge walls in the place, a sort of
             light grey in color.  There's basically one main hall in
             each of the three temples with passages branching off
             leading to the different arts. All the halls are kind of
             toned-down, if that makes any sense.  The only thing that
             hits you when you walk in in the music -- there's no
             outlandish decoration, no powerful lighting... just the
             music.<p>
 
                  At the end of the hall is a huge altar, colored black,
             which the Priests sit behind.  There's something of a
             raised section in the back there, so the Priests have to
             look down on anyone who comes in to see them.  It's no
             wonder that the people of Megadon are intimidated into
             praising the Priests.  I even praised the Priests.  I
             thought it was wonderful what they had done with the
             Federation.  At least I thought that up until the event two
             weeks ago.<p>

<font size=+2> II. DISCOVERY</font><p>
</center>
 
                  I remember the day well -- as well as any day that
             changes the course of a life.  It was about four o'clock,
             and I had had a tough day plugging into the machines at the
             numbers plant.  Actually, I suppose it wasn't that tough,
             but it was still work, anyway.  I was anxious to get home,
             sink into a comfortable chair, and watch some Templevision
             for a few hours.  Templevision wasn't flashy or anything
             like that, but it tended to relax me.  Black and white
             pictures passed across the screen in the living room with
             the Temple-type music going along with it.<p>
 
                  I told Mack, the plant supervisor, that I was leaving
             early, and headed out on Walking Route #3.  It was a nice
             walk home, since the route was so deserted at this hour.  I
             remember thinking to myself what a nice job the Priests had
             done with the artificial scenery -- trees, bushes... all
             sorts of landscape beauty.  All shades of green, colorful
             flowers, a real work of art.  I was thinking that it was
             almost as beautiful as some of the scenery in the Temples
             when something caught my eye.<p>
 
                  The light was shining off of something under an
             artificial bush by the side of WR3.  I couldn't think what
             could be breaking up the perfection of the Priests' work.  I
             went over, pulled the bush out of the way and saw it.  It
             was obviously not part of the scenery, but I reached out to
             touch it anyway.  Thwaannggg!  I jumped back about ten feet
             when the thing screamed out at me.  I'd never even imagined
             anything like this....  I picked it up, being careful so it
             wouldn't make another sound, and carried it home with me to
             look at there.<p>
 
                  "Marcia!"  I called my wife when I got home.  "Marcia,
             honey, come see what I've found!"  I probably never entered
             the house more excited than when I brought home the object.<p>
 
                  She answered me twice, using the same phrase: "What is
             it Steve?"  The first time she didn't see the device in my
             hands and sounded bored as usual.  Once she saw it, though,
             her tone changed entirely.  "What is it, Steve?!"<p>
 
                  I answered her second question.  "I'm not exactly
             sure."  Not sure at all, more likely.  We talked about the
             strange device for days.<p>
 
                  "Where do you think it came from, Steve?" Marcia would
             ask me.<p>
 
                  "I don't know... I'm pretty sure it's not from the
             Priests, though.  That's not really their style.  They've
             always been striaghtforward, not secretive like this."<p>
 
                  Marcia drove me crazy with all of her questions.  "What
             do you think it's for?"<p>
 
                  "I guess I'm not really sure.  It probably has
             something to do with the noise it makes.  I've got to figure
             it out."  I spent hours at a time studying the thing.
             Marcia had to have been getting fed up with me.  She'd ask
             me a question, I'd answer her quick and go back to studying
             it, or ignore her entirely.  I slowly bacame possessed with
             the thing.<p>
 
                  I studied it well.  Pretty oddly shaped -- kind of like
             a big figure eight with a flat board coming out of the top
             (kind of like a neck).  Wires are stretched across the
             length of the thing.  The wires vibrate when I touch them,
             and produce beautiful music.  That was key.  The music I got
             from this thing was better than any Temple music ever
             produced.  No crashing beat to accompany it.  I wasn't
             restricted to fast high-pitched melodies.  There were the
             high notes, of course, but I could produce low tones,
             feeling tones.  Emotion.  That was what came out of this
             thing, emotion.<p>
 
                  "Show it to the Priests, Steve.  Show it to them,
             they'll know what to do.  Make a trip to the Temples of
             Syrinx, and show it to the Priests."  Marcia wouldn't let me
             alone for ten minutes without bugging me with this.  I
             argued with her about it at first.  I just wasn't sure if it
             was right to bring it to them.  I know they rule Megadon and
             everything, but I wasn't sure if they could possibly know
             what to do, since I was convinced it wasn't theirs.  To get
             her to shut up, I finally agreed with her.  Maybe it wasn't
             the right thing to do, but at least it got her away from me.
             I think she knew I agreed just so I could be  alone with it
             again.  I guess she was right, though.<p>

<font size=+2> III. PRESENTATION</font><p>
</center>
 
                  As I got close to seeing the Priests, I started to work
             harder with the device.  My friend Jon and I worked on a
             presentation and song for the Priests night and day.  Simple
             idea, really.  Show it to the Priests, get lots of praise,
             and the Priests'll pass it on to the people of Megadon.  It
             would all work out great.<p>
 
                  After a while, I had a good enough song for the
             Priests. (What I didn't know at the time, though, was that
             it didn't matter).  I entered the cold, grey Temples of
             Syrinx quickly -- it was finally time.  The black robes, the
             black beards, the black altar, all greeted me readily.  As
             for me, my speech was more than rehearsed and ready.  "Most
             honored Priests of the Temples of Syrinx.  I realize that it
             is a bit unorthodox to come before you like this, but I have
             discovered an amazing wonder that I decided would prove
             quite interesting to you all."<p>
 
                  I know this probably sounds too formal, but for the
             Priests, it's just protocol.  With this, I started playing.
             The song sounded better than ever before, echoing through
             the halls of the Temples.  My voice wasn't even close to
             good enough to match the device, but I began to sing anyway.<p>
 
                  "Feel my music," I urged them, in song, "hear what it
             has to say.  It's life, it's love, it's feeling.  Feel my
             music."<p>
 
                  My hand slipped on the neck of the device when I heard
             the Priests' reaction.  They conferred for a moment, and the
             rightmost beard began to twitch, then he spoke.  "We already
             know of your ancient wonder," he told me, sneer in his
             voice, "and we have no need for it.  Megadon is doing
             perfectly well without the ways of the ancient world.  That
             device is nothing but a throwback to times when the people
             were helpless, slowly destroying their world."<p>
 
                  I can't believe -- it's not possible!  I didn't stop
             playing, as much as I may have wanted to, I believed in what
             I held.  I only continued, with more energy than before.
             Maybe they didn't hear me, maybe they didn't understand me.<p>
 
                  "Listen....  You must be able to hear, to understand,
             to feel what this has the ability to do.  This is more than
             music, this is more than even you."<p>
 
                  Maybe that last statement was too much, but I really
             beleived in everything I said.  I was convinced that this
             music would be able to reach them.  It never did reach them.
             "We have no use for an instrument of people from old times
             and old ways," the one beard grumbled, anger building in his
             voice, "Now begone, brother, and leave us to our work.  Your
             silly whim is of no use for the greater good."<p>
 
                  Silly whim.  They actually called this beauty a silly
             whim. As if this wasn't bad enough, they turned up the music
             in the Temples to overpower my own playing.  The rumbling
             beat rolled over my playing, crushing it soundly.  It was no
             use.  The fast wailing lines cut through my  feeling music
             too easily.  I finally dropped my hands and let the device
             dangle from a strap on my shoulder. I walked back out into
             the grey halls and sat on a grey bench, looking up at the
             tall grey ceiling.  It was late at night when they finally
             had to kick me out of the Temples.  I wandered home through
             the quiet night streets and fell into my bed.<p>

<font size=+2> IV. ORACLE : THE DREAM</font><p>
</center>
 
                  Too many questions were unanswered.  Isn't there more
             to life than just the Temples?  Was the power of this thing
             just in my head?  I couldn't believe that I had found this
             thing just to be shot down so quickly.  I always believed in
             a higher purpose --something that controlled fate, things
             like my stumbling out on WR3 that night.<p>
 
                  I knew this thing had possessed me, but I just didn't
             care anymore.  I looked out my window at the night sky, and
             I saw nothing but grey.  The twin moons did nothing to light
             up the grey sky, or the grey buildings of Megadon.  The city
             almost blends into the sky, leaving nothing to stand out, no
             single beacon, no guiding light.<p>
 
                  Was all this left up to me?  I slowly fell into a deep
             sleep, and left it to my dreams to answer my questions....<p>
 
                  I stand at the top of a spiral staircase, looking down
             into a deep abyss.  It's grey all around me, but nothing
             solid -- no ground, no sky, just grey with the blackness of
             the abyss below. An oracle meets me at the top of the stairs
             -- someone to guide me through the world of my  dreams.
             Kind of stupid to have something like this, I think, but I
             follow the oracle away.<p>
 
                  He leads me on away from my house, away from Megadon,
             away from the Temples of Syrinx.  We travel for days, past
             the Outer Planets with their atmospheric domes, past places
             I've never even seen.<p>
 
                  I see works of art better than anything ever seen in
             the Temples.  Maybe it's just that they're not confined in
             the cold grey walls, but they produce feelings, too, like
             the device.  There are paintings of the land around me,
             sculptures capturing life almost better than life itself,
             music better than any music ever created.  It's true -- the
             device is true.<p>
 
                  I also see people.  People with enthusiasm, and open
             minds. Their eyes are open to see all the beauty around
             them, to create the beauty around them.  They all have
             creative eyes, the ability to compose.<p>
 
                  The oracle explains what I'm seeing.  I don't see him
             speak, but I feel his words, his thoughts.  These people are
             the same people who the Priests called "helpless."  They are
             the Elder race. Long ago, they left Megadon, hoping to find
             more beauty.  They hoped to learn more, to see more, to be
             more.  Something which the Priests have prevented every
             Megadonian from achieving.  Every day, this race grows
             stronger, building power to return and claim their home
             where they belong.)<p>
 
 
<center>
<font size=+2> V. SOLILOQUY</font><p>
</center>
 
                  This dream was two days ago.  Since then I've been even
             more obsessed -- with the device and with the dream.  I
             haven't been to work.  Marcia has left me.  I've become so
             isolated that I'm not even sure when she left, or why.  I'm
             not sure that I care anymore. The dream occupies all my
             thoughts, day and night.<p>
 
                  I pray constantly that this dream was different from
             all my other dreams.  Dreams usually fade away, but this one
             just can't. This dream is the only thing that can save
             Megadon.<p>
 
                  But I begin to wonder if Megadon needs to be saved.
             I've lived with the Priests for so long....  Maybe it is the
             best way. They provide everything for us.  Nothing needs to
             be worked for. There's no point in work....<p>
 
                  But where is the ability to create?  I can't be the
             only one who beleives in creative powers -- the power of the
             device.  The Priests have taken all that away from us.  They
             provide us with the art and culture that they want, their
             creativity -- squeezing any remaining bit of originality out
             of us.  This can't be the way that it was meant to be.<p>
 
                  But the Temples contain all the art that anyone could
             want. They're open to all Megadonians.  Besides, there's the
             Temple Paper and Templevision for home culture and art.
             Maybe it's better leaving control of these things to the
             Priests.  Things like these can get out of control, too much
             creativity might be bad.  One man's creativity is another
             man's hatred.  Art can be offensive to some and  pleasing to
             others.  It can all get out of hand, but not if it's in the
             proper hands.<p>
 
                  But whose hands are proper?  It can't be the Priests.
             Art is meant to stay with the people.  The Elder race must
             have the answer.  Keep the art with the people.  The Priests
             are wrong.  But what can I do about it?  Does one man have
             the power to lead a revolution though music?<p>
 
                  I think of the dream again, the abyss.  The Elder race
             must return it's the only answer.  The Priests are wrong,
             but I don't have the power to right that wrong.  I stand at
             the edge of the abyss, looking downward to the depths of
             despair....<p>

<font size=+2> VI. GRAND FINALE</font><p>
</center>
 
                  Finally, it is happening.  A flash of light, the sound
             of a cannon.  A little push to start the chain reaction.
             Just a match to light the fuse.  It's here.  A new start?  A
             new beginning?<p>
 
                  I can't tell what's happening from my home, but I can't
             leave, not now.  Lights flash in through my window, but I
             can't see where they're coming from.  There's a noise, a
             crashing beat.  It must be battle.  The dream must be coming
             true -- but who will win?<p>
 
                  There's more and more sound coming from outside.  My
             house shakes with a powerful force.  The crashing beat
             continues. The light from the Twin Moons is dimmed by smoke
             -- I can see that much.  Maybe the new moons are over --
             maybe destruction of Megadon is here.  Who will win?<p>
 
                  It must be the Elder race, it has to be.  Here to tear
             the Temples down, here to change the life of every person in
             the Solar Federation.  The lights flash more quickly now,
             the smoke builds up outside.  I can hardly see the Twin
             Moons anymore.  The battle must be fierce -- two even
             forces?  Who will win?<p>
