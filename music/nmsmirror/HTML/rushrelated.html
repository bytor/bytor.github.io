"Gonna Roll The Bones"</strong></a> by Fritz Leiber </font><br>
<dd>
I believe this short story was originally published in the '50s. It gave
inspiration to the title "Roll The Bones" (Neil even makes a reference to it
in an interview, saying he has scraps of paper with phrases on them, and one
of them was "roll the bones"). <em>Note: This is a LONG short story!</em>

"Kubla Khan"</strong></a> by Samuel Taylor Coleridge </font><br>
<dd>
This poem was originally written in 1798 (published in 1816), while the poet 
was in opium-induced hallucination.  The poem remains unfinished, as before 
Coleridge could complete it, someone knocked on his door. By the time he had 
finished with the intruder, the inspiration had gone. "Kubla Khan" is the 
basis for the song "Xanadu".
