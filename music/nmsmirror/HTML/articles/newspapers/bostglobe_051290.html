<font size=+1>Rush's playful concert nods to the past</font><br>
<b>by Paul Robicheau</b><p>

WORCESTER -- You can count on certain things at a Rush concert, like
chock-a-block arrangements and a fancy light show. Sometimes, in fact, the
ambitious Canadian power trio's cool, busy delivery cruises into a
self-indulgent blur. You wish they would have rehearsed a month instead of the
craft-crazy six weeks they spent to get their current live set down as a synth
'n' pedal-juggling three-piece, just to loosen up.<p>

But alas, there is also a sense of humor behind those chops, and a shot of
spontaneity between the grooves, as Rush keenly demonstrated at the Centrum
Thursday night for 12,500 fans.<p>

After a solid but autopilot-minded first half that mixed recent hits ("Time
Stand Still," "Show Don't Tell") and old gems ("Free Will", "Red Barchetta"),
Rush literally pulled a rabbit out of a hat to bring its two-hour show to a
peak. Make that two rabbits. In keeping with the cover of the band's new album
"Presto," two inflatable bunnies grew out of tophats on stage, and when they
wiggled and rocked tot he warhorse hit "Tom Sawyer," the spoof on arena-rock
excess was hilarious.<p>

But musically, apart from playful jamming on "Closer to the Heart" and the
finale "In the Mood" (a nod to the band's Toronto bar scene roots), this Rush
was honed for serious execution. In addition to playing old instrumental
showpieces, "YYZ" and "La Villa Strangiato," Rush also dug out ancient fantasy
numbers like "2112" and "Xanadu." The latter's mythological lyrics were a far
cry from the preceding "Manhattan Project," with its atom bomb history lesson.
But those old songs from Rush's hard art-rock period also gave added punch and
dexterity to drummer Neil Peart's clean octopus-like fills, plus a few crying
solos by guitarist Alex Lifeson, who often gets lost in the group's
orchestration.<p>

But even with the nod back to art-rock, Rush didn't speak to its fans with
virtuoso twists alone. New songs "The Pass" and "War Paint," like
"Subdivisions," addressed the peer alienation that faces the suburban males
who are a share of the band's following. "The mirror always lies," bassist
Geddy Lee sang on "War Paint" as a backing film showed a girl and boy in
different guises to underline the folly of vanity.<p>

Opener Mr. Big sunk in the folly of vanity, and even moster bassist Billy
Sheehan couldn't save face. The title to the song "Addicted to That Rush" was
just a funny coincidence. This band lacked Rush's smarts.<p>
