<em>August 28, 1997</em>
<p>

Fibbin' up and down in circles<br>
Skidding down a road of white lies<br>
Staring in and out Ford Broncos<br>
Fibbin' to a fool's paradise<p>

IT'S MY TURN TO JIVE<br>
BUT IT'S MY TURN TO JIVE<p>

Fibbin' to a Goldman pallbearer<br>
Fibbin' to the edge of cajole<br>
Fibbin' on MacNeil-Lehrer<br>
Fibbin' to the judge 'bout a deep, dark hole<br>
(Putt!ing!golf!balls!in!the!dark!)<p>

Fibbin' day and night in circles<br>
Slicing like a whirlwind that cleaves<br>
Stealing in and out back alleys<br>
Fibbin' to a lawyer den of thieves<p>

BUT IT'S MY TURN TO JIVE<p>

Fibbin' in -- Fibbin' to the edge<br>
Fibbin' out -- Near the thin end of the hedge<br>
Fibbin' off - With gloves I've never seen<br>
Fibbin' on -- By the road to somewhere I've never been (Mexico)<p>

IT'S MY TURN TO JIVE<br>
BUT IT'S MY TURN TO JIVE<p>

The dough unwinds before me<br>
What was there is gone<br>
Take off my Bruno Maglis<br>
And I go riding on<p>
