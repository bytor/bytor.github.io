<font size=+1>Cranked-up Rush doesn't let fans down at United Center</font><br>
<b>by Greg Kot</b><p>

     Teenagers in the 1970's had a choice:  Blast Rush on the eight-track
while kicking back in the school parking lot, or cinch up the leather jacket
& silently wish that Rush's helium-voiced Geddy Lee would choke on a high
note.<p>
     The ultimate rite-of-passage band, Rush remains a primarily
testosterone-laden enterprise.  At the sold-out United Center on Monday, the
Canadian trio's audience was, at least 75% male, & most of them appeared to
know every lyric & anticipated every chord change with the accuracy of
lifetime obsessives.<p>
     Even though it flies well below the radar of mainstream record
business, Rush has endured & even flourished.  Despite only one Top-40 hit,
the Canadian trio has released 20 albums in 25 years & routinely sells out
arenas whenever it tours.  Like the Grateful Dead, Rush is among the biggest
cult bands in the world-reviled, misunderstood or dismissed by the
uninitiated, but virtually the only band that matters within its tight
circle of worshipers.<p>
     Rush revels in its normalcy, its utter lack of fashionability, & in its
distaste for love songs.  Singer-bassist Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson, &
drummer Neil Peart instead indulge instrumental flash & pseudo-philosophical
lyricism-the coolly cerebral music & message in perfect sync.<p>
     Though revered as a technician, Peart doesn't really swing & he sure
isn't funky.  But that matters little.  The bands' best-known compositions,
such as the epic "2112," performed Monday in its 20-minute plus entirety,
are like roller coaster, in which tempos shift constantly.  At this game,
Peart has few peers.  His four-limbed polyrhythms give the illusion of
racing thru an obstacle course at breakneck-speed, barely eluding a crash
with each sudden shift in direction.<p>
     With the aid of electronic pads on which he was able to pound out some
melody lines, the drummer actually turned his solo into something more that
a '70's cliche.  Not so much an improvisation as a composition, the Peart
solo demonstrated a sense of groove missing from the rest of the show; for a
brief moment it seemed there would be dancing at a Rush concert.<p>
     But before anything so rash occurred, Lifeson & Lee returned to the
stage & they burrowed into the labyrinthine twists & turns of "Natural
Science," another rarely performed cut resurrected for this performance-a 3
hour career retrospective balancing crowd pleasers such as "Tom Sawyer,"
"The Trees" and "The Big Money" with a healthy dose of the most recent
album, "Test for Echo."<p>
     On newer material such as "Virtuality" and "Driven," Rush epitomized
power-trio hard rock while demonstrating a feel for more nuanced textures.
 Although the group's songwriting has always been problematic, with slight
melodies propped up by complex arrangements, Rush has lately been paring
away some of the filigree & synth overkill in favor of a more direct,
guitar-driven approach.<p>
     Most notably, Lee's once infernally high voice has lowered an octave or
two, & it sounds warmer & more natural than before.  A handful of vintage
tunes such as "Closer to the Heart" still require him  to sing as though
he's being stabbed with a fork, an affectation that apparently continues to
bring pleasure to great numbers of Rush fans judging by the number of
lighters that illuminated the arena.  For some people, the eight-track in
the school parking lot is still cranked.
