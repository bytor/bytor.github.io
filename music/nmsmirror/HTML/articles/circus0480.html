Battered by old & new waves, Rush keeps their boat afloat by
rocking it

<em>
The disc jockey at CHOM-FM, Montreal, is winding up a radio
interview with Geddy Lee, singer and bass guitarist of Rush. Plowing
desperately through a pile of Rush albums on the studio floor while
the last record fades out, he finally looks up at Lee with a nervous
smile. "Let's go out with a hit. "<p>

"A hit?" Lee looks genuinely puzzled. "We don't have any hits."</em><p>

Fourteen thousand screaming Canucks packed right up to the concrete rafters
of the Montreal Forum don't agree. Nor do the 6,000-plus frostbitten fans
filing into the Palace Theatre from A1bany, New York's sub-freezing cold for
two nights running. As far as they are concerned, Rush -- the Canadian power
trio with ten years, a handful of U.S. gold records, and next to no radio
airplay behind them -- have nine albums' worth of hits. including the six
mini-epics on their most recent LP Permanent Waves (Mercury).<p>

Rush fans, a rabid breed, have their own ways of breaking hits. In
Montreal, a CHOM promotion director remarks that last December a
representative from Rush's Canadian record distributor, Capitol,
dropped off an advance tape of a track called "The Spirit of
Radio" from the new album. The station's request lines were jammed for days
by kids calling for the song, despite the fact that the Capitol rep took the
tape back after only one play on the air.<p>

But if Geddy Lee, blond cherubic guitarist Alex Lifeson, and lanky
affable drummer/lyricist Neil Peart (now minus his handlebar
mustache) dismiss the idea of a Rush radio hit as an improbable if
not impossible dream, just how do they gauge their success? In
record industry terms, it's a horde of multi-platinum, serious
critical examination in all the right papers, and a place in rock's
social register. For Rush, success seems to be the opportunity to
cries-cross the country by bus, play nearly 150 concerts a year, and
record ten-to-twenty minute songs full of tortuous rhythm changes,
bombastic riffing, and lyrical excursions into philosophy and
mythology without fear of interruption by management or record company. 
As one label exec told Geddy backstage in Albany, "you don't have to worry 
about anything. Your career has a life of its own."<p>

"I think we achieved success a long time ago," asserts Lee, a
soft-spoken expectant father of 26 with thick brown hair that hangs
like a deep pile carpet down his back. "The fact that we can go out
and tour for eight months and do exactly what we want to do and make
the kind of records exactly the way we want to make them, that's my
personal idea of success. And at the same time, we've each got our
own homes [Lee's is in a suburb of Toronto, while the others -- Alex
with his wife and two sons, Neil with his girlfriend and his young
daughter -- live out in the surrounding countryside]. We've got
cars. Nobody's starving and we're real comfortable."<p>

Neil Peart, an articulate speaker and avid reader (he divided his
time between an auto magazine and a Thomas Hardy novel in Albany),
concurs. "I think independence is the key in our terms. Once we'd
achieved concert success so we could choose to headline in certain
places and tour as long as we wanted to, then for us we're set.
Everything we wanted to do in life, we're able to do."<p>

Permanent Waves overflows with that kind of self-confidence. A
nearperfect marriage of heavy-metal rage and arty Britrock maneuvers
directly descended from Yes and Genesis, the album not only finds
guitarist Lifeson finally stepping out confidently from Jimmy Page's
shadow and Lee sanding off some of the more intensively rough edges
of his high rooster's crow, but it is Rush's most accessible
offering to date without revealing the slightest hint of compromise.
Unfazed by charges that they're holding the old line while the new
wave rolls over rock, the band found a suitable irony in the album
title Permanent Waves. "As far as I can see," offers Lee, "new wave,
old wave, yellow wave -- it's all the same. The water doesn't come
and go. The waves do."<p>

Appropriate logic, but when Toronto high school buddies Lee,
Lifeson, and original drummer John Rutsey formed Rush in the Year of
our Zeppelin 1969, few Canadian music moguls were buying. Lee
remembers being fired from one local club gig because the band was
playing so loud barmaids couldn't hear the beer orders. Cream, Jeff
Beck, and other seminal British heavy metallurgists were making big
FM noise, but it would be another five years before Rush could get
their first album out and even then it was on their own Moon label
because managers Ray Danniels and Vic Wilson had been turned down by
every Canadian record company at least twice.<p>

Things got only a little easier once Mercury released the Rush LP in
America. Alex Lifeson -- a classical guitar aficionado who sheepishly
admits he refused to take lessons when he was younger "because I
thought it was all 'Mary-had-a-little-lamb' stuff' -- remembers being
roundly booed offstage only once. "That was in Baltimore about five
years ago. We played a show with Sha-Na-Na. It was like a greaseball
dressup masquerade dance and it bordered on horribleness. They
didn't like us at all."<p>

But neither did radio programmers and the FM prejudice against Rush
(implied in the song "The Spirit of Radio" -- "For the words of the
profits/Are written on the studio walls") has only started to
subside with Permanent Waves. Lee confesses that "at one point, it
was what we played. Here was this band playing real raw stuff with a
singer that had a real bizarre voice and were playing seven, eight,
sometimes twenty minute tunes. I don't think we fitted into their
plans."<p>

Conversely, radio doesn't play a big part in Rush's plans. Ray
Danniels admits he's been confronting his charges with the idea of a
hit single for the eleven years he's been managing them. "They're no
longer afraid of it," he says "but they don't go out of their way to
make them either."<p>

"For us," insists Peart, "it's the audience, which is promotion on a
one-to-one basis. And that's a predominant policy in every area of
how we run the band. Programs, album covers, T-shirts -- it's all done
with the assumption that we are fans. What would we like to see if
we were going to a show?"<p>

They'd probably like to see a near-two-hour performance featuring
most of the new album, some of the earlier Zeppelinized numbers like
"Working Man," and complete sagas like "2112" and both parts of the
"Cygnus X-1" epic. That's not to mention a backdrop
film to go with "Cygnus," the occasional flashpot, and musicianship tight
enough to round up some heavy blues, a jazz break, a lyrical guitar passage,
and a mighty metallic climax in one tenminute instrumental. And that's
exactly what their fans get every night, for which Rush expect at least a
little critical respect if not love and kisses. "But the difference," notes
Peart, "is taking our work seriously, but not taking ourselves seriously."<p>

The band certainly doesn't sit around between shows with furrowed
brows, pondering the fate of the universe and how to put it to
music. Whenever possible, after each show, Rush and their road crew
head for a nearby ice hockey rink for a late-night game with real
sticks (contributed by some friends on the Montreal Canadiens team),
real uniforms, and real body checking. In warmer climes, they're
fond of the miniauto race tracks in amusement parks. Even on stage,
they're not above a good laugh. In the middle of "Natural Science," Geddy 
Lee actually plays the synthesizer with his ass -- sitting on the keyboard 
to create a thunderclap sound -- since his hands are too busy playing the 
bass. "We're not so serious that there can't be some humor in it, but" Lee 
reminds, "we're not comedians. "<p>

Staunch isolationists in a business that thrives on the greasing of
palms, Rush feel, as Peart explains, "there's enough justification
in just doing it for ourselves and for the great number of people
that relate to it." That includes Neil Peart's pet birds, who he
claims sing along to "Xanadu" on the Farewell to Kings album. Geddy
Lee, unfortunately, doesn't command as much respect in his house.<p>

"My cats hate our music. They leave the room as soon as I put on one
of our records. One of my cats, Max, if I put Kings on, he sits
there until 'Cygnus' comes on. Then he splits."<p>
