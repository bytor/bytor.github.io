<br><br>
<dd><em>How do you feel about Hemispheres?</em><p>

<strong>Hugh Syme (1983 interview): </strong>"Not as well as I feel about 
most of them."<p>

"The band told me, "Go ahead, we'll see it when we get back," because they 
were In Wales for the whole album and all my conversations with them were over
the telephone.  They didn't see it until it got out.  Technically, it's an 
abomination.<p>

"Once again, it's an effort in the progressive area of punning.  They talk
about Apollo and Dionysius in the lyrics, so I figured that Apollo would be
the severe, Magritte business man, and that Dionysius would, again, be the
reinstitution of a figure."</dd>

<strong><font size=+1>Have you ever written as you recorded?</font>
</strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Geddy Lee (Guitar Player magazine, April 1986): </strong>"Yeah.  
Hemispheres was done that way.  It was a lot of pressure and a lot
of strain on the brain.  And it took us a long time to achieve what we wanted.
In the end, we had a certain confidence that we'd never really be stuck.
It's good to do that, I think.  It's like on-the-spot training.  "Okay,
we need one more song.  Let's write it."  You can do it.  You know you can
reach back and put something together, but the more time you have to live
with the material, the better record you can make."</dd>

<strong><font size=+1>How did the lyrics to Hemispheres come about?</font>
</strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>From "Success Under Pressure": </strong>Neil Peart came up with the 
lyrics for the "Hemispheres" piece after
reading the book <STRONG>Powers Of Mind</STRONG>. He wrote about the 
division of the brain into hemispheres, with the characters Dionysis and 
Apollo controlling the left and right sides, respectively. Cygnus arrived 
on the scene as the bringer of balance.</dd>

Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres  I. Prelude
------ --- ---- --  -----------  -  -------
When our weary world was young
The struggle of the ancients first began.
The gods of Love and Reason
Sought alone to rule the fate of Man.

They battled through the ages,
But still neither force would yield.
The people were divided,
Every soul a battlefield.

II. Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom
--  ------  ------- -- ------
"I bring truth and understanding,
I bring wit and wisdom fair,
Precious gifts beyond compare.
We can build a world of wonder,
I can make you all aware.
I will find you food and shelter,
Show you fire to keep you warm
Through the endless winter storm.
You can live in grace and comfort
In the world that you transform."

The people were delighted
Coming forth to claim their prize
They ran to build their cities
And converse among the wise.
But one day the streets fell silent,
Yet they knew not what was wrong.
The urge to build these fine things
Seemed not to be so strong.
The wise men were consulted,
And the Bridge of Death was crossed
In quest of Dionysus,
To find out what they had lost.

III. Dionysus: Bringer of Love
---  --------  ------- -- ----
"I bring love to give you solace
In the darkness of the night,
In the Heart's eternal light.
You need only trust your feelings;
Only love can steer you right.
I bring laughter, I bring music,
I bring joy and I bring tears.
I will soothe your primal fears.
Throw off those chains of reason
And your prison disappears."

The cities were abandoned,
And the forests echoed song.
They danced and lived as brothers;
They knew love could not be wrong.
Food and wine they had aplenty
And they slept beneath the stars.
The people were contented
And the Gods watched from afar.
But the winter fell upon them
And it caught them unprepared,
Bringing wolves and cold starvation,
And the hearts of men despaired.

IV. Armageddon: The Battle of Heart and Mind
--  ----------  --- ------ -- ----- --- ----
The Universe divided
As the Heart and Mind collided,
With the people left unguided
For so many troubled years.
In a cloud of doubts and fears,
Their world was torn asunder into hollow Hemispheres.

Some fought themselves, some fought each other.
Most just followed one another,
Lost and aimless like their brothers,
For their hearts were so unclear,
And the truth could not appear.
Their spirits were divided into blinded Hemispheres.

Some who did not fight
Brought tales of old to light.
My Rocinante' sailed by night
On her final flight.
To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force
We set our course.
Spiralled through that timeless space
To this immortal place.


V. Cygnus: Bringer of Balance
-  ------  ------- -- -------
I have memory and awareness,
But I have no shape or form.
As a disembodied spirit,
I am dead and yet unborn.
I have passed into Olympus
As was told in tales of old,
To the city of Immortals,
Marble white and purest gold.

I see the gods in battle rage on high,
Thunderbolts across the sky.
I cannot move, I cannot hide,
I feel a silent scream begin inside.

Then all at once the chaos ceased.
A stillness fell, a sudden peace.
The warriors felt my silent cry
And stayed their struggle, mystified.

Apollo was atonished;
Dionysus thought me mad.
But they heard my story further,
And they wondered, and were sad.

Looking down from Olympus
On a world of doubt and fear,
Its surface splintered
Into sorry Hemispheres.

They sat a while in silence,
Then they turned at last to me.
"We will call you Cygnus,
The god of Balance you shall be."

The Sphere: A Kind of Dream
--- ------  - ---- -- -----
We can walk our road together
If our goals are all the same.
We can run alone and free
If we pursue a different aim.
Let the truth of love be lighted,
Let the love of truth shine clear.
Sensibility, armed with sense and liberty,
With the Heart and Mind united in a single perfect Sphere.

<font size=+1><strong>What do the French lyrics in "Circumstances" 
mean?</font></strong><br><br>

<dd><strong>From the Rush FAQ: </strong>"The more that things change, the 
more they stay the same."</dd>

Circumstances
-------------
A boy alone, so far from home,
Endless rooftops from my window.
I felt the gloom of empty rooms
On rainy afternoons.
Sometimes, in confusion,
I felt so lost and disillusioned,
Innocence gave me confidence
To go up against reality.

All the same, we take our chances,
Laughed at by Time,
Tricked by Circumstances.
Plus ca change,
Plus c'est la meme chose,
The more that things change,
The more they stay the same.

Now I've gained some understanding
Of the only world that we see.
Things that I once dreamed of
Have become reality.
These walls that still surround me
Still contain the same old me,
Just one more who's searching for a world that ought to be.

<font size=+1><strong>Is there a message in "The Trees"?</font></strong><br><br>

<dd><strong>Neil Peart (Modern Drummer, April/May 1980): </strong>"No. It was 
just a flash. I was working on an entirely different thing
when I saw a cartoon picture of these trees carrying on like fools. I
thought, "What if trees acted like people?" So I saw it as a cartoon
really, and wrote it that way. I think that's the image that it conjures
up to a listener or a reader. A very simple statement." </dd>

The Trees
--- -----
There is unrest in the forest,
There is trouble with the trees,
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas.

The trouble with the maples,
(And they're quite convinced the're right)
They say the oaks are just too lofty
And they grab up all the light.
But the oaks can't help their feelings
If they like the way they're made.
And they wonder why the maples
Can't be happy in their shade.

There is trouble in the forest,
And the creatures all have fled,
As the maples scream `Oppression`
And the oaks, just shake their heads

So the maples formed a union
And demanded equal rights.
"The oaks are just too greedy;
We will make them give us light."
Now there's no more oak oppression,
For they passed a noble law,
And the trees are all kept equal
By hatchet, axe, and saw.

<font size=+1><strong>Alex on playing the solo in concert:</font></strong><br><br>
<dd><strong>Alex Lifeson (Guitar magazine, 1984): </strong>"I always enjoy 
playing that solo.  I like the changes and it's a 
very emotive bluesy kind of solo.  It too stays basically the same 
every night.  The band is in the background modulating between two 
notes and it gives me a chance to wail."</dd> <P>

<font size=+1><strong>What does "La Villa Strangiato" mean?</font></strong>
<br><br>
<dd><strong>From "Visions": </strong>"Weird City" is a rough translation 
of the title.<p>

<strong>Atthe Tossavainen (d37690r@kaira.hut.fi): </strong>"La villa, be 
it Spanish or Italian, doesn't mean a village or a city, but rather a HOUSE. 
Strangiato is probably just pidgin Spanish, a made-up word."</dd>

<P>
<strong>jdinkins@polyslo.alpoly.edu: </strong>The song itself is based on 
several of Alex's nightmares and some cartoon
themes.  Much of this music can be heard on a CD called The Carl Stalling
Project - "Music From Warner Bros. Cartoons 1936-1958."  Warner Bros. -
26027-2 (approximately 77 minutes on CD). These are the original soundtracks
from Loony Tunes/Merrie Melodies, mostly in the '40s and '50s. 
<P>

<strong>Frank Schaapherder (schaaphe@serc.nl): </strong>
The first part of "La Villa Strangiato," "Buenos Nochas, Mein Froinds!,"
is based on the German song "Gute Nacht, Freunde," written by
A. Yondrascheck.  I noted the resemblance between the two songs
immediately when I first heard "La Villa." The notes until the fast
part are almost identical. Also note the similarities in the titles - 
they have the same meaning, and the reference to German in Rush's
title (Mein Froinds).</dd>

Thanks, Brad!<P>
<strong>Note:</strong>
 Danforth and Pape is an intersection in Toronto. Actually, it's Danforth
Ave. and Pape St. This is a heavily Greek section of Toronto, and even the
street names are written in English and Greek. The actual intersection has
a donut place (there are LOTS in Canada) like two banks and a random store.
