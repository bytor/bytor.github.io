    <font size=+2>T</font>he first time I saw Rush - the first l time I actually met them -
 was Sunday, February 12,1978. That was the opening date of their
 second British tour. They were set to do 16 dates in all, kicking off
 at Birmingham Odeon.<p>

    At the time I was a press officer with Phonogram Records, who
released Rush's records in this country on the Mercury label.<p>

    I travelled to Birmingham with two other Phonogram employees -
artist liaison man John Burnham and product manager Alan Phillips. On
the way we speculated on how well the band would do. Their 'Farewell
To Kings' album had been released at the end of the previous year and
had been selling well. In addition they had a staunch supporter in
the shape of Geoff Barton who had given the band immense exposure in
Sounds. On the other hand, though, the boom in hard rock, heavy metal,
symphonic rock, pomp-rock - call it what you will - had not yet
developed to the extent it would in 1979 and 1980.<p>

    The sort of places Rush were booked to play were concert halls of
three and a half to four thousand capacity. I remember suggesting that
maybe the band had bitten off a little more than they could chew.<p>

    We arrived at Birmingham a little later than we needed to, had a
quick plate full of grease, eggs, and bacon at a local greasy spoon
and wandered next door to the Odeon.<p>

    By the time we had wandered into the auditorium the band were just
coming on stage. They were greeted with an ear-wobbling roar. The
audience rose to its feet and I looked around to find that the place
was packed tighter than a squat for sardines. I was amazed but this
response didn't prepare me for the show that followed. It still ranks
in my all-time top five of live gigs. The sound was immaculate, the
lighting superb, the music perfection and the performance superb.<p>

    We rushed backstage to see them afterwards - the band, the road
crew, their managers, and there I met Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil
Peart for the first time. To my surprise they weren't all seven foot
tall, nor were they exhibiting any signs of halos or celestial glows.
There were just three quiet men sitting in their dressing room
chatting to each other.<p>

    We suggested a party to celebrate this most spectacular and
successful opening night of a tour. They looked at each other and then
suggested that maybe they would prefer just to go back to their hotel,
order tea and ice cream from room service and crash out early.<p>

    I couldn't believe it. Being on the road with a rock band is
supposed to be synonymous with getting smashed and generally behaving
in a manner that would get the average person chucked out of one of
the more extreme night spots in Hamburg.<p>

    An unusual band, I mused to myself back at the hotel as Burnham
and I had a playful game of darts using a particularly abysmal
painting in the room as a board. I decided I'd have to see more of
them.<p>

    On that tour I went on to see them in Newcastle, Glasgow, London
(two nights), Sheffield, Manchester and Southampton. Each night was a
revelation. The show was as precisely perfect, and yet still
remarkably fresh, at every concert. In addition, every night was a
sell-out. It eventually dawned on even my feeble brain that I was
witnessing a rock and roll phenomenon. I was seeing a band break
through to the major league in Britain on only their second tour of
the country.<p>

    It shouldn't have taken me to the end of the tour in Southampton
to realise this, of course. If I'd done my homework a bit earlier I
would have seen long before the tour began that Rush were a huge
band. That British tour was a sell- out two solid months before it
started. Their first half dozen albums were selling as fast as they
could be brought into the country to a hardcore but rapidly burgeoning
legion of fans. What they were doing was breaking through in Britain
in exactly the same inevitable inexorable manner that they had done in
their native Canada and neighbouring United States.<p>

    What more can I say? I, like hundreds of thousands of others had
become a believer. But then Rush aren't a bad choice of a band to
believe in.<p>

 <font size=+2>G</font>eddy Lee and Alex Lifeson met in Sarnia, a suburb of Toronto. Alex
was born in Fernie, British Columbia, and Geddy came from Willowdale.
When they were 15 years old and still in high school, they teamed up
with a friend of Lifeson's called John Rutsey in order to play some
of the music that they enjoyed listening to.<p>

    Their influences were Led Zeppelin, Cream, Jimi Hendrix, Grand
Funk Railroad and Iron Butterfly and at first they were merely a group
of friends rehearsing inconspicuously together and occasionally
branching out to do the odd local high school dance or private party.<p>

    They drifted into the bar and club circuit when, at the beginning
of the 1970s the Canadian province of Ontario reduced its legal
drinking age from 21 to 18 - thus allowing the band to legally enter
such premises.<p>

    Despite being a hard working band - insofar as they could get
gigs, which wasn't easy at the time - there was little to distinguish
them from any other bunch of small-time musicians. That is, if you
don't count the prodigious volume they played at, according to legend.<p>

    Perhaps one of the most fortunate things in the band's early
career was that they came into contact with a gentleman by the name of
Ray Danniels who first met them when he promoted a show for them at a
South Ontario school. He was 16 years old at the time. He later became
their manager, selling his own management agency to help raise money
to record Rush's first album and teaming up with Vic Wilson who was
also an agent.<p>

   <font size=+2>T</font>owards the end of 1973 Wilson and Danniels fixed Rush up with a
 support gig for The New York Dolls at a concert hall in Toronto. It
 was the biggest audience they had faced in their four year career.
 Geddy Lee later said that their performance on that night wasn't
 particularly impressive from the band's point of view simply because
 the audience was so big.<p>

    However, due to their immense amount of rehearsing and live
gigging together, Rush put on a competent show which easily outshone
The Dolls who had never, in their career, really raised themselves
above a sort of studied decadent musical shambles.<p>

    It was at this point that Rush realised they could hold their own
in big halls in front of large audiences and they made a conscious
decision, with Wilson and Danniels, to go after bigger and better
shows - despite the fact that they would almost certainly lose money
which they could scarcely afford.<p>

Danniels and Wilson, in the meantime, managed to raise the cash to buy
the band some studio time. They realised that an album had to be
released as soon as possible if the band was not to lose its momentum.
By recording late at night and in small chunks at a time they managed
to buy studio time at a low rate. In addition, they saved more money
by getting a local, unknown producer to take care of the finished
sound for them.<p>

    That was the point where their career damn near stopped in its
tracks. The finished album was far short of what they had expected. It
was flat and lifeless and both the band and their managers realised
that it wouldn't get them anywhere in the sales market.<p>

    They raised more money and got hold of another local producer but
one who at least had a track record having worked with Canadian
outfits April Wine and Thundermug plus Britain's Procol Harum. That
man's name was Terry Brown who, as any Rush fan knows, was to figure
large in their career. He and the band entered Toronto Sound Studios
and in $9000 worth of studio time Brown did a hero's job capturing the
original roughness and raucous power which the band knew they had put
down on tape. The next step was to find a label that would release the
album.<p>
  
   Nothing doing. No-one was interested, though Danniels and Wilson
demonstrated their willingness to do any sort of deal at all just to
get the album into the market place and stand a chance of selling.<p>

   So they decided to set up their own label and release it
themselves. It says much for the tenacity and self-belief that Rush
and Wilson and Danniels had that such a step would seem logical. The
new label was called Moon Records and put out the first Rush album,
simply titled 'Rush', in a limited fashion in Ontario. With little or
no money available to them Rush couldn't afford the sort of promotional 
and advertising activity that one normally associates with the
release of a rock album. They were just hoping that their live work
and the honourable tradition of word of mouth would do the trick for
them. It did. The initial pressings of the album sold out rapidly and
created something of a stir.<p>

     Copies of the 'Rush' album were imported into the United States
and one of them ended up in the hands of the musical director of
Cleveland, Ohio, radio station WMMS, Donna Halper. She was so
impressed that she drew the attention of Mercury Records and New York
booking agency ATI to the existence of this hot new Canadian outfit
that didn't even have a record deal in the States. Halper reported to
Mercury, ATI and the band themselves (a friend of whom had sent the
record to Halper) that on the strength of just playing one track on
the radio the station had received at least 50 telephone calls from
listeners wanting to know who the band  was and where they could get
a copy of the album.<p>

   Both ATI and Mercury signed the band up. In the case of the latter
it's probable that two external factors helped Rush to break through
this most important of barriers - being picked up by a major record
company.<p>

  The first was that Mercury had The New York Dolls contracted to them
and there seems little doubt that reports of Rush's successful Toronto
gig with The Dolls had filtered back to the company. Secondly, Mercury
also had Bachman Turner Overdrive on their books - a Canadian band who
Mercury prided themselves on having discovered and who were making the
company a lot of money through international record sales. It seemed,
no doubt, providential to Mercury that another band from Canada should
also be falling into their laps.<p>
                          
  All credit to Mercury though. They contracted Rush to a two album
deal and shelled out 200,000 dollars for the privilege - no mean
example of confidence, considering that no Canadian record company
seemed to fancy Rush at any price.<p>

  Between the release of 'Rush' in July, 1974 and the end of the year
the album sold around 75,000 copies in the United States alone.
However, round about this time, just as Rush could have been forgiven
for thinking they'd finally cracked it, they were faced with a major
problem. John Rutsey quit the band citing health reasons. He also had
different ideas from Lee and Lifeson about the musical direction the
band should take.<p>

  Geddy Lee recalled later that Rutsey's health really was bad as a
result, he reckoned, of the grueling live schedule that the band had
set for itself right from its beginning.<p>

  The departure of Rutsey was a major crisis point for Rush. The ATI
agency had fixed them up with an extensive series of dates in the
United States and now Rush didn't have a drummer.<p>

  With the tour coming up in August, 1974, - remember their
all-important debut jaunt outside their native Canada - Rush had to
find a replacement. They did - a gentleman by the name of Neil Peart.<p>

  Peart was to have a radical effect on Rush's future. As a drummer he
has been rated among the best rockers in the world but more important
to the developement of the band was his remarkable skill as a
lyricist.<p>

  Growing up near Toronto Peart had been a voracious reader, immersing
himself in science fiction of all kinds, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien
and Russian-born authoress the late Ayn Rand (remember that last name
  it gets really important later on). These days he still tends to
read everything he can lay his hands on from Plato to Agatha Christie
to Thomas Hardy and still more science fiction and fantasy.<p>

  He was interested in music from an early age. His parents sent him
to piano lessons but he didn't particularly take to them, instead he
expressed a greater interest in the more rhythmic side of music. so
they gave in to the inevitable and paid for a year and a half of drum
lessons from the time he was 13 years old.<p>

  In the beginning Peart was most interested in the late Keith Moon of
The Who and his aggressive style of drumming. Later he began to pick
up on Carl Palmer, Bill Bruford, Michael Giles (the first drummer with
King Crimson) and so on - the more technically oriented
percussionists.<p>

  Like Lee and Lifeson, Peart went to high school where he began to
get involved in playing in school bands. He played with small-time
outfits around his home area and then, at the beginning of the
Seventies, went to London to see if it was possible to make a
full-time living out of music in what was then the rock capital of the
world.<p>

  Unlike fellow Canadian Pat Travers who was to do precisely that,
Peart had no luck. He ended up selling souvenirs in London's tourist
trap, Carnaby Street, before returning home when the money and the
impetus ran out.<p>

  He took a job as a salesman with his father who dealt in farm
equipment and eventually ended up as parts manager. At the same time,
though, Peart still maintained his connections with the music
business.<p>

  Anyway, with time running out for the start of Rush's first tour of
the States and the band still not having a drummer, Danniels [sic] and
Wilson desperately looking for a replacement for the departed John
Rutsey. After auditioning several who weren't up to scratch Rush
remembered Peart as being a drummer in the area who had sounded
interesting. The managers got in touch with Peart, he auditioned and
got the gig.<p>

  Says Peart: "lt just seemed to work out perfectly. We seemed to be
musically suited to each other and I seemed to fit in with the kind of
future directions they were talking about. Besides that we fitted
together well personally - we found we had a lot of things in common."
Quite how much impact Peart was to make on the band didn't manifest
itself until the fourth album, '2112', was released in March, 1976.
But that's getting ahead of the story.<p>
   
  Rush's first tour of the States lasted from August 19,1974, to
December 20 with the trio playing dates with bands like Rory
Gallagher, Uriah Heep, Blue Oyster Cult, the Italian pomp-rock band
PFM, Rare Earth, Manfred Mann and Wet Willie.<p>

  <font size=+2>T</font>he critics saw the band in wildly different lights. Cashbox,
reporting from a gig in New Jersey in October of 1974 was unaware that
John Rutsey was no longer in the band and suggested that he (Rutsey)
was "a driving musician." Geddy was likened not for the first time in
his life, to Robert Plant, and overall Rush were considered "a hard
driving rocking and rolling band very reminiscent of some early Led
Zeppelin."<p>
   
   Billboard quietly enthused about the same gig rating Geddy as a
vocalist of exceptional range, suggesting that Alex Lifeson displayed
stimulating guitar showmanship and that "there are no frills to the
band's music and it offers nothing new or startling, just a straight-
forward approach that is used to best effect on their original
compositions."<p>

  For Al Rudis in the Chicago Sun-Times Rush were nothing more than
"a Canadian group that appeared to be moving into the void left by
Grand Funk Railroad and Black Sabbath."<p>

  Pride of place, however, might well be saved for a gentleman by the
name of Marc Shapiro who, writing for the Hollywood Daily News about a
date at the Whisky A Go Go, said: "Rush's gig at the Whisky last night
can best be described as heavy metal tedium. The Canadian entry into
the 'let's learn three chords and become the new Black Sabbath' derby
relied on cliche riffs throughout its set and only twice did this
reporter perceive of anything resembling an imaginative riff."<p>

  He concluded by suggesting a couple of Rush's numbers were "predictable 
in the classic power trio mould and point to definite
possibilities for the band on the less discriminating cheap wine and
reds circuit."<p>

  The "reds" reference, by the way, is about downers, or barbiturates,
which is quite a popular cliche when writers are talking about loud
and heavy bands which they don't particularly like as in "The only way
to listen to Black Sabbath is with a bottle of red wine in one hand
and a fistful of reds in the other."<p>

  For the most part, however, reviews tended to be quite favourable,
if not exactly overwhelmingly enthusiastic, and Rush could have been
forgiven for thinking that they were off to a reasonable start in the
States.<p>

  After a short break over Christmas Rush were back in Toronto Sound
studios to record their second album, 'Fly By Night'. It was January
1975.<p>

  Oddly enough this follow-up album had a lot to live up to. I say
oddly enough because from the perspective of the Eighties 'Rush' is
very much the odd record out in the Rush collection. It's a gutsy hard
rocker, lacking the symphonic, Iyrical content, the intelligence and
literary style of subsequent collections.<p>

  However, 'Rush', was the biggest selling debut album that Mercury
had enjoyed in the States, even outshining fellow Canadians Bachman
Turner Overdrive's first. And all this despite the fact that the first
attempt at 'Rush' had been done in Toronto's Eastern Studios in just
eight hours after a gig, and that the clean up operation with Terry
Brown re-mixing and re-producing was done in just three days. It also
might be added that John Rutsey had been considered the band's chief
Iyricist and when he declared his intention of dropping out from the
band Geddy Lee had had to fill the gap - a task which he hadn't
relished.<p>
                              
  Peart, however, slid neatly into his new and additional role of
Iyric writer, at the same time lending an inspirational touch to
Lifeson and Lee. 'Fly By Night' boasted such gems as 'By-Tor And The
Snow Dog,' a classic tale of good versus evil couched in mythological
personalities, 'Rivendell' inspired by the village of the same name
in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord Of The Ringe, and of course 'Anthem'.<p>

  The latter was inspired by the novel of the same name by the
aforementioned Ayn Rand, an authoress who first became established in
the Thirties and one who had been read extensively by Peart.<p>

  "Anthem", published in 1938 remains Rand's best known book. Rand,
born in Petrograd, Russia - later to become Leningrad after the
Russian revolution emigrated to the United States where she carved out
a career as a playwright, novelist and film writer. Her pronounced
right-wing views were presumably a counterblast to what she had seen
happen to her native Russia.<p>
                    
  Her novel "Anthem" is set in a totalitarian state sited in a closed
city. The rulers of this particular society have declared that
personality should be nonexistent, there should be no individuality
and no rights. This anti-personality credo even extends as far as the
outlawing of the word "I". However, two rebels rediscover
individuality and break away.<p>

  Peart himself is very much a believer in individuality. He's stated
repeatedly in the past that he can't believe in a completely
egalitarian society because it's patently obvious that people are not
equal. It's this sturdy and unbending faith in his own ideas, as
unfashionable as they may be that has landed Peart in the centre of
controversy more than once. But he remains defiant and unrepentant. He
once told me heatedly: "I'm not a Fascist. I'm not some extremist.
Yes, I'm a capitalist and I believe in self-reliance - but not without
caring for other people. Actually I'm tired of talking about this. You
say what you like about the whole thing. You know enough about the band
to get it right."<p>

  In that particular case Peart was talking about a much later event -
a notable destruction job done by Miles in the NME in 1977, centered
round 'Anthem' and the later album, very much an expanded version of
the same theme,'2112'.<p>
