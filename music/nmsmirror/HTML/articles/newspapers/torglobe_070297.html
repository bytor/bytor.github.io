<font size=+1>DINOSAUR-ROCK BAND Rush HAS EVOLVED WITH THE TIMES</font><br>
<br>
     The power trio, the simple guitar, bass, drums lineup that was
     pioneered by Cream in the late sixties, was a concept that was doomed
     to the lifespan of a fruit fly.  Cream came and went in under three
     years, and virtually every other similarly styled outfit discovered
     the limitations of the three-person structure with one notable
     exemption.  Rush, the Toronto-based band that adopted the form in
     1969, is still going strong.  Monday night, the local outfit drew more
     than 15,000 fans young and old to the first show of it's two night
     stand at the Molson Amphitheatre.<p>

     Even considering the  favourite-son status, it's a remarkable
     achievement.  For more that a quarter of a century, Geddy Lee, Alex
     Lifeson and Neil Peart have been building and maintaining a career and
     a fan base that refuses to go away.  While other local favourites have
     blossomed and withered, Rush has soldiered on.  And Monday night's
     performance, actually a stop on the band's current North AMerican
     tour, fully illustrated why.<p>

     First off, the band has never treaded water. This is a band that form
     it's beginning has continued to evolve.  And Monday's marathon (almost
     three hour) performance showed this to a greater extent than any other
     local Rush appearance ever has.  During the course of its performance,
     Rush surveyed its career all the way back to its 1976 breakthrough
     album 2112, dipping into almost every release since then, and
     naturally topping off with selections from it's current Test For Echo.<p>

     Closing off the first half with the entire 2112 suite, and juxtaposing
     that with such bookends as Nobody's Hero and Test For Echo, showd just
     how much the band has grown.  2112, typifying the band's early years,
     was a sprawling, multifaceted work that owed much tot he sonic
     diddling of such seventies English progressive rockers as Yes,
     containing abrupt and often inexplicable changes in rhythm and tempo,
     2112 was and is the kind of lengthy and pretentious work that
     wasresponsible for driving music fans into the love'em or hate'em
     camps.  Based on writing of Ayn Rand, it combined the band's sci-fi
     leanings with the themes of free will and individualism.  Performing
     it Monday night was a risky undertaking for the band, using as it did
     a large chunk of stage time for a number that many of the band's
     younger fans wreen't familiar with.<p>

     But performing 2112 did show how sophisticated musically, lyrically
     and thematically the band has become since then.  Numbers such as
     Nobody's Hero, Hald the World, Roll the Bones, Resist and Virtuality,
     all performed Monday, push the borders of the rock-trio approach far
     beyond what anyone might have imagined 20 years ago.  Simply put, the
     band survives because it is still interesting.<p>

     Like all Rush performances, this was padded outh with a plethora of
     intriguing video images, projected on a Jumbotron that had been
     installed behind the trio.  These cutting-edge images have always
     presented a visual focus for the band, given that each of the three
     members has always been more interesting in making music than creating
     personal images.<p>

     Granted, not every concert favourite was performed Monday night, but
     then the band has released about 20 discs in it's career, so a few
     popular numbers had to go missing.  But with YYZ, and Tom Sawyer and
     the Spirit Of Radio among two dozon numbers performed, no true Rush
     fan went away unhappy.<p>

     All Told this was yet again, a triumphant homecoming.<p>
