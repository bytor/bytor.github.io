<font size=+2>The St. Petersburg Times<br>
March 4, 1994</font><p>

<font size=+1>In no hurry to change</font><br>
<b>by Tony Green</b><p>

You know you've been around a long time when you've outlasted a label.<p>

After nearly a quarter-century, the term "progressive rock" sounds flaccid.
It catches in your throat.  So what do you call Rush, these fortysomething
guys with the monstrous chops, whose music occupies the "densely complicated"
edge of the rock spectrum?<p>

Alterna...? Forget it.  Never mind.  Committed?  How about cool?<p>

Nah, that couldn't be Rush.  But then again...<p>

"It's a generational thing," drummer Neail Peart, songwriter and lyricist for
the Canadian trio said recently by phone.  "We've been around for 20 years so
a log of the bands that are popular now were influenced by us.  I've spoken to
musicians who have told me that we were the first concert they ever went to.
And now all the cynical critics have been forced to accept us because a lot of
the musicians in the alternative bands grew up listening to us."<p>

Which must be a redeeming kind of vibe for the trio (Alex Lifeson on guitar,
Geddy Lee on bass and vocals and Peart on drums) who have endured years of
critical scorn to become one of rock's top concert draws.  Not to mention a
stated influence on respected rockers like Pearl Jam, Living Colour and
Primus, as well as the focus of a legion of intensely loyal fans.<p>

"I remember being on stage and thinking 'Why?'" Peart told the San Francisco
Chronicle.  "All these people still come back to see us.  I guess it's a
holistic thing, where the sum is greater than the parts.  It must be this
larger thing that surrounds us like an aura -- the sounds we create together
and the integrity and dedication we bring to it."<p>

The group, formed in 1974 in Canada, first forged its style from a heavy dose
of Led Zeppelin, Cream and Jimi Hendrix, laced with science-fiction themes
(Peart, a reader of authors from Camille Paglia to Carl Jung to Nietzsche,
writes the lyrics).  After a while words like "pretentious," and
"grandstanding" started to crop up in critical discussions of the band, likely
because of its love of odd time signatures, motivic arrangements and fusionoid
soloing.  Peart admits the band did start out on the "technique for
technique's sake" trip.<p>

"When we first started we didn't so much write songs as we created musical
pieces that allowed us to express our musicianship," he said.<p>

The trio's 1981 disc, Moving Pictures, represented a commercial zenith,
drawing from fusion, new wave and African pop.  But the years after that
weren't pleasant for Peart and the band.<p>

"What dark days those were for real musicians," Peart said.  "With all that
light metal and stuff.  Meanwhile we were trying to hold up the flag for
integrity and all those things."<p>

And, he says, there's nothing wrong with being complex.  Even though the
group's recent album Counterparts is more stripped-down and pop-oriented than
some other releases, playing Rush music is still not for the faint of chops.<p>

"You really can't do without technique," Peart said.  "It's a pain in the
neck, but some people can get over it, and learn to use it as something more
than just digital facility.  But I have no patience with musicians who say
'well I never practice, I just play what I feel.'  Well, if you don't
practice, what you play is going to be limited.  I can tell the difference
between a master playing something simply and someone else playing simply
because it's all he knows."<p>
