I'm high, I think I'll die<br>
This feeling inside me says to spew on the floor.<br>
Move your ass, out of my path.<br>
While I make way for the bathroom door.<p>

Hurl by night all over here<br>
We're all f---ing plastered.<br>
Let's go out and get some beer,<br>
And take advantage of the chicks while they're here.<p>

Moonshine, tastes so fine.<br>
If you think you'll spew try to make it outside.<br>
No fright, poor eyesight<br>
Soon we'll all have that empty feeling inside.<p>

Hurl by night all over here<br>
We're all f---ing plastered<br>
Get the chicks to drink more beer<br>
Cause if there's no action I think I just might turn queer.<p>

Hurl by night all over here<br>
We're all f---ing plastered<br>
Get those cops right out of here<br>
So they don't confiscate the last of our beer.<p>

Tap that new keg and I'll get more plastered.<br>
My mind will die away.<br>
Drink till I'm heavin' for no f---ing reason,<br>
All night and through the day.<p>

Senses are dancing,<br>
My guts aprehensing<br>
The beer keg drips away.<br>
Suck the beer foam and your guts will be thrown man.<br>
Our lives will end this way.<p>

Hurl by night all over here.<br>
We got f---ing plastered.<br>
We drank gallons and gallons of beer.<br>
Two thousand one hundred twelve ounces I fear.<p>
