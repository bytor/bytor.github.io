"Between Sun and Moon" - original poem by Pye Dubois

There is a lake between sun and moon
Not too many know about
Some go there for their high noon
Some go there for their midnight moon
It is a moment between silence and shout
Maybe you, might as well me
Why the sun, why the sun

Say yes, say yes, ahh say yes to self-esteem

We want to escape because we don't want to fall in
The signs are clear and so is the fear
We do not trust the firmness of the ground

Then say yes, say yes, ahh say yes to self-esteem

There is a fine place between actor and audience
This is the fine line
The fine line of living
This moment experienced
This fine deliverance
Do what you want to do in no ordinary way
Say what you need to say in no ordinary way
And sing what must be sung in no ordinary way

Say yes, ahh please, please say yes to self esteem

Some go there for their high noon
Some go there fo their midnight moon

It is the moment between silent and shout
This is a fine place
Faces face to face
These bonfire eyes
In the lake of the sky
It is our light to land and leave
Never so dark to unravel the weave
Never give up and never say die

Do what you need to do in no ordinary way
Say what you need to say in no ordinary way
And sing what must be sung in no ordinary way
