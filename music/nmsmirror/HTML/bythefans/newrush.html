<em>December 2, 1993</em>
<p>

I've been frantic with frustration<br>
I've been pacing in my room<br>
I'm a restless young fanatic<br>
Want to hear the new Rush tune<p>

I'm having problems with my parents<br>
I've been shaking in my sleep<br>
Just to hear some new Rush rhythms<br>
Am I some kind of freak?<p>

Trying to ease my ears with the Old Rush Song<br>
Trying to freeze my fears that it's the Last Rush Song<p>

I don't care what most people say<br>
I know that Rush is here to stay<br>
Yeah, I've been told to get a life<br>
And to change my childish behavior<br>
If they just knew that what I need<br>
Is music from my saviors<p>

It's the New Rush Song<p>

Got a short-wave receiver<br>
Scanning L.A. to Montreal<br>
Trying to hear the lastest word<br>
But I've heard none at all<p>

But now I hear a D.J. mention<br>
Some bones that rock and roll<br>
As I receive this revelation<br>
I lose my self-control!<p>

Planning to blow my mind with the New Rush Song<br>
Planning to show mankind that it's a Good Rush Song<p>

These song are good, these songs are great<br>
Because Rush is God - incarnate<br>
They are the Holy Trinity<br>
I can scientifically prove it<br>
They're wise enough to rule the world<br>
I wish that they'd just do it<p>

It's the New Rush Song<p>

Waiting for the next album, I hope it won't take long<br>
Because the New Rush Song is now the OLD Rush Song!<p>

It's the New Rush Song<br>
It's a Good Rush Song<p>
