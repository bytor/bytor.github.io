<strong>
Trent Reznor loves them. Soundgarden loves them. Primus, Metallica, and even
Fishbone love them. And with a new album and tour, the members of Rush are 
finding a whole new generation of fans appreciating them as well. Greg 
Edwards hooks up with singer/bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson at
their homebase in Toronto to find out why.
</strong><p>

In 1968, when bassist Geddy Lee joined Rush and was told that he'd have to 
sing -- a prospect he didn't relish -- he probably never imagined that he'd 
still be doing it 28 years later. Especially a few months later, when they 
kicked him out. <p>

But Lee soon returned, and with guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil
Peart (who replaced John Rutsey after their 1974 debut), Rush went on to 
become one of the most influential bands in rock. Individually, each member
is respected as a top-calibre instrumentalist, against whom bass players, 
guitarists, and percussionists measure their growth (Peart, specifically, 
earned such stature that the phrase "a Rush-influenced drummer"
is almost a cliche). But it's together that they've made the greatest impact, 
inspiring such bands as Primus, nine inch nails, and even Fishbone.<p>

In fact, this past summer's Lollapalooza -- given such nicknames as 
Metalpalooza (for its heavy content), and Larsapalooza (for Metallica's Lars
Ulrich) -- should've been called Rushapalooza: both Metallica and Soundgarden 
drink heavily from the fountain of Rush (the former comparing themselves
frequently), while Rancid play the kind of punk that came about as a reaction 
to Rush's prog-rock ilk.<p>

Oh, and Joey Ramone kind of looks like Geddy Lee.<p>

Yet despite all this recognition as members of rock's elite, the band members 
remain modest.<p>

"It's hard to put yourself in the position of saying,
'Oh, my music is influencing the way somebody else's
life is going,'" says Lee. "You don't want to take
responsibility for somebody else's life; it's hard
enough taking responsibility for your own. You do
feel complimented, and it does make you look at your
own music differently, because it makes you feel like
what you're doing has some value, but it doesn't bear
thinking about for too long."<p>

Not that Lee and his mates would think about such
things anyway -- they just don't have the time. They
recently had to force themselves to take a vacation,
and even then they were still busy: Lee and his wife
added another child to their clan; Lifeson recorded a
solo album, <strong>Victor</strong>, in his home studio; and Peart
indulged in his latest hobby, cross-country
motorcycling. And then they wrote and recorded <strong>Test
For Echo</strong>, their sixteenth studio album (and twentieth
overall).<p>

A complex and mature but still heavy album, <strong>Echo</strong>
is liable to surprise a number of people, especially
those who gave up on the band when they expanded
their guitar/bass/drums sound to include keyboards in
the late '70s. It has all the Rush trademarks -- Peart's
percussive drumming, Lifeson's soaring guitars, and
Lee's multi-rhythmed bass and distinctive vocals -- but
in more measured doses.<p>

It also, like such recent Rush albums as
<strong>Counterparts</strong> and 
<strong>Roll the Bones</strong>, has fewer keyboards
than <strong>Signals</strong> and 
<strong>Grace Under Pressure<?strong>. So few, in
fact, that it's as if they got to the studio and asked
each other, "Did you pack the keyboards?" "No, I thought you did."<p>

"I think the attractive thing about Rush has always
been the three of us playing together," Lifeson
explains. "Over the years, maybe from the mid-'80s
on, that whole perspective got much broader. But we
just wanted to get back that emotional core that we had."<p>

"<strong>Power Windows</strong> and <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> were just
drowning in keyboards," Lee adds, "because we found that to be a really 
interesting time for that kind of music. But now we're not as interested in 
that."<p>

They've even entered into a completely different realm on the song "Half the 
World," which features a mandola, a Celtic-sounding acoustic instrument, kind 
of like a mandolin crossed with a hurdy gurdy. "I just wanted to try it," 
explains Lifeson, almost sheepishly.  "So I just futzed around to get a feel 
for it, and it changed the whole personality of the song. I remember Ged when 
he first heard it was like, 'Whoa, I don't know about that.' It was so unusual 
for a Rush song to have that kind of texture. But it grew on him really 
quickly. I think it's probably his favorite part of the album." <p>

"This was the first time we've had any time left after we've finished an 
album," adds Lee, "so I was still sitting down in the studio cutting it up and 
editing it and playing around it. But then, I would change it 'til my dying 
day; I'm always looking for that perfect arrangement. And how do you know when 
you've got the perfect arrangement for a Rush song? It's such a weird 
arrangement anyway. You can't judge it by conventional standards. It's why 
having a release date is a really important thing, because it gets it out of 
my hands.<p>

"Though when we do finish an album," he continues, "I'm really high on it to 
a certain degree.  But I'm also really pissed off at it because it didn't go
exactly where I heard it go in my head sometimes <em>[he taps his 
temples]</em>. That's partially due to the democratic process, and partially 
due to the fact that it takes six months to make a bloody album, so by the
time you've finished it you've already gone somewhere else."<p>

Of course, some of it may also have to do with the
fact that the band members don't get to work out the
kinks on the road, playing their songs live a bunch of
times before setting them in stone. "We did that a
couple times in the late '70s and early '80s," Lee
recalls. "But that's when we were touring all the time,
and it was easy to slip in new material. But I don't
think anybody would be into doing it now. These
days, getting everybody to agree to tour is a
monumental feat."<p>

"If there's one aspect of what we do that's a little
more difficult to deal with now than in the past," adds
Lifeson, "it's touring. We all have different feelings
about it. In Ged's case, he needs it -- I don't know if he
enjoys playing live so much anymore."<p>

Which explains why Rush's upcoming tour is so
sporadic. Two weeks on, two weeks off, jumping
from place to place. And if you live in Europe, forget it.<p>

But then, you probably already have. "I'm afraid
that we haven't paid enough attention to Europe," Lee
admits. "We have a lot of fans over there, and every
four or five years we go over and do a token tour.
But if you don't go over there like everybody else and
tour every album, you're going to fall out of public
consciousness -- I think that's what's happened to us."<p>

In fact, in the last few years the band even
considered quitting altogether. Both Lee and Lifeson
admit to having some doubts about whether they
wanted to make another album, yet all hesitations
were swept aside when the threesome started writing
and found that the passion was still there.<p>

Lifeson even says they've already got ideas for
their next studio album, though they'll precede that
with a live disc (every fourth Rush album has been
followed by a live one). Still, as any Rush fan will tell
you, with these guys nothing is certain. When asked
point-blank if they'll split after the live album, Lee
grins before relenting, "I can't say 100% for sure, but
I doubt it. I think there's more music still to be
written."<p>
