<strong>From Circus -- November 30th 1982</strong></font><br>
<em>by John Swenson </em><p>

The second live Rush album, <strong>Exit... Stage Left</strong>, is now followed
by Signals, an album that represents a big step forward for this
band. For the first time, Rush seem in absolute control of the
shape and character of every note and musical passage on the
record. Neil Peart's multi-layered percussion effects have more
depth and presence; Alex Lifeson's guitar treatments have acquired
a spectacular edge; and Geddy Lee's bass and synthesizer parts have
never been so well integrated into the overall picture.  <P>

What's more, Lee's singing has a newfound solidity and tonality. This
remarkable transformation may be due in some part to the band's
growing familiarity with digital recording techniques, but the
lion's share of the credit must go to the personal diligence of the
players themselves.  <p>

Early Rush songwriting tended to be
longwinded, as they developed increasingly elaborate concepts. But
the Permanent Waves studio album represented a move to shorter
tunes. <strong>Signals</strong> matches that precision and concise songwriting with
a more generalized approach that fans of such epics as <strong>2112</strong> will
find enjoyable. "Subdivisions," with its theme of socio-electronic
alienation, could easily be an excerpt from a work of larger scope.
The same could be said of the characters presented in "Digital
Man," "The Analog Kid" and "New World Man." <p>

"Countdown," a
dramatization of a spacecraft launch complete with authentic NASA
in-flight recordings, is one of the best ideas Rush have ever
translated to song. Investing a real-world event with mythical
power previously reserved for science-fiction fantasies is an
important step for Rush, and one which helps illustrate to the
group's followers that magic and mystery are present not just in
romantic histories or works of speculative fiction, but in the
world around them.<p>

   On their twelfth album, Rush makes a strong argument for the view
that advanced technology is not necessarily the same thing as
progress. Unfortunately, they do so largely by screwing up. Although
<strong>Signals</strong> is chockablock with state-of-the-studio gadgetry, ranging
from the requisite banks of synthesizers to the latest in digital
recording and mixing, none of these electronic add-ons enhances the
group's music. If anything, Rush emerges from this jungle of wires
and gizmos sounding duller than ever.<p>
   The band's chief error seems to have been emphasizing
synthesizers at the expense of Alex Lifeson's guitar. Because Rush's
concept of synthesized sound is so narrow -- consisting mainly or
the vague whooshing sounds that are the aural equivalent of dry-ice
fog -- the band tends to sound like it is trapped in wads of lint.
With no edge to work against, Geddy Lee's congested vocals float
through the songs like swamp gas. Ultimately, it's up to drummer Neil
Peart's hyperkinetic thrashing to hold the performances together.<p>
   Ironically, Rush falls into this technological morass on an album
that is otherwise their most poppish yet. By and large, the songs on
<strong>Signals</strong> are tuneful and unencumbered by the sort of gratuitous
flash that made previous albums seem like clearinghouses for
worn-out art-rock licks. Even so, it's mostly a wasted effort, and
nearly all of Rush's <strong>Signals</strong> come across as static.
