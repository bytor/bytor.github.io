<font size=+1>Thinking man's rock still pushing, hard-rocking Rush
admits to ambition, not pretension</font><p>

<b>by Greg Haymes</b><p>

"The thinking-man's hard rock band."<p>

That tag seems to have followed Rush around almost since the Canadian power
trio released its first album some 17 years ago. <p>

Confronted with the description during a phone interview earlier this week,
Rush's drummer-lyricist Neil Peart emitted a weary groan.<p>

"Well, it's not exactly inaccurate," he admitted during a stop in Providence,
R.I., on the band's current tour, which brings them to the Knickerbocker Arena
tonight, "but I think that it perhaps sends the wrong message to the 
non-cognoscenti. To people who don't know very much about our music, it 
suggests a certain kind of pretentiousness, which is just not part of the 
equation for us at all.<p>

"We have certainly over-shot ourselves sometimes, but, to me, being
over-ambitious is quite the opposite from being pretentious. We're not
pretending to some ambition. Rather, we're occasionally too ambitious for our
own good," he says frankly with a self-knowing chuckle.<p>

"We'll be the first to admit that our work has been uneven, and that some of our
experiments haven't worked out. But that's the price of admission for us.<p>

"We keep pushing ourselves and our music, and whenever you take chances,
you run the risk of going wrong sometimes."<p>

There's no denying that the Toronto-based trio -- which also features
vocalist-bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson -- is indeed a smart band
of rockers, but Peart doesn't think that Rush is too cerebral for its own 
good.<p>

"Some people, I'm sure, think that we take ourselves too seriously, but again, I
think that the exact opposite is true," Peart says. "We don't take ourselves
seriously at all, but we take our work very seriously, and we think it's
incumbent on us to do the best job that we possibly can.<p>

"When we walk onstage, we're professionals, but offstage, we're just as goofy
as any other bunch of guys in a band."<p>

The three band members have made a conscious effort to avoid artistic
stagnation and loosen up their musical approach with "Roll the Bones," their
latest album.<p>

"For such a long time, it was our goal in live performances just to try to 
play as well as we sound on the records. That was the highest challenge for 
us," says Peart.<p>

"I think that we pretty much attained that, so then we stepped back and asked
ourselves, 'Well, what's wrong with that?'<p>

"We decided that we wanted to add some more spontaneity to our music. So
right from the start of this tour, we started changing the arrangements and
various instrumental bits, even on the brand new songs.<p>

"With my own drumming, too, I know that I have a tendency to be too
organized, too architectural about my parts. So for 'Roll the Bones,' I tricked
myself. In spite of all the rehearsal I did before we recorded, I left areas 
that I refused to work out. Right down to the day that I recorded, I didn't 
know what I was going to play in that particular part of the song, so that 
something special might happen.<p>

"I think that there's a intangible sense of being on the edge and not playing it
safe that is communicated to the listener."<p>

Peart concedes that thematically Rush's songs often deal with big issues, which
sets them apart somewhat from so many hard rock bands, whose subject matter
is usually limited to just three topics -- girls, girls and more girls.<p>

"Roll the Bones," is no exception to Rush's ongoing exploration into the
meaning of life. "We're trying to reconcile a random universe without being
futile about it," explains Peart, who wrote the all of the lyrics.<p>

"I've dealt a lot with free will in the past, and that's something that I 
continue to champion. But there is so much randomness, and as I was trying to 
deal with the idea of a random universe, that I was driven to the elemental 
question of 'Why are we here?'<p>

"I finally decided that it was the wrong question," he says. "The reason why
we're here is because we're here. There was a big bang and then a universe.
Then a fish crawled out of the sea and walked on land. Then my mother and
father got together, and I was born. It seemed self-evident to me.<p>

"The real question ought to be 'What can we do about it?' There is so much
tragedy in life that is just chance occurrence. That's why I included the lines,
'Why are little ones born only to suffer/For the want of immunity/Or a bowl of
rice?' in the album's title song.<p>

"The question is not 'Why am I here?' but 'How can I maximize my life?' It's
not 'Why does this tragedy happen?' but rather 'How can I help?'<p>

"Those are difficult questions to deal with because for a lot of people the
concept of a random universe is terrifying. Obviously, the purpose of religion
and a lot of political societies is to try to distance ourselves from that 
ultimate gulf.<p>

"Yes, we can change things if we motivate ourselves along a certain path," he
concludes, "but there are so many things that can go wrong along the way.
There's an awful big element of chance in the world."

<font size=+1>Rush a streamlined powerhouse</font><p>

<b>By Greg Haymes</b><p>

Albany -- "Why are we here? Because we're here," proclaimed Geddy Lee.<p>

No, he wasn't a philosophy professor delivering an introductory lecture in
Existentialism 101 at Albany State.<p>

Rather, Lee was the bassist-vocalist of the Canadian power-rock trio Rush, and
that basic, little Q-and-A exchange during the song "Roll the Bones," was at
the core of their arena-rock extravaganza at the Knickerbocker Arena Thursday
night.<p>

The near-capacity crowd of enthusiastic fans knew exactly why they were there,
however, and it wasn't for the philosophy of it all, by any means.<p>

"Rush rocks," the fans proclaimed over and over again, nearly as loudly as the
band's own high-decibel rampage.<p>

Rush has never been afraid of tackling big issues with their lyrics (for
example, the illusion-vs.-reality debate of "Presto" album or the struggle
between fate and chance that dominates their current "Roll the Bones" LP), but
there's always been a big, bruising backbeat behind the words.<p>

In the late '70s, the band -- which also features guitarist Alex Lifeson and
drummer Neil Peart -- was a perfect example of the kind of wretched musical
excess that that decade spawned.<p>

But, in recent years, Rush has developed into a streamlined rock-and-roll
powerhouse, discarding the excess baggage in favor of more accessible pop
melodies and straight-ahead arrangements. Nobody's about to mistake these guys
for the Ramones, mind you, but less is definitely more in the current Rush
music mode.<p>

What's most surprising is that they've somehow managed to maintain the muscle
and sharped the crisp cutting edge of their musicianship along the way.<p>

Lee reined in his shrieking helium-voiced howl, and during songs like "Show
Don't Tell" and "Dreamline," he instilled his vocals with dynamic
discipline.<p>

Lifeson and Peart both played with considerably more economy than they've
displayed in the past, even during their requisite solos.<p>

Although they've pared back the complexity of their music, Rush still hasn't
trimmed any of the special effects from their multi-media stage spectacle. In
a non-stop parade of typical arena-rock showmanship, Rush assaulted fans with
mega-watt lighting, billowing fog, razor-sharp lasers and a surround-sound,
quadrophonic speaker system, as well as a barrage of rear-projection films and
videos.<p>

While their musicianship was quite commanding on songs like "Bravado" and "The
Pass," the trio's stage presence was not. All too often the three musicians
onstage were completely buried under an avalanche of special-effects gimmickry
that made them seem lifeless and mechanical. With all the theatrical,
high-tech hoakum that bombarded the crowd, the music itself seemed almost
incidental.<p>

And let's not forget that pair of giant white rabbits that popped out of top
hats during the climactic cruise through "Superconductor," either. Why were
they there? Well, because they were there, I guess.<p>
