I honestly believe that this is THE best bootleg out there. From the packaging 
it may not look like much, but as RNR92 so eloquenty proved before, 
awesome-sounding recordings can come in crappy-looking packages.<p>

This is a soundboard recording of the best quality -- the guitar, drums, i
vocals, bass, everything sounds crisp and clear (and I'm listening to this 
through my Macintosh speaker!) The audience comes through at the appropriate 
times; no annoying screaming fans here! This was the last night of the
Counterparts tour in Toronto, and you can tell that the band is in fine form,
from the incredible intro to "Cold Fire" to Alex's comments during "Closer To
The Heart". Not only do you get the great sound, but also hear Rush in their
hometown, on the last night of the tour. The ONLY negative thing I have
to say about the show itself is that for some reason, the encore is left
off this CD.<p>

The packaging is pathetic. There is no mention of a manufacturer, other than
it was made in Italy. In fact, the ony way to tell disc 1 from 2 is that the
first one is blue, the second pink. At least they got the songs in the right
order on the back. Indexing for the most part is done well, Xanadu is 
a separate track from the brief inclusion of Hemispheres. The only track
problem is with "Mystic Rhythms", which starts a few seconds before the
index does. <p>

Definitely run, don't walk, and grab this cd up! Even without the encore,
this cd is one of the best (if not THE best) out there today!<p>
