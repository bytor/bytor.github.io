<em>October 28, 1991</em>

He's got a crapload of adverts<br>
A radio fix on the stars<br>
All along the airwaves<br>
She's got the latest Rolling Stone<br>
A picture book of the posers<br>
Playing the Sahara<p>

They travel in the time of the profits<br>
On invisible airwaves promoting beer-drinking as fun<br>
Like losers and bozos, and the witless part of everyone<br>
They're only at home when "Rockline" is on<br>
"Rockline" is on<p>

The band has the intelligence of balsa wood<br>
A list of cheap groupies<br>
All along the tour<br>
They'll throw your sister out on her ass<br>
After she delivers a decent blowjob<br>
Lead guitarist with his pants down<p>

They travel on the road to the Grammies<br>
A highway of album sales that the interview brings<br>
Like losers and bozos, lip-synching means that nobody sings<br>
They can only perform with their tape machines<br>
Tape machines<p>

When fans are dumb<br>
Wandering the face of the dial<br>
Asking the same questions with an asinine smile<br>
We're learning that Bob Coburn is too dull<br>
For an unlimited time<p>

"Why don't you play all your old stuff?<br>
 What does YYZ stand for?<br>
 Why was John Rutsey shitcanned?<br>
 Will Geddy play at my bar mitzvah?<br>
 What's Alex's favorite color?<br>
 Was Neil influenced by Ayn Rand?"<p>

The microphone is manned by a buffoon<br>
If I had my way he'd be given the boot<br>
Like Jimmy and Tammy, he's in it only for the loot<br>
He's only at home in a leisure suit<br>
A leisure suit<p>

He travels on the road to the next show<br>
On a primetime pathway straight to Heart and Bryan Adams at #1<br>
Like Collins and Petty, and the Top 40 part of everyone<br>
If I'm only at home it's with a CD on<br>
FM's gone...<p>
