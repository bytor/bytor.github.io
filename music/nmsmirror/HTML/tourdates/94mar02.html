<font size=+1>RUSH LYRICIST PEART YEARNS FOR CHANCE TO PLAY BIG BAND</font><br>
<b>by Dan Macdonald</b><p>

     For the past 20 years, Neil Peart has been content to be the drummer
and lyricist for the rock band Rush.  While he has no intentions of
changing jobs, but if he did, he knows just where he would go.<p>

     Peart would like to go from the three-man rock format to the 'big
band' jazz sound.<p>

     "Big Band music is what I'd like to play on the side," Peart said
during a telephone interview prior to a show in Atlanta last week.  "It's
like playing Rush music.  It's concieved architechturally but with lots of
room for fooling around in the middle."<p>

     The big band career will have to wait as Rush is in the midst of a
tour that brings it to the Jacksonville Coliseum tonight.<p>

    Peart is content with the setup he has with bandmates bassist/vocalist
Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson.  The band works in a two year cycle
of writing, recording and touring that brings them back to Jacksonville
almost two years to the day from their last Coliseum appearance. While that
sounds a little regimented, Peart was quick to disagree.<p>

     "It's a self-chosen cycle," he said. "That's the ironic thing.  It
takes a lot of years for a band to develop the autonomy to be able to say
we will work then and now and in this fashion.<p>

       "It's quite the contrary of a rut because it is not imposed on us.
It is something that we have developed as a comfortable cycle of work."<p>

       The band seems to find its comfort level in all aspects of it's
work. Peart said most Rush songs fall between 4.5 and 5 minutes in length
and after they put a stop-watch to a newly developed show it seems to
always clock out at right about 2 hours.<p>

       That's the way it has been for the band since it's earliest days of
headlining. The Tornoto based band was formed in 1969 and released it's
self-titled debut album in 1974.  Originally, it was John Rutsey behind the
drums.  But he quit the band just after the release of <b>Rush</b>.<p>

     The band's tendency to play extended instrumental jams has brought it
comparisons to Yes. But it has had more radio success on the Classic Rock
format stations with such songs as "Tom Sawyer", "Closer to the Heart" and
"Big Money" and they even had a top 40 pop hit in 1982 with "New World
Man".<p>

     As a trio, Rush has fought the temptation to simply let a tape run to
to fill in studio effects and keyboards that would otherwise necessitate
additional bodies on the stage.  Instead, they use synthesized switches and
foot pedals to trigger musical "events" that rarely last longer than an
instant.  Thus, the three players are playing <b>all</b> of the music rather than
being accompanied by a tape.<p>

    There's no rule that says you can't play a tape, but with us it's a
moral thing, Peart explained.<p>

     "Every note that happens is triggered by one of us, which makes for
a bit of a dance. That's the ethic as far as we are concerned. Anything
that happens on stage <b>must</b> be played by one of us," he said.<p>

     Even with technology, it's no easy matter to make all of the sounds
happen at the precise moment.<p>

     "There are bits coming in tempo-wise that increase the challenge for a
drummer because there are keyboard samples coming in that are rooted to the
same time.  I have to be prepared during the course of the song for these
to come in and out.  Consequently, I have to nail the tempo exactly right
so that these do not come in to make it feel too fast or too slow," Peart
said.<p>

     Such a decision goes back to the very reasons a musician decides to
play the kind of music that he plays.<p>

     "There is an instinctive right and wrongness.  Musicians have to make
moral choices," Peart said. "You have to decide, are you playing for money
or are you playing for love? Even in the cover bands, do I want to play
what the audience wants to hear or what pleases me?<p>

      "A cover band I was in would play songs by people we liked regardless
of popularity.  That cut us off to a certain extent and narrowed our focus
on that end, but there is a much more long term chance of both independence
and longevity and not to mention job satisfaction."<p>
