Listeners will be quick to lose interest in Rush
</font><p>
<strong>By Tom Long</strong>, Detroit News Pop Music Critic<p>

Canadian rockers Rush made the transition from maybe-metal
to commercial-progressive quite a while back, and it has certainly
worked in terms of sales over the band's past two decades. Rush,
who plays the Palace at Auburn Hills on Friday, is a consistent
platinum player, and its latest CD, Test for Echo, is firmly
ensconced near the top of the charts these days.<p>

Problem is, Rush's idea of progressive isn't terribly forward
looking. Anything on Test for Echo could have been recorded in 1973 by the 
almost forgotten Uriah Heep. This is not progress, this is bad taste with 
staying power.<p>

Not that the three geezers who comprise Rush aren't fine musicians. Singer-bass 
player Geddy Lee has toned his pop-your-eyeballs-out screech down to an almost 
folky tenor, and guitarist Alex Lifeson lays an efficient mix of lines and 
chords over drummer Neil Peart's busy thumping. Polished players all.<p>

But the songs here strain to make statements about the modern condition while 
exhibiting the depth of a puddle. And much of the time the musical changes 
scream "This is impressive" when in fact they are fairly mundane.<p>

The album is perhaps epitomized by the absurd "Dog Years," wherein Lee cries 
out the chorus Dog Years - it's the season of the itch with operatic fervor 
over a storm of rousing instrumentation as if this is something powerfully 
affecting. Honest, it's not.<p>

Lee gets off some good lines, most notably in "Half the World" (Half the world 
hates what half the world does every day), but Rush spends so much time trying 
to be heavy it undercuts what few fine moments it can come up with. <p>

This music obviously works for 15-year-old boys hiding from homework with the 
headphones on. It has worked in that way for a long time now, and perhaps 
there's value in that (there's certainly money in it). But others encountering 
Rush will likely find themselves in a rush to turn the stereo off.<p>

<font size=+1>Rush puts some surprises in its 3-hour stage shows </font><p>
<strong>BY BRIAN MCCOLLUM</strong><br>
Free Press Pop Music Writer<p>

So much for self-indulgence.<p>

Neil Peart has 22 years worth of Rush records he can listen to, but he won't 
do it.<p>

The highly heralded drummer for the stalwart Canadian rock trio says he 
wouldn't dream of kicking back in his living room and spinning such albums as 
1974's "Fly By Night" or 1978's "Hemispheres." Too indulgent, he says -- and 
"just wrong."
<p>

So when it came time to carve a lengthy set list for the band's new tour -- the
first featuring three hours of music and no opening act -- Peart had to pull 
out old LP covers and scan song titles to refresh his memory.<p>

Some off-the-wall suggestions from Peart and his band mates, bassist Geddy Lee 
and guitarist Alex Lifeson, ultimately made it into the mix.<p>

"The three of us were sending faxes back and forth with potential lists," 
recalls Peart. "Some were intended to be ridiculous suggestions, but even some 
of those worked out. Somebody else would take it seriously and say, 'Well, 
wait a minute. What if we did <strong>this</strong>? It could really work.' "<p>

Skip this paragraph if you don't want to know what surprises may pop up tonight
at the Palace of Auburn Hills, but shows on the tour's first week have featured
such long-buried chestnuts as "Natural Science," "Red Sector A" and "2112" -- 
in its seven-part entirety.<p>

For fans of the virtuoso ensemble, news like that seems heaven-sent. Since 
taking Peart on board in 1974, the Toronto band has carefully emphasized its 
newest musical approach.<p>

With 16 studio albums -- including "Test for Echo" (Atlantic), which debuted at
No. 5 on Billboard's albums chart early this month -- there's certainly a hefty
body of work to choose from. Take away Aerosmith, whose membership fractured 
for several years in the early '80s, and Rush has the longest endurance record 
of any original rock lineup around. <p>

But fans hoping to hear something really <strong>odd</strong> -- say, "Losing 
It" from "Signals" or "Didacts and Narpets" from "Caress of Steel" -- may be 
out of luck. He won't name names, but suffice to say that plenty of the old 
material makes Peart squirm.<p>

"Do you want to see your kindergarten paintings hanging on the refrigerator?" 
he says with a laugh. "That's the unfortunate part of it -- so much of your 
growth and development takes place in public. That's tough, to know that 
things you did 23, 24 years ago are still out there in front of people. Of 
course it's embarrassing."<p>

With last week's tour kickoff in Albany, N.Y., the famously hard-working Rush 
just closed the biggest road break of its career. Since capping the 
"Counterparts" tour in mid-1994, band members have indulged in side projects 
(Peart's Buddy Rich tribute, Lifeson's solo disc), babies (Lee's new son) and 
even musical training (Peart has worked with a drum coach for two years).<p>

For Peart, roundly considered the top drummer in rock, taking time off wasn't 
exactly taking time off. Peart, 44, says two years off the road led to one of 
the most fertile musical periods he's ever enjoyed.<p>

"I spent the last two years in my basement basically playing drums for the 
spiders," he says. "And that did me more good musically than two years of 
touring -- or five years of touring -- would ever have done."<p>

Armed with renewed energy, the band went roaring into last winter's "Echo" 
sessions near Woodstock, N.Y. It had already run through the traditional Rush 
creative game plan: hunkering down at a house in the Canadian countryside, 
where Lee and Lifeson forged song structures while Peart toiled meticulously 
on the words that would fill them.<p>

"It's almost like a slowed-down session of an improvisational session of a 
three-piece group," Peart says. "We're responding to what each other is doing, 
trying to put forward our own ideas, and trying also to create something 
larger musically than any of those elements. Instead of happening spontaneously 
in the moment, it's happening over a slow period."<p>

The latest result -- a guitar-heavy album that rocks harder and more crisply 
than anything from Rush in the last 10 years -- should convince doubters that 
the longtime trio is anything but a bunch of old farts. But Peart stills 
foresees change for the band.<p>

Amid plans to record and release more Buddy Rich tribute material, Peart sees 
the grind of touring becoming a less efficient way to ease his musical itch.<p>

"In your building years there's nothing better you could do than go out and 
play every night on a stage and force yourself to that level. We would feel 
it, as a band, getting better and getting tighter as a unit, all of that," he 
says. "But of course once you've achieved that after 20 years, you have it."<p>

That doesn't mean he's complacent about playing in front of 20,000 demanding 
fans. When you're held up as the world's best drummer, and your band is 
expected to maintain on-a-dime performance standards, the pressure can get 
intense.<p>

"That's a tremendous challenge, to walk up those stairs every night, especially
with 20-odd years behind you, and a certain expectation from the audience about
how good the performance is supposed to be," Peart says. "You're no longer 
trying to prove anything to someone who doesn't know you. You're trying to 
live up to something.<p>

"It's the ultimate ordeal by fire."<p>

<em>Rush drummer talks past and future</em><p>

<strong>By BRIAN McCOLLUM</strong><br>
Free Press Pop Music Writer<p>

<strong>So what kind of show are we gonna see?</strong><p>
<blockquote>
Well, for the first time, we're gonna do an "Evening With" format, something
we've always stayed away from, because of course we came up as an opening act 
and we hated to close that door. It's such an alternative route. Without 
having radio or particular media support, as we didn't in the beginning, we 
were still able to go out and tour as an opening act and build an audience 
that way. In the short of it, we've always resisted that idea up 'til this 
point, based on that, a nd we finally decided that at this point in the 
program we owe ourselves that so rt of latitude. And of course for the 
audience too it'll be a quite larger scope of music that we're able to do, 
and a completely different format of presentation, so we thought, "OK, now's 
the time."<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>I know there's an intermission -- any sort of chronological division 
between halves?</strong><p>
<blockquote>
Nothing artificial like that. I think it would be really crazy to try to impose
an "early" or "late" time frame on them or anything. For us, it's more 
important that we can play the songs with a conviction, so songs are being 
chosen or rejected based on how they are to play. Which might sound selfish, 
but no one else has to play them a few dozen times over and over. You want to 
make sure that it's something you're gonna be comfortable with. And I think 
that translates to the audience in a subtle way, too. If they know that you're 
playing a song that you really believe in -- or don't! -- somehow that becomes 
apparent.<p>

We've been frivolous about it, and we've passed each other lists over the past 
few months of ridiculous choices -- "What do you think about doing this?" or 
"How about if we did that and did a rearrangement of it?" -- and entertaining 
all sorts of wild ideas, and whittling down what's possible from there.<p>

Even our non-short list was about 3 1/2 hours of music.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>
"Ridiculous choices"? What are some of the off-the-wall songs you're talking
about?</strong><p>
<blockquote>
That's a qualified term -- these are just songs we haven't even heard or 
thought of for tens of years. So just that -- we were kind of racking our 
brains for the least likely suspects, I guess, and trying to put them forward 
and actually consider them. And in fact some of them are being used. We're 
already into the process where some songs we might have thought we'd never 
play again or hadn't even thought of for a long time we have resurrected and 
brought back and gone, "Hey, this is good!" So there are pleasant surprises 
available there in the back catalogue.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Is it an attempt to give fans something they've been itching for?
</strong><p>
<blockquote>
You can't go with the pretend altruism. I mean, we're fans of the band too. One
thing about Rush is that it's a genuine reflection of ourselves at different 
times. If we can go back to a song from '78 or '82 or whatever and still 
connect with it, then great. And of course, the fan gets the benefit too.<p>

But we're not saying, "Hey, man, the fans would really like to hear that song, 
let's play that." That would be as phony as could be, as far as we're concerned.
So I think by accommodating one desire -- which is our own, to go back into the
archives and find interesting things -- we serve the interests of the fans as 
well.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>
Can you give me a couple of titles?</strong><p>
<blockquote>
Uhhh, not yet, of course.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>I knew you wouldn't.<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
No false promises! (Laughs) We might not end up doing any of them.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>There's word from close sources that this is the last tour.<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
I've heard that, honestly, for 10 years, every time we go on tour: "I hear this
is your last tour!" Yeah, sure it is. There's no answer to that, because no one
knows.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So this is not a grand finale...<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Not by plan, no.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>This last break was certainly longer than other stretches between 
albums and tours.<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Yeah, but not to us. I mean, from our point of view it was filled with so many 
interesting and productive things, and I've been fond of saying lately I 
accomplished more in my basement in the last two years than I ever would on 
two years of concert stages. So I'm not sure it was a break, really. It was 
kind of a sabbatical or something -- it was a working holiday, if you like, 
where everybody was very active and did some interesting things on their own, 
and brought all of that back into the fold to build from again. So it was an 
exciting break. It was an exciting reunion for us getting back together, and I 
think the music is the better for it. So it certainly wasn't a conscious 
revulsion, on our part, it wasn't a desire to step away from it all. It was a 
desire to do those things.<p>

It seems a perfectly natural thing to me that there were no bad feelings about 
it, there was no tension of "maybe we'll never work together," or anything 
like that. There just wasn't anything like that, that "sources close to the 
band" might tend to dramatize. It wasn't like that. It was a natural thing, as 
things that we do are.<p>

People want to always put more drama, more black and white, on things than 
there really is: "What do you plan when you get together from now on?" Well, 
we don't plan. We get together, and start playing, and see what happens. It's 
as genuine and organic as that, and if we don't do a tour or make a record, 
then we'll do something else that interests us or makes us excited. It's all 
part of the big thing. Without being a grand plan, it's certainly a grand 
architecture of some kind.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>    Give me a nutshell summary of "Test for Echo."<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
It's always a strange thing. On "Counterparts," any overarching theme really 
only appeared afterward, when I realized that it did deal with dualities and 
fundamental relationships in the literal sense, rather than the pop terminology.
This was the same really. They started out as individual essays. But of course 
they reflect a particular period of life and time, and even the little 
inspirational snippets that I've written down over the past few years, they 
all do reflect a time and a sensibility, so I suppose it's inevitable that 
they should also reflect a kind of unity, as much unity as a person's life is 
capable of, anyway.<p>

So I don't know. There are a lot of themes to me that are woven in there, and 
no song is about any one thing, certainly as far as I'm concerned. I try to 
weave as much in there as the basket will possibly hold. In the little bio 
thing I kind of settled on the overall theme of affirmation, which I thought 
was quite important throughout, and the echo being that if you go "hello," you 
want somebody else to say "hello." As simple as that. And the song ("Test for 
Echo") itself, looking around at the world and thinking, "This is weird -- 
does anyone else think this is weird?" You know, those kind of feelings, I 
think, are at play throughout.<p>

But at the same time there are many, many sub-themes and other little ideas 
woven into it. Questions of morality: "The Color of Right" and "Resist" both 
look at what morality consists of, and why it's different for one person than 
for another. You can say, "Well, I thought it was the right thing to do!" and 
the other person can say, "That was totally the wrong thing to do!" And I got 
to wondering how those kinds of divisions arise, especially in context of 
relationships.<p>

The phrase itself came out of my daughter's law homework. There's a point of 
Canadian law called "the color of right." And I just thought it was a beautiful 
metaphor to come out of legal language. Like I did in "Cold Fire" on 
Counterparts, a little argument between two people, I dramatized it and made 
it illustrate a larger concept. Those are really satisfying ways to go about 
it, where you can make something appear really personal and small when in fact 
it reflects something very large and abstract. Those are woven in there.<p>

"Time and Motion," too: seize the day, carpe diem, things as simple as that are
in there. So there's a lot of stuff in there, obviously, as much as I could get
into each line and each carefully weighed word, days and days of revisions and 
so on. It's always hard for me to then kind of turn around and contract that 
down to one little germ.<p>

You tell me.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Perhaps it's a glimpse at postmodern society four years from the 
millenium -- maybe the frazzled pace, or this concept of the global 
marketplace of ideas. With such a wide variety of belief systems to choose 
from, the paradigms continually shift. "Virtuality" and "Totem," particularly, 
speak to that. Is the "I" in "Totem" true first person, or are you in someone 
else's head?<p></strong>

<blockquote>
I would never use my first-person singular. It's always an imagined person. 
Somebody asked me recently, "Are you a solipsist?" I said, "No, I'm writing 
about other solipsists." (Laughs)<p>

It's true that on a bright sunny day the world looks really nice if you're in a
good mood, but if you're depressed or just in a bad mood, the sunniest day 
suddenly is dark. And the way people behave according to their moods really 
astounds me sometimes -- they're charging around in a bad mood, offending and 
upsetting people, as if they have the right to do that. And it is about exactly 
that kind of solipsism -- that the world does change according to how you feel. 
But again, the words are very carefully chosen. I said "how I feel changes how 
the world appears," not "how the world is." I think that's a really important 
distinction, and one that I was careful to make, because that's what I see 
these people doing.  <p>

I'm fairly gifted with equanimity, I guess, as far as being the same person 
every day mood-wise. But of course I see in the people around me all kinds of 
extremes of not only mood-swings but inflicted mood-swings -- moods used as an 
unshielded weapon sometimes. That really astonishes me. How come people think 
they can get away with that, and why do they think other people should have to 
put up with it? But they do, and so they behave, and I found that interesting, 
and wove it in there.<p>

And religion makes the perfect filter for that. People see the world in the way
their religion filter makes it appear. They see what appears.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So is it a stab at religion? Or are you embracing this school of 
subjectivism?<p></strong>

<blockquote>
It's pointing out the good parts of them all. It's a stab at the divisions, 
certainly, in the sub-theme of it, but on the surface, no, it's very genuine. 
It's not cynical. It's saying that a Buddha smile is a beautiful thing to 
have, and 12 Apostles are a beautiful thing, and I'd love to have Aztecs and 
Mayas dancing around my totem pole. I mean, that's all genuine, and perfectly 
artless. It's not meant to be anything at all cynical or jaded. It's a genuine 
response to the beautiful parts of all these beliefs. That part of it was true 
-- I'll take it, I'll take all those things, just leave your wars out of it 
and leave your moralizing out of it and leave your missionaries out of it, but 
give me the Buddha smile.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So you're reveling, then, all the different ways somebody can filter 
things.. .<p></strong>
<blockquote>
Yeah, though the filter is something that I stab at. Religion as an organized 
thing -- I do stab at that.<p>

And "Virtuality" (a song about the Internet) is certainly is a little bit 
sardonic. I'm saying, again using the first person, "I can do this," and "I 
can do that," and the subtext is "no, you can't." You can't hold the world in 
your hand, you can't save the universe in a grain of sand, you can't smell her 
perfume, all these things. The character is operating under an illusion, 
really. Those kind of things I was taking a stab at, at the same time affirming 
the echo, affirming the affirmation among people -- it's nice to go "hello" 
and hear a "hello." And while not discounting that, at the same time I dislike 
when it gets blown up into an illusion.<p>

I'm looking at a big map of Africa on my wall right now, thinking that 
as far as the Internet goes, more than half of Africa doesn't have any kind of 
access to the Internet or the World Wide Web. The virtual reality thing, too -- 
it's not real, you know. You can't dance to a virtual song.<p>

The subtext of it all is this character in kind of blithe naivete saying, "I 
can do this!" and "I can do that!" and "The Internet can do this!" And 
underneath it is the voice of reality going, "No, you can't." You can go have 
fun in the ultimate video game, but you can't hold the universe in your 
hands.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>It's no secret Rush has a big following on the Internet. Was there any 
fear of alienating those fans?<p></strong>

<blockquote>
Well, not fear, because it's not the sort of thing you're supposed to be afraid
of, but certainly I'm aware of it and think it's unfortunate. But, again, if 
you're puncturing illusions. ... It's religion. If you're afraid to poke fun 
at religion because somebody will get offended, then you're gonna run away 
from a lot of subjects in fear. As they say, you're not supposed to talk about 
religion, sex and politics. Well, I like to talk about them all! You're gonna 
offend people. <p>

I see this kind of religious zeal, and "filter" is a well-chosen word you offer
there, in all these cases, because it's not the reality that I'm ever 
criticizing. I happen to love reality. I love the world. It's everything there 
is. But it's the idea that people think they're really connecting, in an 
overblown way like I'm taking a stab at, because it's wrong. The world isn't 
like that. <p>

I always realize it when I travel and I go to some little village in Ghana or 
Sicily and look at all these people living their lives completely oblivious to 
us, and of course all of us living our lives completely oblivious to them. It 
maybe seems facile, but it's not. It's a very deep realization, that all these 
people go through their births and loves and triumphs and tragedies and deaths 
without us even knowing or caring a thing about it. So any kind of global 
consciousness is achieved only by going out there and sweating in these 
villages with these people and drinking their bad water and eating their sandy 
food and understanding a little bit of what their life is like from beginning 
to end, you know. And the idea that you can dial up someone on the computer 
who happens to be another white adolescent male, and have the idea that you're 
connecting with the world ...  well, it's too much. It's just an overblown 
sense of accomplishment.<p>

That's all. I'm poking fun at the hot air, not at the reality, and not at the 
genuineness of the impulse. All those things I'm careful always to glorify, 
but at the same time: Don't overblow the self-importance aspect. I ride herd 
on myself about that all the time, and thus I consider it my duty to ride herd 
on everybody else about it, too.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Do you ever hop on and skim the Rush chat rooms?<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Well, 10 years ago I did, when I was first introduced to it by a guy who worked
at Hewlett-Packard, who took me in and showed me this growing thing. I thought,
"Oh, that's very interesting. Very cool." And even at that time -- 10 years ago,
in the very dawn of the Internet -- there were already <p>
</blockquote>

<strong>I imagine it could drive you nuts after reading it awhile.<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
It would be awfully self-important for me to want to sit down and sift through
The response to it would be either: You'd think you're wonderful, or you'd get 
mad at this kind of invasion and these people with nothing better to do but 
talk about your life and your work.<p>

It's a double-edged sword, as so many things are. It can be very beautiful, and
I have friends who get a lot of use out of it in very productive ways in terms 
of their work and their research, and the actual connections with people and 
libraries and institutes of learning and everything. Those things are very 
valuable, so it's not to be discounted. I'm by no means a Luddite about it. I 
mean, I'm computerized, and CD-ROM-ized, and fax machine-ized, and everything 
else, so I'm hardly a reactionary about it. But at the same time I don't like 
it when things are touted beyond their real meaning.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>But thinking back to "2112," it would be easy for someone to make the 
quick conclusion that maybe you're a little afraid of technology, or the 
possibility that society will be overcome by machines.<p></strong>
<blockquote>

Anger and fear should not be mistaken. I saw "2112" as championing technology. 
My hero in that was reintroducing technology to a non-technological world. 
There are so many shades of meaning in there.<p>

The word "Luddite" is so much bandied about today, but in history the Luddites 
weren't against technology, and they weren't against progress, they were only 
against labor-saving devices -- because they wanted to have jobs. It was as 
simple as that. It wasn't some kind of religious or fanatical wish to destroy 
all machines. They just wanted to make sure people had jobs.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>On to another familiar Peart theme -- time and motion. "Time and 
Motion" is certainly one of the album's top cuts.<p></strong>
<blockquote>
It started from a simple little seed. A friend of mine in a letter once 
remarked, just in an offhand way, that life shouldn't be what you can get out 
of it, but what you can squeeze into it. And I thought that was very profound 
and very insightful, so I developed it into the metaphor of the box cars and a 
train, and you're responsible to load the cargo. This train doesn't pull into 
the station full of stuff for you; you're the one who's supposed to go and 
load the train. I thought that was a very profound and interesting thing. And 
as you point out, it is a common theme of mine -- of self-determination, and 
the power of will, not waiting for things to happen but going out and making 
them happen.<p>

Also response to nature, weather, those are fundamental things for me, the 
worship of essential beauty and the phenomena of nature on a day-to-day basis. 
When people discuss the weather, it's often disparaged -- "oh, we didn't talk 
about anything but the weather" -- but really that's a postmodern comment too. 
Because in our whole history as a species, nothing's been more important than 
weather, more fundamental to our lives and livelihoods. Our hopes for next 
winter, our survival to next summer. All of that was entirely predicated on 
weather for generations and generations, so it's hardly strange that it's the 
most important thing in the world to us. And it remains so to me. But of 
course some of our urban types consider weather to be at worst an intrusion.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Musically the album is very 1996. Like "Counterparts," it's a little 
more raw.<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
It's such a genuine response of us still being music fans, and remaining aware
of the music going on around us, going out and buying CDs and listening to the 
radio and all the stuff that any other music fan does. So of course your time 
and your consciousness is molded by what's going on around you.<p>

I think rock and pop music continue to be really interesting and really 
satisfying, so I stay in touch with them just as a human being, and 
consequently, of course, that does mold your idea of what modern music is.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So, what, does the band just show up at the studio and say, "OK, we're 
gonna make a raw record"?<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
No, we've been working on it for two months at that point, for one thing. 
<em>(Laughs)</em> But we never sit down and discuss those kinds of things. We 
just start work and try to make it as natural and organic as that. Geddy and 
Alex are working away on musical ideas for the first days, whatever gets them 
excited enough to be bothered working on. As for me on the words, too. If I'm 
not interested in it, I'm soon gonna lose the energy and determination that it 
takes to sit there day after day and plug away at it, and throw words away.<p>

All of that is so genuine and so natural, and when we get playing together and 
the songs start to take shape, and the drum part influences the bass part, and 
that influences the guitar part, and I'll take cues from the guitar melody to 
try to build drum parts around that -- it's all so natural. It's almost like a 
slowed-down session of an improvisational session of a three-piece group. We're 
responding to what each other is doing, trying to put forward our own ideas, 
and trying also to create something larger musically than any of those 
elements.<p>

So all of that's going on. Instead of happening spontaneously in the moment, 
it's happening over a slow period. But it's exactly the same organic response 
to each other's playing and the ideas that we've learned and things we want to 
use in the music, the overall sense of structure that we have about it. All 
that just happens so naturally based on what we like and don't like at the 
time, you know. It almost seems too facile to term it that way, but that's 
exactly how it goes. <p>
</blockquote>

<strong>The guitar has a beefed-up role here again.<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Yeah, the last couple of albums we've leaned that way. And they're just genuine
responses to the time.<p>

Our dabblings in keyboards were really a product of the time when that 
technology became available to us, when foot pedals and drum triggers could 
cause so many new sounds. That was really exciting to us, and it also helped 
push back barriers to what a three-piece group could accomplish, especially 
live. So a lot of our experiments were predicated on our time in time, you 
know. When digital synthesizers and sequencers came along, they were tools. 
Electronic drums, the same thing for me -- I couldn't resist. And I do 
continue to use them, but they occupy less focus after a while. They just 
become an article in the tool box that you can bring out when you need it.<p>

I didn't use any electronics on this record, because I didn't need them and 
because I was so focused on drum-set playing. But I'm still using them live 
and I still really love what they can do. So a lot of those things are just 
genuine reflections of the time in which they happen. Our keyboard period 
reflected a time when keyboards were dominant, and it had as much to do wtih 
technology as with style, which I find really interesting too. It wasn't just 
that everybody said, "Let's use a lot of keyboards." It was that people said, 
"Hey, we've built keyboards you can use!" That's an important distinction, but 
nonetheless it was the time in which we were growing and building.<p>

And we used keyboards on this record quite a lot, really, but in more a subtle 
way and more of a supportive role, certainly. Alex has growing confidence in 
what he can accomplish texturally, too. (In the '80s) it was partly wanting to 
expand the limits of a three-piece, so keyboards were an easy way to do that. 
And as Alex has gotten more experience -- and also, guitar technology has 
improved so much -- what he can accomplish, mixing acoustics and different 
guitar textures ... It's his confidence and his ability, too, to play all 
those roles that negate the necessity for keyboards in a lot of those cases.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Did he seem to come in empowered by the solo project he released 
earlier this year?<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Certainly, in the same way I was by my forays into big band music and studying 
with a teacher the last couple of years and practicing every day. I came very 
much empowered by a facility on the drum set I'd never had before in my life. 
Those are life-changing things. For Alex, yes, just to see a project through 
from beginning to end himself ... he does tend to be of a more spontaneous 
nature. It's part of the chemistry among us that he's often the one to come up 
with a brilliant idea just off the top of his head, just to sit down and play 
it, where Geddy and I are more methodical, and any quality we tend to come up 
with is mostly the product of time and effort. Alex can be effortless 
brilliant. (Laughs) <p>

That's a great quality to have, but it makes it hard for him to be applied. For
him to sit down and do a whole project like that was a real challenge, because 
it's just not the way he's made. So, yes, that becomes a very affirming part 
of his life.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So what in the world can a drum teacher teach Neil Peart?<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Well, you never finish learning. And the best comparison, I think, is with 
tennis players. You know, the world's best tennis players have coaches -- what 
can their coaches teach them about the game of tennis? Well, nothing. But they 
can watch them serve, they can watch their cross-court backhand, and say, "You 
know, if you kept your shoulder a little higher, and follow through like 
this ..." So that's what he was for me, very much like a coach -- just watched 
the way I moved and suggested ways in which that could be more natural and 
more comfortable, and hence more musical.<p>

It wasn't ever about teaching me a drum beat or a paradiddle or anything, but 
more on the macroscale, just watching my game and suggesting ways it could be 
better. And sure enough, it could.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Any more solo projects in the works, more stuff like the Buddy Rich 
tribute (released in 1995)?<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Yeah, I'm certainly interested in pursuing that because I enjoyed it so much, 
and also because I have so much music still unreleased on it. I definitely 
plan to do at least one more volume, and possibly two more of it.<p>

I took the opportunity this spring, just after we did the recording, to do an 
instructional video based around the recording of the album, drum part-wise. 
And then right after that I went in and was doing some more work for Volume 
Two of the Buddy Rich thing. I would definitely like to more work personally 
with that, but I would also like to do more with the material I already have.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Is there any one area that's becoming more gratifying at this point 
in life? Are the priorities shifting at all musically?<p></strong>
<blockquote>

Not stylistically, no. It's more work space, I would say, and personal 
enjoyment.<p>

My favorite part of everything is when we go away to the country and work on 
new songs, and we're kind of isolated but we're together, and there's the 
whole collaboration enterprise, which I just love. I love bringing in lyrics 
and having the other guys first of all like them, and then suggest ways to 
make them better, and I go running back to my desk all excited to incorporate 
those improvements. It's just a great time, you know. We're very comfortable 
and friendly together, so we enjoy that time and we produce good work. There's 
a sense of satisfaction of having accomplished and made something out of 
nothing, but at the same time the very process itself on a day-to-day basis is 
really enjoyable, and not nearly as stressful or as fraught with surprises as 
the more public side of it can be.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So is playing live still a high priority?<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
It's less valuable after a while. You know, I realized I spent the last two 
years in my basement basically playing drums for the spiders, and that did me 
more good musically than two years of touring, or five years of touring, would 
ever have done.<p>

There's a point in your building years when there's nothing better you could do
than go out and play every night on a stage, you know, and force yourself to 
that level. We would feel it, as a band, getting better and getting tighter as 
a unit, all of that. But of course once you've achieved that after 20 years, 
you have it! (Laughs) So we don't need to build that anymore.<p>

On the other hand, it's still the ultimate challenge to walk up on a stage with
all the spirit of the moment, when it's not like in the studio where you can 
stop the tape and go back. There's no opportunity to re-do it and refine it -- 
it has to be right on the moment. So that's a tremendous challenge, to walk up 
those stairs every night, especially with 20-odd years behind you, and a 
certain expectation from the audience about how good the performance is 
supposed to be, so that's different too. You're no longer trying to prove 
anything to someone who doesn't know you. You're trying to live up to 
something. So that's a certain level of pressure itself too.<p>

But it is the crucible, I call it. It's the ultimate ordeal by fire.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So there's still nervousness, excitement in those moments before you 
take the stage?<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Oh yeah, man. It's enormous just to walk up that stage every night and deliver.
It's a huge thing, and it's not to be discounted.<p>

But in the past it had an overweening value that was cumulative, that I don't 
really think is there now. ... (As a tour starts) the first few times you 
present it, it's a massive challenge, and then it just becomes a process of 
re-creation, even though it of course changes from night to night, and we've 
tried to make it over the years freer and freer for that eventuality of 
spontaneous magic on the night.<p>

But at the same time you're trying to live up to a certain standard, so it 
takes on a chasing-your-tail kind of aspect.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>As you've gone back through some of these old songs, songs you haven't 
played in some time, are you finding you need to make some real seismic 
shifts in your current performance style?<p></strong>
<blockquote>

From time to time. Again, we're very experimental, and there are limbs we've 
gone out on that we chose not to go out on again! (Laughs) But that's OK, and 
I think it's the right thing to do, and I respect us for doing that. There are 
definitely songs we wouldn't want to revisit.<p>

But the times when we really did hit something, some combination that was just 
right -- and there's no way you can know it at the time -- we can go back and 
find songs that are just as good as they should be. We've learned a lot since 
and improved in subtle ways since, but it's important that all these 
improvements and tools that we acquire are subtle, and very much internal, I 
would say. Even though the shift that I've gone through drumming-wise in the 
last couple of years is not really for the listeners' benefit, except in the 
most subtle and felt way. That's the story through all of it.<p>

We find gems all the time. Last tour when we revived the overture from 
"Hemispheres" from 1978, we hadn't even heard for probably 15 years. And you 
go back, "Hey, it sounds pretty good! And it's great to play!" When you do 
find those, it's a wonderful thing -- something that you do still like and also 
that's enjoyable to play. It's not impossible. That's almost 20 years old and 
we found real pleasure in rediscovering it for ourselves.<p>

At the same time, there are other things from that time or earlier -- or newer,
even songs from the last couple of albums -- that we have no wish to revisit.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So there are musical moments from 20 years ago that make you squirm 
now?<p> </strong>
<blockquote>

Of course! Do you want to see your kindergarten paintings hanging on the 
refrigerator? (Laughs) That's the unfortunate part of it -- so much of your 
growth and development takes place in public. That is tough, to know that 
things you did 23, 24 years ago are still out there in front of people. Of 
course it's embarrassing.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Anything in particular?<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>
Oh, nothing I wish to share with anybody. No, no!<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>How often do you just kick back in your living room and play your old 
records?<p> </strong>
<blockquote>
Never.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>Never?<p></strong>

<blockquote>
Nope. Just before a tour, when we're looking for things, then I'll go through 
and read the titles, really, and think about them and go, "Maybe." And "Maybe 
not."<p>

Over the last couple of months the three of us were sending faxes back and 
forth of potential lists. Some of them were intended to be ridiculous 
suggestions, but even some of those worked out to be -- somebody else took it 
seriously and said, "Well, wait a minute, what if we did this? It could really 
work."<p>

The idea, again, of self-importance -- I would never think of sitting down and 
reading through my press, or listening to my work from that point of view. 
It's just wrong.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>You may not read your own press, but you've certainly got to be aware 
of the revisionist thinking that's come Rush's way in the '90s. Maybe it's a 
younger generation of critics. And others seemed to have stopped to take stock 
and decided they gave you too hard a time two decades ago.<p>
</strong>
<blockquote>

Yes, thank God for that. I am aware of that, certainly, and grateful for it. 
But it was part of a revolution.<p>

Just before that time, in the late '80s, I was concerned for the whole state of
music, even just for drummers. What were drummers doing? There were drum 
machines out there playing these stupid beats all the time, and I wasn't 
hearing, obviously, inventive drumming going on, or any drummer getting an 
opportunity to be inventive or creative, and I really feared for the future of 
the instrument.<p>

And then in the '90s, along comes the whole shift, from Guns N' Roses right 
through the Seattle bands, and suddenly it's all different, it's about real 
musicians playing real instruments again. And suddenly people like us, who 
have championed that, are respected again, instead of being disparaged.<p>

So that was a really pleasant turnaround, not from a personal view so much -- 
although there's nothing wrong with that -- but more on a larger scale. Music 
was an awful lot healthier for that change.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>As you get older, is it...<p></strong>
<blockquote>
I haven't started that process yet! "As time goes on..."<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>OK. As time goes on, is it harder physically to do some of the stuff 
you do? Drumming, particularly yours, is a very physical 
performance.<p></strong>
<blockquote>

It hasn't yet. One of the gifts of maturity, if you like, is stamina. That's 
not a problem. When you see endurance sports, for instance -- marathons and 
triathalons -- older guys do pretty well at that, where the younger ones are 
quickly snapped out.<p>

Fortunately drumming is much more about the long run than it is about 
sprinting. You don't have to give that up. Buddy Rich was almost 70 and still 
playing like a madman. It gives you hope when you see that level of 
performance going on at that age. It certainly doesn't have to stop.<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>So rumors of Rush's demise are definitely premature...?<p></strong>
<blockquote>

That's another unfortunate byproduct of the Internet, that anything anybody 
says suddenly takes on electronic gospel. Part of our frustration is 
constantly having to fight these rumors that blow up on there. My parents get 
phone calls -- "Is it true Neil's dying of cancer?! I saw it on the Internet!" 
So it takes on the wealth of fact.<p>

(Author) Douglas Coupland had an article in the New York Times a few weeks back
saying that he thinks the big problem with the Internet is that it doesn't have
an editor, and he hopes it never does. The title of the article was "Why the 
Internet Should Remain a Mess."<p>

And that's just how it is. But people aren't adjusted to that reality yet, and 
just in the same way that people believe the National Enquirer -- it's in 
print, it must be true -- they still believe what they read on these bulletin 
boards. "If it's in pixels, it must be true."<p>
</blockquote>

<strong>At the same time, would you commit to saying, "Yes, there will be 
another tour?"<p></strong>
<blockquote>

No. I could be dead! Or anything. It's none of anybody's damned business 
anyway! <em>(Laughs)</em><p>

No, like I said, the only thing that's clear in my mind is that as long as 
we're able, we'll continue working together. But everything else is subject to 
reevaluation.<p>

Rush knows how to keep it fresh 
</font><p>
<strong>By Gary Graff</strong>, Journal Music Writer<p>

Together for 27 years, it's clear that the Canadian rock group Rush is no "Fly 
By Night" operation, to cop the title of its second album.<p>

But during the three years leading to the release of its new album, "Test For 
Echo," there were alarmingly constant rumors that the trio was no more.<p>

"It wasn't a concern to me because I was so involved in so many other things," 
says drummer-lyricist Neil Peart, who joined Rush in 1974. "I assumed it would 
come along in due course.<p>

"You just don't worry about those things, really. You say 'O.K., it's time to 
get together and make a record,' so you do."<p>

And what if somebody decides not to answer the call?<p>

"Well, we've never had to deal with that," Peart, 44, says with a chuckle. "I 
don't get too reflective about things like that, especially when life is so 
reflective."<p>

Peart says that Rush's time off, following a shortened tour for its 1993 album 
"Counterparts," was originally intended as a "paternity leave" for 
singer-bassist Geddy Lee. But, the drummer acknowledges, it soon become 
something more.<p>

"It was the first kind of freedom we'd all had," Peart says. "It was an 
important time. It wasn't going away and lulling in a hammock for a year and a 
half in-between tours and albums."<p>

Peart was perhaps the busiest of the three musicians. He took drumming lessons. 
He recorded the first of three intended all-star tribute albums to jazz great 
Buddy Rich. And he published -- privately -- a book about his 1988 bicycle 
trip through West Africa.<p>

Peart says the musical studies were a particularly enjoyable part of his time 
away from Rush. <p>

"For me, it was a period of music development," he says. "I changed almost 
everything about the way I played...so subtly nobody would notice it. It's 
still me playing it, very aggressive, but it's...more about movement, about 
dancing around the drum set, a much more relaxed flow of the rhythm.<p>

"One thing I loved about this period was life was reduced to such a simple 
formula. All I had to do to get better was to practice every day. It's not 
easy, but it's a simple goal."<p>

On the other hand, guitarist Alex Lifeson's extra-band project -- a solo album 
under the moniker Victor -- had greater potential repercussions for Rush. When 
the album was released at the beginning of the year, Lifeson freely told 
interviewers that he had contemplated leaving the group.<p>

Rush was working on "Test For Echo" by the time those comments were published, 
but Peart says he wasn't surprised by them.<p>

"He was coming off the high of doing a solo record and being the big boss," 
Peart explains. "He wasn't sure he wanted to return to being part of the team.<p>

"For me, I like the reward of seeing things improved. Everything is improved 
by going through the process of working on it with the three of us. I think 
Alex felt the same way in the end."<p>

With a sign on the studio door that read "Individually, We Are A Ass/But 
Together, We Are A Genius," Rush recorded "Test For Echo" in a rural Ontario 
studio, not far from Toronto. With blizzards coming and going, the trio 
resumed its usual working arrangement, with Peart writing lyrics he'd then 
turn over to Lee and Lifeson to craft into songs.<p>

"I have a melody in my head," Peart explains, "just to give me something to go 
by, rhythmically. But I don't try to express that to the other guys; it's 
better for them to take in fresh directions, and they often take it in ways 
that are surprising to me. <p>

"The first time I hear a song, it's such a revelation. The words and phrases 
come alive to me in ways I couldn't have anticipated."<p>

For its tour, however, Rush has opted for a fresh direction -- an "evening 
with" approach with an intermission and no opening acts. Peart says that 
format has been considered for awhile, but because Rush benefited from the 
opening spot on several key tours during the '70s, the group "hated to close 
that door" to other bands.<p>

Still, this gives Rush a chance to do away with the song medleys it has taken 
to playing in recent years and to work up songs that have never been played 
live. Peart says that list includes "Natural Science" from the group's 1980 
album "Permanent Waves" as well as the 1976 concept piece "2112," which Rush 
has never played in its entirety.<p>

"In 1976, we were still opening a lot of shows," says Peart. "If we were 
playing a 40-minute set, we didn't want to devote 20 minutes to one song. So 
we had an abridged version of the whole piece...and just because of 
circumstances, that became habit.<p>

"Now we have a chance to correct that. It's been great exchanging lists of old 
songs, ridiculous lists of things that hadn't been played before. It's such a 
fresh format for us...It makes it even more exciting for us to come out and 
play again."<p>
