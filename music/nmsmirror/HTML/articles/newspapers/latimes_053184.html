<font size=+1>Rush slows down the pace at Forum</font><br>
<b>by Duncan Strauss</b><p>

Rush's key asset is its reluctance to crank out frantic, generic heavy metal.
Tuesday night at the Forum, the Canadian trio demonstrated its preference to
bang the head slowly, relying on a more sophisticated approach than your
average riff squad.<p>

This strategy yielded mixed results, suggesting that the band is caught in a
time warp. At times, the trio locked into pulsing, Police-like instrumental
passages. Just as often, with singer-bassist Geddy Lee presiding over an array
of synthesizers, Rush produced some orchestral maneuvers that recalled '70s
progressive rock. Very skillful, very boring.<p>

Over this shifting musical backdrop, Lee narrated the group's obsession with
technology and the future, sprinkling the songs with references to cathode
rays, bytes, modes and humanoids. Perhaps this Ray Bradbury sensibility -- and
the show itself -- would have been more involving if Lee's whiny vocals were
less irritating. Sure, his singing has improved in the last few years, but he
still sounds as though he once inhaled some helium and never quite recovered.<p>

Guitarist Gary Moore opened the show with a solid set of ringing, feisty hard
rock. Moore, who has logged time with such bands as Colosseum II and Thin
Lizzy, immediately won over the partisan audience with his inspired
fret-grinding. Occasionally his playing was a bit heavy-handed, but overall he
displayed a keen melodic sense that's all too rare in this genre.<p>

Rush and Moore also played the Forum on Wednesday, and will perform at Irvine
Meadows Amphitheatre on Saturday night.<p>
