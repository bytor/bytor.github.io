I wasn't expecting much from this CD. The previous Power Windows boot I had
reviewed left a lot to be desired. But this CD is extraordinary, I couldn't
believe my ears! The only bad thing about it is that it's only one disc. The
date should be correct -- Geddy mentions that it's their second night in
Philly, and based on the tour dates listing the 16th was their second night
(please correct me if I'm wrong).<p>

The sound obviously is exceptional. Every instrument clear, precise, and even
in stereo! Even the windchimes come through perfectly. This was recorded
either directly from a master tape, or from a tape that recorded this concert
directly off the radio. The only "glitch" I noticed is a splice during "Red
Sector A", and then I had to listen to it twice, it was done so well. The cut
occurs during the middle section of the song and is hard to spot sound-wise,
but easy to hear if you know what to expect in the song.<p>

Some highlights: listen to the end of "New World Man" to hear Geddy go off;
the version of "Territories" done is amazing; and we can't forget the
ever-present screaming fans, yelling for their favorite song (although I can't
make out what it is). "YYZ" is part of the last track, and is tastefully 
faded out after about a minute.<p>

How come all the best sounding boots have such lousy packaging? This is the
standard insert, no booklet deal. The pictures at least are from the correct
tour, one of each member (Geddy has the honor of gracing the cover). The songs
are also labelled correctly in the correct order.<p>

Honestly I didn't want this CD to end, one of the best I've heard in a long
time! Someone should grab up those tapes and press the whole concert with a
nice booklet to go along with it, and they'd have a real winner on their
hands! Highly recommended.<p>
