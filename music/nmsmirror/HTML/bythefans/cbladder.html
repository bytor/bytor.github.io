<font size=+3>Clinton's Bladder</font><br>
by Mike Sweger<br>
<em>March 10, 1996</em>
<p>

The Prez prepares to rattle<br>
His rhetoric with defiance.<br>
Hushed and fickle newsmen<br>
Have the White House press room crowded<br>
Feeling quite incontenent<br>
The pressure starts to climb<br>
From five cups of coffee<br>
And a glass of ripple wine...<p>

All at once,<br>
  his zipper's parted.<br>
Piss flows down<br>
  in wet and golden streams...<p>

Follow their eyes<br>
  as they look at his fly.<br>
The spreading stains of wetness<br>
  make the pollsters cry and scream...<p>
