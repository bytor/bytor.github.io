A SHOW OF HANDS<br>

<strong>
THE DRUMMER SOUNDS OFF
</strong><br>
<em>
(not <strong>him</strong> again!)
</em><p>

 Yes, it's that time once more.  A new live album, <strong>A Show Of 
Hands</strong>, is
probably being released as you read this, or maybe a long time ago, or maybe
not yet.  But anyway, it's finished.<p>
 Choosing the material was difficult.  We didn't want to use anything that
had appeared on previous albums, with the exception of "Closer to the Heart",
as it had that snappy "improv" bit at the end that we liked, so we decided to
put it on.  Other than that, all the material is from <strong>Signals</strong> on, except
for "Witch Hunt", which hadn't been recorded for a live album previously.<p>
 Most of the performances came from the <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> tour, many of them
recorded in Birmingham England during our European tour in April, with others
recorded in New Orleans, Phoenix and San Diego.  "Mystic Rhythms" and "Witch
Hunt" were recorded at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, during the <strong>Power
Windows</strong> tour.<p>

 The CD giveth and the CD taketh away.<p>
 While the growing popularity of CDs and cassettes allowed us to make <strong>Hold
Your Fire</strong> a little longer than a record likes to be, this time we were in
the quandary of making a double-record set that we wanted to fit on one CD,
so you, the hard-pressed consumer, wouldn't be obliged to shell out for 
<strong>two</strong>
CDs.  So we had to keep the time down to around 74 minutes, and had to be
fairly selective about the songs we included.  There are some we had to leave
off which we would like to have included, and no doubt some of you will be
disappointed not to find one or two you would have liked too, but we had to
be ruthless.  (And now we have no more ruths.)<p>
 The approach to sound was a difficult balance too.  In retrospect we always
felt that <strong>All The World's A Stage</strong> was a little too raw, and 
that <strong>Exit
Stage Left</strong> was a little too refined, so we were trying to find the right
balance somewhere in between.  We're pleased with what we've got, and hope
you will be too.  We wanted it to sound <strong>good</strong>, but we wanted 
it to sound
<strong>live</strong> too, and it's difficult to find the right meeting point sometimes.<p>
 There will also be a concert video to accompany this album, which Geddy is
working on right now (I weaseled out of that job!).  It was filmed during two
of the Birmingham UK shows, and by all reports is going to turn out very
well.  Of course, that's another aspect of the live show that's very
difficult to capture and reproduce; the <strong>visual</strong> performance.  Really, it's
impossible to record <strong>or</strong> film a live show in the way that either the
musicians or the individual members of the audience experienced it, but again
it requires a subtle blending of those varying, and sometimes diametrical,
points of view.  We can only try.<p>

 Here and now, in September 1988, we have just finished a summer of rest and
recuperation from the <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong> tour, which ended in Europe at the
beginning of May.  The tour began the previous October, and so stretched over
about seven months, and it was a difficult one for us.  The pressure of the
performances, the musical and technological challenges, and the scheduling
were all very demanding, and we finished up tired, but very proud of the
quality of the shows we were able to produce, and satisfied with a good tour.
<p>
 Sometime in 1989 we will start work on a new studio album, and each of us is
already at work on ideas for that project.  But at the same time we're
enjoying the luxury of a little more time than we usually take, time to
become reacquainted with life, and explore some of its other interesting
avenues.  In our fourteen years together we have never lived a second without
a deadline hanging over us, whether five minutes, a month, or six months
away, and for once we haven't got any <strong>external</strong> pressure on us, so we're
going to enjoy it for a little while.<p>
 We <strong>deserve</strong> it!<p>
 (And yes -- so do you.)<p>
<hr><p>

 So that's enough about boring old <strong>us</strong>, lets turn to the 
latest bunch of questions <strong>you've</strong> sent in, and I'll try to 
answer them for you:
<p>

<strong>Q-</strong> We got hold of a concert tape from Cleveland in 1974.  It has two songs
that surprised us.  The first was "Bad Boy".  The second was (I'll call it)
"Peace of Mind".  We would like to know why these were never produced on an
album and if they were originally from Rush.<br>

Tim Greathouse<br>

<dl> <dd>

 <strong>A-</strong> You "got hold of"?<br>
 You mean, you abrogated our rights, circumvented protective copyrights,
violated international statutes, and supported piracy by buying a bootleg
album, don't you?<p>
 Ah- I thought so.  Never mind.<p>
 "Bad Boy" is an old song, written by somebody whose name fails to leap to
mind, and a funky Toronto arrangement of it was played during our first tour.<p>
 The other one mystifies me.  I don't possess that recording (not wanting to
commit the moral outrages listed above), but it might have been either "Fancy
Dancer" or "Garden Road", two original songs written before I joined the
band, which we played on that tour but never recorded.<p>
 Well, why do you <strong>think</strong> we never recorded them?
</dd></dl><p>

 <strong>Q-</strong> Can you tell me the name of the album by Jeff Berlin that Neil plays on?<br>
<font size=-1>
Doug Trompak<br>
Bull Shoals, AR</font><p>
<dl>
<dd>

 <strong>A-</strong> Yes I can.  It's called <strong>Champions</strong>.
</dd></dl><p>

 <strong>Q-</strong> (a) What movie clip is shown before your performance of "Lock and Key"?<br>
(b) At the end of "Cygnus X-1" on album and cassette there is a heartbeat,
but not on CD.  Why?<br>
(c) Who "stars" in "The Body Electric" video?<br>
(d) Is drumming as painful as Neil makes it look?<br>
(e) How did "Mystic Rhythms" get to be the theme song for NBC's "1986"?<br>
(f) What inspired the lyrics of "Lock and Key".<br>
<font size=-1>
Laura Cremeans<br>
Providence, RI</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> (a) <strong>The Last Mile</strong>.<br>
(b) Don't know.  Somebody must have goofed.<br>
(c) Ah -- <strong>me?</strong>  No, just kidding.  Actually I don't know.  Some English actor.<br>
(d) Yes.<br>
(e) They asked us.  We said yes.<br>
(f) Bad people and what to do about them.
</dd></dl><p>

 <strong>Q-</strong> (a) What is the basic theme of "Force Ten".<br>
(b) What is the significance of the album cover design, and who is the man
juggling the fireballs in the photo?<br>
(c) What is the meaning and basic theme of "Tai Shan"?<br>
(d) Is the flute used in the beginning of "Tai Shan" a Hakumachi flute, or is
it a synthesized sound?<br>
(e) Why has Geddy switched back to the Wal bass?<br>
(f) What is Lerxst?<br>
(g) Who or what is Jack Secret?<br>
(h) What keyboard parts are played by Andy Richards and why didn't Geddy do
them instead?<br>
<font size=-1>
Brady Darvin<br>
Annandale, VA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> (a) I wish I knew.<br>
(b) No real significance at all.  We began with the idea which appears on the
inner sleeve, then decided it would be graphically interesting to simplify it
down to the image which appears on the cover, and let the full image be
revealed in a secondary manner.  Reverse reduction.  The juggler -- the
"fire-holder" -- is a character actor who appears in several films, notably
<strong>Tin Men</strong>.<br>
(c) I wish you knew.<br>
(d) It's a sampled Shakuhachi flute.<br>
(e) Hmm...  Must be he likes it.<br>
(f) I wish I knew.<br>
(g) He wishes he knew.<br>
(h) Andy Richards is a London session keyboard player, who has done a lot of
great work, especially on the records produced by Trevor Horn.  We brought
him in to work on <strong>Power Windows</strong>, and then again on 
<strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>, mainly
to contribute more inventive keyboard sounds for already established parts,
and additional "special effects" keyboard bits.  Little "sound events" to
spice up the tracks.  He's a specialist.

 <strong>Q-</strong> Rhythm and bar-interchanges are of fundamental interest to the music of
Rush.  How close are you as drummer/percussionist involved with the
composition of your songs?<br>
<font size=-1>
Alex van Loon<br>
Holland</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> Good question, Alex.  My involvement varies, but is usually restricted to
the <strong>arrangement</strong> side of things.  Geddy and the 
<strong>other</strong> Alex do all of the
real composition, but I may sometimes contribute rhythmic or arrangement
suggestions, or offer comments on the strength or weakness of different
sections.  And of course, the lyrics play a subtle part in the outcome of the
music, and if they are written first they will often influence the mood,
framework and character of the song.
</dd></dl><p>

 <strong>Q-</strong> (a) It seems your most popular hits are always the first song on an
album.  Is there any certain order that you go by when putting songs on an
album?<br>
(b) I know that you like your songs to do the explaining for you but I just
can't figure out what "The Trees" is about.  Could you give me just a short
explanation?<br>
(c) What is a glockenspiel?<br>
<font size=-1>
Clay Gilchrist<br>
Rome, GA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> (a) Always an interesting problem.  It's not something we decide until
very late in the recording and mixing process, once we have a sense of the
"color" of each track.  Then Alex constructs the "Omega
Album-Order-Deciding-Device", which allows each title to be moved around, to
see how different song orders "look".  Then we argue about it, hit each other
in the face with a glove, challenge each other to a duel, and whoever
survives picks the order.<br>
(b) It's an allegorical metaphor on human behavior.  (You asked!)<br>
(c) A glockenspiel is a keyboard percussion instrument, like a xylophone,
with metal bars as keys.

 <strong>Q-</strong> I have read references to two unreleased Rush songs: "Sir Gawain and the
Green Knight" (from <strong>Success Under Pressure</strong> by Steve Gett) 
and "Tough Break"
(from <strong>Stories from Signals</strong> by Neil Peart). a- Will these 
songs ever be released?  b- How can I hear or obtain copies of them?<br>
<font size=-1>
Mike Poole<br>
Medway, MA</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> (a) Not likely.<br>
(b) You can't.
</dd></dl><P>

 <strong>Q-</strong> (a) Does Neil play a synthesized marimba on "Mission"?
<br>
(b) Will Peter Collins most likely produce another Rush album in the future?<br>
<font size=-1>
Stephen E. Moore<br>
Circleville, OH</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> (a) Yes, it's the KAT mini-marimba playing a marimba 
sample in the AKAI S-900 sampler.<br>
(b) We haven't really discussed that as yet, but it's entirely possible.  We
enjoyed working with him, and we feel he is good for our music.

 <strong>Q-</strong> I have recently obtained a copy of a German album entitled "Rush Through
Time", released on the Mercury label in 1981.  I've heard of a limited
edition album called "Rushian Roulette", but have never actually seen it.  Do
you know of this or any other foreign, or little-known albums that have been
released by the band, and if so, where they might be purchased?<br>
<font size=-1>
Adam Leighton<br>
Storrs, CT</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> There is <strong>no</strong> material which we have 
released which is not on our
"regular" albums, except perhaps for a couple of live versions of previously
released songs which appeared on the "B" sides of our hugely successful hit
singles.  I don't know about the second title you mention, but the first was
released by the German company entirely without our knowledge or consent (not
that they <strong>need</strong> it), and certainly contains nothing of any 
interest -- not even the cover, and <strong>certainly</strong> not that 
title.  We wouldn't do that.  Have you noticed that <strong>everyone</strong> 
puns with our name <strong>except</strong> us?  (Whoops, I'm
supposed to be <strong>answering</strong> the questions around here.)
</dd></dl><p>

 <strong>Q-</strong> (a) In concert why does Geddy sing: "Hey Cookie, it's a quarter to 8",
instead of "Hey Baby it's a quarter to 8"?<br>
(b) Who came up with the idea of playing the "Three Stooges" theme song
before you come out on stage?<br>
(c) Do you think you'll ever play the full version of <strong>2112</strong> 
or <strong>Hemispheres</strong>
in concert?<br>
<font size=-1>
Brian Bresnahan<br>
St. Louis, MO</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> (a) It's a secret.<br>
(b) It's a secret.<br>
(c) It's no secret.  No.  You can't go back.
</dd></dl><p>

 <strong>Q-</strong> I would like to know why you wrote the words "to mold a 
new reality".
 How is it possible to mold a new reality?  It does not seem possible because
reality just is and there could not be another reality.<br>
<font size=-1>
Brandon Lee Gordon<br>
Northport, NY</font><P>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> So -- there's an Existentialist in the house.  I'll call the
Existerminator.<p>
"No problem sir, we just give those guys a big shot of Logical Positivism,
and they're as good as new."<p>
That's a relief.<p>
I disagree with you, Brandon.  There's a new reality born every minute.
 (P.T. Barnum?  No, he said the other thing.)  Unless one is a believer in
predestination (in which case I'll call the prestidigitator), or other
puppet-like restraints on our powers, one is free to imagine and effect
changes on the world.  And if enough people do it, there are big changes.<p>
 These things happen.  Anything can.
</dd></dl><P>

<strong> Q-</strong> (a) Is there any possible way to obtain a "backstage pass" to a Rush
concert when it plays in my town?  If so, how, and if you are unsure, where
could I find out about this?<br>
(b) Where could I purchase a copy of the song "Battlescar"?<br>
<font size=-1>
James Robinson<br>
Fort Worth, TX</font><p>

<dl><dd>
 <strong>A-</strong> (a) DON'T <strong>ANYBODY</strong> EVER ASK THIS 
QUESTION AGAIN.  THERE IS <strong>NO</strong> POSSIBLE WAY.  NONE!<br>
(b) (That's okay, I'm better now.)  "Battlescar" was recorded for a Max
Webster album, I forget which one right now, and I'm not sure if it's
available in the US.  If not, perhaps an import shop could acquire it for
you.
