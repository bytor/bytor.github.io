<em>November 9, 1993</em>
<p>

What would you rather watch?<br>
Anything but this<br>
When will the time be right?<br>
Only late at night<p>

On the edge of sleep<br>
I was clicking for half the night<br>
O'Brien and Leno<br>
Chase and Arsenio<br>
American Gladiators fight (they fight!)<br>
So many decisions on my television<br>
What to watch until morning light<p>

Plethora of channels<br>
Even more with cable<br>
The clicking makes me tired<br>
Though my aim's still stable<br>
I flip between the channels<br>
Home Shopping Club's selling sable<p>

What would you rather watch?<br>
Anything but this<br>
When will the time be right?<br>
Only late at night<br>
If I don't find something soon<br>
It will be afternoon<br>
Anything but this<p>

On the edge of sleep<br>
I found sanctitude on CBS<br>
Not the shopping club selling<br>
But Larry "Bud" Melman<br>
Dave Letterman's always been best (been best!)<br>
Who the guests will be doesn't matter to me<br>
"Late Show" still passes the test<p>

Plethora of channels<br>
To choose from late at night<br>
There can only be one choice<br>
Since David left "Late Night"<br>
I settle in my armchair --<br>
Though fall asleep I might...<p>

On the edge of sleep, I greatly enjoy the Top Ten<br>
Laughing and smiling, out of breath and near dying<br>
I knew what to watch in the end (the end!)<br>
The choice has been made, now he's getting paid<br>
Late night's king is Dave Letterman<p>
