He's got a picture of UFOs,<br>
Alien invaders from Mars,<br>
Landing by the freeway.<br>
She's got a tape recorder taping,<br>
Catching every word<br>
These little green guys say.<p>

We travel like a big pack of wild dogs<br>
Scraping up whatever dirt we can find or create<br>
Like Phil and Geraldo<br>
And the others seen from state to state<br>
But we keep up by finding Bigfoot's mate.<br>
Bigfoot's mate.<p>

He has to call back his editor<br>
From a cheap motel<br>
Not far from the freeway.<br>
She gets kidnapped by the Martians<br>
Taken to another world<br>
For further analysis.<p>

We travel on the road to Graceland<br>
A highway packed with mobile homes and Winnebagoes<br>
Like Sally and Oprah<br>
Listening to guys named Moe<br>
Saying Elvis now lives in Ohio.<br>
Ohio.<p>

We are dumb<br>
Travelling the face of the Earth,<br>
Looking for that small bit of dirt<br>
About Michael Jackson or Madonna<br>
Or Michael Landon's ghost.<br>
We are scum.<br>
Making up stuff about the stars<br>
Driving little cheapo cars<br>
Wishing that we wouldn't have gotten<br>
A mail order degree.<p>

Time to smear a famous movie star<br>
Run him through the muck, after crashing his new car.<br>
Drinking, drugs, violence, and sex tapes<br>
Used to ruin people's lives<br>
For the sake of a few bucks.<p>

We fabricate as much as we can<br>
'Cause we have no scruples, morals, or ethical sense.<br>
Like the "Globe" and "Enquirer"<br>
We like throwing mud a presidents.<br>
It's easy money when people are so dense.<br>
Are so dense.<p>

Here we come<br>
Hiding in bushes and trees<br>
Acting like ultimate sleeze<br>
Taking pictures of people and doctoring film.<br>
You can't run.<br>
We know where you might hide.<br>
We have no sense of pride.<br>
Journalistic integrity is thrown out the door.<br>
When we are done,<br>
You'll wish you would just die.<br>
Our never-blinking eye<br>
Will continue to make your life<br>
Into a living hell.<p>

"Elvis Seen in Dayton, Ohio"<br>
And other headlines designed to grab your last two bucks<br>
Like Maury and Geraldo<br>
We keep going only by total luck<br>
Those who believe us are total schmucks<br>
Total schmucks.<p>
</body>
