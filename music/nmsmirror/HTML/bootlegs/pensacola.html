Although the sound on this one gets off to a shaky start, it quickly smooths
out into a great audience-quality show. And when I say audience, I mean
audience -- all those annoying, drunk fans that think they know the words and
know how to sing, and will make sure that you know they know, preferrably at
the top of their lungs are here for your listening pleasure. The concert 
itself sounds great, just what you'd hear if you were there at the show. The
drums are very sharp<p>

You call this packaging?? The double-cd is in a "digi-pak", an ecologically
correct jewel box made of cardboard. Which means no booklet, although some may
consider that a bonus. And what's with the picture of shrivelled feet on the
back? One extra is the picture on the cover itself -- I don't know where this
picture of Geddy was taken, or even if it ever appeared in a magazine, so it
seems very unique.<p>

The encore (track 7) is not listed on the back of the cd, and several people
have commented that their cd doesn't contain this track; there may possibly be
two versions of this show. Xanadu is also missing from the listing, and The
Pass is listed as The Task.<p>

Overall, not a bad concert to have on cd. It does contain the whole show with
nothing edited out, and is quite a good audience recording. If you don't mind
the digi-paks, it's worth the money.<p>
