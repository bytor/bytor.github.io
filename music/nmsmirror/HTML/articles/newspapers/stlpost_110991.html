<font size=+1>Rush melds showmanship, great music</font><br>
<b>by Louise King</b><p>

ANYONE fortunate enough to have seen Rush live can attest to
the fact that the Canadian hard-rock trio's concerts are more than a
musical happening; they're an audio and visual event that assaults
the senses from all sides. <p>

And based on the band's performance at The Arena Thursday
night, it appears Rush has been able to maintain the spectacular
nature of its stage show through the years without taking anything
away from its thoughtful, intelligent, highly developed musical
compositions. <p>

While some of the stunts and some of the video clips were
repeated from concerts past, the new visual effects were numerous
enough to hold the audience's attention. <p>

Chief among these were the videos displayed during the playing of
the funky title song from the group's latest disc, "Roll The
Bones." The images of skeletons, rolling dice and playing
enhanced the lyrical message of this tune and indeed the entire new
release - that no matter how well prepared we are, life is a crap
shoot, and the only way we can improve the odds is by the
choices we make. <p>

The group also made points with its choice of material - a fine mix
of vintage Rush and newer tunes. Lengthy instrumentals
accompanied by dizzying laser light displays were balanced with
synthesizer-enhanced, polyrhythmic pieces. <p>

Vocalist/bassist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson did a
phenomenal job playing off one another, but drummer Neil Peart
really stole the show. He displayed his prowess on electronic
drum pads, then switched to a more conventional set of skins.
Finally, he augmented his drumming with digitally sampled
sounds. <p>

Guitar wunderkind Eric Johnson was the opening act. His
dexterous fingering and almost magical ability to achieve
otherworldly tones by bending notes as far as they will go puts
him in a class by himself. Like a jazz musician, he frequently
strays from the main theme of his compositions, taking us on new
and exciting adventures before returning to the familiar melody. <p>

The highlight of the 40-minute set was Johnson's lengthy
introduction to "Cliffs of Dover," which is not heard on the radio
version of the tune. <p>
