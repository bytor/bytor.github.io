<font size=+1>Rush: trio rolled the dice and came up a winner</font><br>
<b>by Roger Catlin</b><p>

PLENTY of bands are sitting out the recession. But Rush, which
will be at Riverport at 8 p.m. June 12, gambled - and won. The
Canadian rock trio is filling arenas while many other shows are
languishing on the road. <p>

Rush forged an ever-evolving sound on its new album, "Roll the
Bones," taking a chance when other bands stayed put. <p>

Providence played a prominent role, although drummer and
lyricist Neil Peart says it wasn't planned that way. <p>

"The idea of chance and randomness on the album came out of
one incidental image - the wild card. I thought of that image more
and more: how randomness affects us as a band, and people at
large. There are so many different areas. <p>

"There are things for which there is no explanation," Peart says.
The only answer I can come up with is: It happens because it
happens. And if things occur, what can we do about them?" <p>

Peart tried to answer these questions in his lyrics. "That's what
kept driving me deeper and deeper," he says. "These are the kind
of intellectual questions I throw around with my friends, one of
whom said, 'Because they happen sounds like something my dad
would say.' I'm not trying to diffuse the question. But I wanted to
avoid being pretentious." <p>

Things on earth, he says, are "not futile but random." <p>

To come to any conclusion, or to decide on song lyrics, "I had to
juggle everything to see if I could say anything. <p>

"I readily confess to being didactic sometimes and not expressing
myself as clearly as I should," Peart says. "But one time Geddy
(Lee, the band's lead vocalist) pointed out to me that I was just
giving my idea, saying what I thought, and asking, 'What do you
think?' I'm not saying something is black or white. I'm just
saying, 'Maybe this is something you'd like to think about.' " <p>
