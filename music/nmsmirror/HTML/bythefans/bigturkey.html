Big turkey can feed half the world<br>
Big turkey and some yams<br>
Big turkey takes all day to cook<br>
Big turkey beats a ham<br>
Big turkey has a crisp brown skin<br>
Big turkey and stuffing<br>
Big turkey got a yummy taste<br>
Big turkey got a little poppy thing<p>
<dl><dd>

  Sometimes passing stuffing around<br>
  Sometimes carving up the bird<br>
  Sometimes eating cranberry sauce<br>
  Sometimes gravy must be stirred<br>
  It's the feathers and the glory<br>
  It's a war in the coop<br>
  It's a turkey story<br>
  On a pile of turkey poop<p>
</dd></dl>

Big turkey can feed half the world<br>
Big turkey taste real good<br>
Big turkey, he can kick your ass<br>
Big turkey from the 'hood<br>
Big turkey got a mighty beak<br>
Big turkey has big thighs<br>
Big turkey makes a damn fine roast<br>
Big turkey got no eyes<p>
<dl><dd>

  Sometimes watching Macy's parade<br>
  Sometimes watching a first down<br>
  Sometimes building you a freeway<br>
  To transport the turkey on<br>
  It's really quite a vision<br>
  It's something kind of quirky<br>
  It's the fool on television<br>
  Getting played to dress like a turkey<p>
</dd></dl>

Big turkey can feed half the world<br>
Big turkey will get eat<br>
Big turkey got a million feathers<br>
Big turkey can't be beat<br>
Big turkey got a hefty leg<br>
Big turkey cooked by mom<br>
Big turkey gonna be your feast<br>
Big turkey's name is Tom<p>
