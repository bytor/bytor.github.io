<font size=+1>Veteran rockers Rush still have imagination</font><br>
<b>by Ralph Kisiel</b><p>

Not only can Rush still roll the bones, but the hard-rocking Canadian trio 
showed a Savage Hall audience Saturday night that they still can do it with 
intensity and imagination.<p>

"Being mature doesn't have to mean being dead," Rush drummer Neil Peart says. 
"You just have to get out there and rock, keep your bones rolling, and stay 
out of the ruts."<p>

So the trio named their latest and 18th album "Roll the Bones" and set out on 
a year-long concert tour. They clearly illustrated Saturday night that they 
can rock and rattle your bones for more than two hours.<p>

The 19-song set left their fans thoroughly satisfied, as they exhibited the 
precision, controlled power, and polish that only a veteran band can provide 
with such ease. The fan response was overwhelming as most in the boisterous 
crowd were on their feet for nearly the entire show.<p>

Rush used crowd favorites like "Limelight" and "Freewill" to whip up the 
audience's emotions quickly. But the band offered much more through the 
effective, often intriguing use of film clips cast on a huge screen behind 
them. As the house lights dimmed, the screen came to life with delightful 
Picasso-styled cartoon characters that represented the band members preparing 
for the show. Most songs were accompanied by film, hypnotic geometrical 
designs, or clever animation.<p>

"It's been quite a few years since we've been here in Toledo, so let's get 
right into it," said Geddy Lee, the band's singer, bass guitarist, and keyboard 
player. Although Rush is a trio, Lee really acts as the band's third and 
fourth musician, displaying his versatility by frequently switching between 
bass and synthesizer during the same song.<p>

None of the musicians really offered much in the way of between-song banter, 
but with all of the visual attractions, including stunning laser lights, 
friendly chatter really wasn't missed.<p>

During "Time Stand Still," the crowd was treated to a dizzying high-speed
ride over snow-capped mountains, through narrow tree-filled valleys, and
just feet above a twisting river. The rollicking trip was accomplished via 
an aerial movie projected at super speed.<p>

"Dreamline," "Roll the Bones," and "Bravado" were offered from the new album, 
with lead guitarist Alex Lifeson presenting a haunting, dreamy passage on 
"Bravado" - a highlight of the show.<p>

Lifeson's scorching guitar work on "Superconductor" was accompanied by two 
25-foot-tall inflatable rabbits slowly rising from gargantuan black hats 
on each side of the stage. While his guitar riffs crashed through the hall, 
the bunnies bounced merrily to the vicious beat.<p>

Rush's variety-packed show included "Closer to the Heart," "Tom Sawyer,"
"The Big Money," and "The Spirit of Radio."
