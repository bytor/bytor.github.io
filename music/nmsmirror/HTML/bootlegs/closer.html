<p>
Unlike most of the Counterparts boots, this is only one cd. The sound is 
better than most of them, however, and is not bad if you're only looking 
for the first half of the concert.<p>

The sound itself is a decent audience recording. The guitar is very present,
as are the cymbals, the bass is very muddy and is difficult to pick out, the 
vocals are fairly easy to understand, but the high end does seem to get clipped
in some parts.  The crowd is only occasionally annoying with a talker or 
screamer near the mic.<p>

The packaging is a standard two-page fold-out booklet, but has some nice
shots from the Counterparts tour, as does the back. The date and venue are
listed (and confirmed by Geddy as he mentions this is their "second night"
at the Garden), and all the songs are correctly listed and in the correct 
order.<p>

With the Counterparts soundboards out there, this is one to leave
alone (especially considering it's only HALF the concert). It's a nice
show to have on cd, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.
