Ooh, there's no bread<br>
No more cake<br>
Cannot end<br>
This stomache ache<br>
All these bills are coming in<br>
Play the lottery - as if I'll win!<p>

So, I'm waiting for next payday<br>
The washing machine keeps eating all my ties<br>
The fridge is frozen at 60 degrees<br>
And I'm sick of eating these rancid pot pies<p>

Ooh, I've got no more blood to give<br>
Had to sell my baby's crib<br>
The landlord says he's gonna sue!<br>
May I have that pop can when you're through?<p>

Oh, I'm waiting for next payday<br>
The doctor says I've got a case of Reye's<br>
Hard to drive with just 3 tires<br>
And I see the dog through very hungry eyes<p>

One more week<br>
Until I'm paid<br>
Then I'll buy a can of Raid<br>
Next I'll eat a hearty meal<br>
And give Grandma a proper burial<p>

Oh, I'm longing for next payday<br>
Car insurance - always on the rise<br>
Boss man will not hear my pleas<br>
Need some cash before one of us dies<p>
