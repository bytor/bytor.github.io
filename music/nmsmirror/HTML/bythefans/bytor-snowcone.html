Outside the video arcade<br>
Looking for more quarters<br>
My best friend By-Tor is a geek<br>
A real snot-snorter<p>

I see him approach me with something icy cold<br>
A summer snack, crunchy, fruity and bold!<p>

By-Tor and his Snow Cone!<br>
If I walked away right now, they'd be each other's friend!<p>

Across the parking lot I amble really fast<br>
Because I just figured out By-Tor has gas<br>
But I turn around to see him striking a mean pose<br>
His Snow Cone attacks and ices him in the nose<p>

By-Tor and his Snow Cone!<br>
Square for battle -- let the fray begin!!<p>

[imagine lots of horrid battle music here, with Neil on kazoo
representing By-Tor and Geddy's distorted Rick representing the Snow Cone]

Snow Cone is victorious!<br>
No more geeks in the arcade<br>
Let's go ba-ack!<p>
