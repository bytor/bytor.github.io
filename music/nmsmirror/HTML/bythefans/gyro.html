<em>July 7, 1994</em>

I knew it was different in its nationality<br>
I went to its restaurant as the straight minority<br>
It never seemed a threat to my love for ham and cheese<br>
It only introduced me to a wider reality<p>

As the hours went by, we drifted apart<br>
When I heard that it was gone<br>
I felt a shadow cross my heart<br>
But it's nobody's---<p>

Gyro--saves a starving child<br>
Cures a wasting disease<br>
Gyro--feeds the hungry masses<br>
Add more lettuce please!<p>

Gyro--just some lamb and veggies<br>
In a pita roll<br>
Gyro  better than a grilled cheese<br>
You can go get your own<br>
If anybody's buying<br>
Nobody's gyro<p>
