<p>

Brachiosaurus calling while they eat the trees<br>
Dinosaurs, wheezing and about to sneeze<br>
A thousand gillimimus, running down the hill<br>
Tyrannosaurus Rex, will catch his meal<p>

Jurassic Park, dinos in the movies<br>
Jurassic Park, so many salaries<br>
merchandise, endorsement rights,<br>
box office returns are out of sight<p>

Dazed by the island, beauty from another age<br>
Lots of guarded secrets, this will be the rage<br>
Experimenting with DNA, cloning without fear<br>
Scientists should leave extinct species in yesteryear.<p>

Everyone would gather for two hours everyday<br>
Sitting in the dark to watch the dinos on display.<br>
Scary scenes on the screen, people who are in danger<br>
Careless use of technology will always lead to disaster.<p>
