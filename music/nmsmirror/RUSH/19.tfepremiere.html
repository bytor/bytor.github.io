<p>
There is no RealAudio server running on syrinx, so you must download the
entire file for it to play. You still must use the RealAudio player to hear
them (I will be redoing these files WITHOUT the songs in the next few days).
If you don't have a RealAudio player, go to the 
<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.realaudio.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.realaudio.com/'" tppabs="http://www.realaudio.com/">RealAudio web site</a> and download the 
player for free!<br>
<em>Please do not ask me to put these up for ftp download, or convert them
to a different format. I cannot do either at this time!<p></em>
