So what is it about Rush?<p>

On Friday night, their fans filled the Marcus Amphitheater to
three-quarters capacity to see the veteran Canadian power trio.
Most of those who showed were probably in junior high when the
band's album epics "2112" and "Farewell to Kings" were first
released.<p>

Their loyalty to Rush probably can be attributed to the fact that
the band over the years has managed to create an insular world for
itself. One that was and still is oblivious to the fact that they
will never be fashionable to critics or to the popular kids in
high school.<p>

For the Rush-obsessed fans who showed Friday night, this world was
a spectacle to behold.<p>

The band came out to a stage set that was stripped down compared
to their setups of years past, when singer, bassist and keyboard
player Geddy Lee would stand behind banks and banks of synths,
dazzling the audience with his multi-instrumental prowess.
Instead, there were kitschy retro props, old TV towers that fit in
with the theme of their latest album release, "Test For Echo";
high-tech laser satellite dishes; and a wide-screen television
that alternately flashed trendy, Gen-X video fodder and close-up
shots of the band.<p>

The show leaned heavily on material from "Test For Echo." Like
virtually everything else they've written, the album is a
continuation of lyricist and drummer Neil Peart's didactic
warnings of how technology will destroy the individual.<p>

Lee and guitarist Alex Liefson did show flashes of humor during
the show - in stark contrast to the utter humorlessness of their
music - especially when Liefson was experiencing prolonged
technical difficulties with his guitar. For a moment, even Peart
looked like he was having fun, but after the problem was fixed,
they launched into "Driven" from their new album. Lee and the
audience put all jocularity aside to sing the lines, "The road
unwinds toward me/What was there is gone/The road unwinds before
me/And I go riding on," with deadly seriousness.<p>

A warm feeling did come over the crowd when the band pulled out
the old chestnuts "Red Barchetta," "Closer to the Heart," and
specially the entire "2112" suite. This last is pure Rush - songs
about how the individual can triumph through music, as fans
fervently and faithfully air-guitar and -drum every note, hitch
and belch of the "2112 Overture."<p>

At the suite's climax, complete with the predictable flashing
colored lights, the crowd cheered in triumph when the "2112" red
star logo flashed on the giant TV screen. Which begs the question:
Hadn't anyone noticed, as they were singing along with such fervor
to "Temples of Syrinx" that the red star was a symbol of those who
were trying to oppress the song's hero?<p>
