Rush covers 20 year career in 3-hour show
</font><p>
<strong>By Bryan Murray</strong>, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer<p>

  Rush is a testament to endurance, a marathon runner among sprinters.  They
have been together for more than 20 years, and as many albums.  Always
reinventing themselves, they have never stayed still long enough to stagnate.<p>
  Sunday night -- without an MTV video, or a number-one selling album -- Rush
sold more than 13,000 tickets at the Coral Sky Amphitheater as they toured
behind their new album, <strong>Test for Echo</strong>.<p>
  Billed as "An Evening with Rush", the new tour features the band playing a
three hour-plus concert complete with intermission.<p>
  Rush started the show by choosing songs randomly from their huge catalog,
playing "Big Money", then jumping ahead to play "Driven", a cut from their new
album, and then back to "Red Barchetta".  There is little pretense with Rush,
no attitude-of-the-moment or trendy looks, just a focus on music.  But they
aren't above poking fun at themselves, whether it was ending "Big Money" with a
few seconds of "Wipe Out", or placing mannequins of the Three Stooges on stage.
<p>
  The band's playing was tight, and Geddy Lee's voice was strong throughout,
even during some of the older, more vocally demanding songs.  Neil Peart's
drumming was accurate and stunning as always.<p>
  The stage show was excellent.  Lasers, lights, live-action video and film
worked in unison with the feel of the songs, helping to flesh out their
meaning.  The only fault was a slight muddiness in the sound.<p>
  As soon as the opening strains of "2112" rang out, the audience became
frenzied.  Rush performed almost all of the progressive-rock masterpiece,
something they haven't done in years.<p>
  Rush started the second half of the concert with "Test for Echo", the title
track from their new album before moving on to the sythesizer-driven
"Subdivisions".<p>
  Continuing the trend of the first half of the show, Rush continued to draw
from all phases of their career, playing "Freewill" and the driving "Natural
Science" from <strong>Permanent Waves</strong>, before moving to "Time Stand 
Still" from <strong>Hold Your Fire</strong>.<p>
  Song after song was a rock-radio hit: "Tom Sawyer", "Closer to the Heart",
and others that proved that Rush is a band without equal.<p>
  Rush always brings something special to a concert.  Sunday was no exception;
they proved again that rock can be musical, mature and exciting.<p>
