 The batter stands<br>
 Without a sound<br>
 The air is thick, and still<p>

 All the eyes are focused on<br>
 The lonely pitcher's hill
</dd></dl><p>

Bleachers distorted in the halogen light<br>
The faces are twisted and grotesque<br>
Drunken and loud in the sweltering night<br>
The mob moves like demons possessed<br>
Completely obnoxious, waiting to fight -<br>
Confident their team is best<p>

<dl><dd>
 The righteous rise<br>
 With blurry eyes<br>
 Unfocused and unclear<p>

 Fat men fed on beer and fries<br>
 To eat, and burp, and cheer
</dd></dl>
<p>

They say there are dangers, to play for us<br>
Gotta dodge that wild ball<br>
But other sports are much more dangerous<br>
Have Bo Jackson tell you all<br>
Those who know what's best for us -<br>
Must try to save us from football<p>

<dl><dd>
 Quick to swing<br>
 Quick to anger<br>
 Slow to hit the ball<p>

 Being sent<br>
 Back to the bench<br>
 Or worse<br>
 The shower stall
</dd></dl><p>
