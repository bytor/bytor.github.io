Andy: 

Thank you for contacting Ernie Ball. 

While we were in the long process of getting 
John Petrucci's signature guitar completed, 
we made some prototypes for him to check out. 
We have no idea exactly when this was made, 
or even what color we called it. It was 
probably made some time in 2000. All we 
can really verify for you is that it did 
indeed come from the factory. It was an 
iridescent color that was never in production. 

Best regards,
