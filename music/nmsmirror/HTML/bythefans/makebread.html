So you're bakin' a few<br>
and you're not sure what you're gonna do<br>
Looks like you've got no rye<br>
none on the shelf to help you get by<p>

Make yourself some bread.<br>
Don't share it with Fred!<br>
Whether white, wheat or rye,<br>
your sandwich tastes so good,<br>
so good!<p>

Yes, you bake it all night;<br>
Ya know you've got to eat just right.<br>
So, you need some white,<br>
somethin' on which you can spread tonight<p>

Make yourself some bread.<br>
Don't share it with Fred!<br>
Whether white, wheat or rye,<br>
your sandwich tastes so good,<br>
so good!<p>

So your bread's not so fine<br>
well let me bake you one of mine<br>
I said you need some bread<br>
somthin' t'fill you up t'the end.<p>

Make yourself some bread.<br>
Don't share it with Fred!<br>
Whether white, wheat or rye,<br>
your sandwich tastes so good,<br>
so good!<p>
