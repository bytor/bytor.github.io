TANTALIZE ME<br>
APPETIZE ME<br>
FANTASIZE ME<br>
TENDERIZE ME<br>
MARIANTE ME<br>
SALIVATE ME<br>
SATIATE ME<br>
TRY-TO-SATE ME<p>

Harvest in my garden<br>
Chowder in my bowl<br>
Sugar in my larder<br>
Butter on my roll<p>

Confessions of an ice-cream lover<br>
Every day I'm gaining weight<br>
Learned my lessons from my mother<br>
Making sure I clean my plate<p>

Eatin' "Life" like Mikey<br>
Jelly in my roll<br>
Broadening my image<br>
Struggle for control<p>

Desire in my dark unconscious<br>
Chicken of the Tuna Sea<br>
I think I'll have to take my chances<br>
Know there's someone thin inside of me<p>

My diet starts -- my foolish heart<br>
A man must learn to rule his hungry part<br>
A shake to blend -- some rules to bend<br>
My strength of will has simply reached the end<p>

Unhappy face -- too much in haste<br>
A man must learn to deal with stomach aches<br>
A painful fate -- my inner state<br>
It must have been that twenty-seventh plate<p>
