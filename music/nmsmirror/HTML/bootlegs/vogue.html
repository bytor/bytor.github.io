Unlike all other CD bootlegs released that are copies of the "Grace Under
Pressure" video, this is the only TRUE recording. All others are missing the
encore, and some have extra songs from the "Exit... Stage Left" video.<p>

The sound on this -- since it's from a video soundtrack -- is excellent, 
although the crowd can be a bit loud at times. This was the very first Rush 
cd bootleg I bought, and it does sound great at high volumes. <p>

Packaging on this boot is minimal, and mostly incorrect. The recording was
obviously not done in 1987 as this cd indicates, and the two medleys are
listed in reverse order on the back. "YYZ" is also listed as "XYZ". And if
anyone can tell me what hands in handcuffs and skulls have to do with Rush,
I'd love to hear it.<p>

Really the only reason to buy this boot is if you're looking for a copy of the
GUP video soundtrack. Don't be fooled into buying this as some "new concert",
as it's merely a recording of something you most likely have anyways.<p>
