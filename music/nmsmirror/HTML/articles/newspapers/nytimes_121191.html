<font size=+1>More Technological Than Human</font><br>
<b>by KAREN SCHOEMER</b><p>

Rush's concert at Madison Square Garden on Friday night was so overwhelming
that it was easy to forget there were actually three men onstage. Before Geddy
Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart even took the stage, a wide-screen projection
showed a vaguely Cubist animated cartoon of the three musicians vaulting
through the air with their instruments. Throughout the set, the backdrop
intermittently displayed diverse and surreal images of drum kits suspended
over water, geometric computer graphics, children gazing at space ships and
flying bird's-eye views of landscapes.<p>

The music itself was not so much a collection of songs as a nonstop
technological force. Mr. Peart, the drummer, seldom played anything as simple
as a back beat, instead laying down complex, assaultive patterns with frequent
time changes. Mr. Lifeson's speedy, baroque guitar solos added the next
textural layer, with their counterpoint in Mr. Lee's florid, melodic bass
lines. But during numbers like "Roll the Bones," the title track from Rush's
latest album on Atlantic, most of the music seemed to come from prerecorded
backing tapes, anyway. Combine this with a film of a skeleton in Wayfarer
sunglasses doing an electronic rap, and the musicians themselves were
practically invisible.<p>

The thousands of teen-agers in the audience, most of them male, screamed every
lyric and punched their fists in the air. They played air guitar, air
keyboards, and air drums. Since Rush's 1974 debut album, continuing with early
1980's albums like "Permanent Waves" and "Moving Pictures," this band has been
a kind of rite of passage. With lyrics about such grand philosophic issues as
free will, destiny and apocalypse, Rush creates music that is bigger than
life, dazzling in its technological feats. The teen-age mind is chaos; Rush is
perfect order. It's like a sonic video game.<p>

On Friday night, Mr. Lee, who is also the vocalist, rarely addressed the
audience. He didn't move around onstage much, except to give a stiff kick here
and there. By the end of the concert and songs like "Tom Sawyer," swirling
prisms of laser light surrounded him and Mr. Lifeson, and one wondered whether
they were indeed robots or holograms. Then during the encore rendition of
"The Spirit of Radio," from "Permanent Waves," Mr. Lee suddenly smiled and
clapped Mr. Lifeson on the back. Such a simple gesture came as a tremendous
relief; they <b>were</b> human, after all.<p>
