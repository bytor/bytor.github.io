<font size=+1>After 20 years, rock band's music still a Rush</font><br>
<b>by KIRA L. BILLIK</b><p>

The cover of Rush's latest album, "Counterparts," shows things that can't
exist alone, such as a nut and bolt. <p>

The CD itself showcases three other things that haven't existed apart for
the past 20 years: drummer-lyricist Neal Peart, guitarist Alex Lifeson and
bassist-singer Geddy Lee. <p>

Peart attributes the Canadian band's longevity to a combination of
Lifeson's spontaneity, Lee's "melodic instinct" and "meticulous passion,"
and his own "obsessive drive." <p>

"We root each other and we uproot each other," said Peart. <p>

Rush, which performs here Monday night at the Sports Arena, has been
pushing the envelope of progressive rock since its first self-titled album
in 1974. Lee's bass playing has influenced many musicians to take the
instrument out of its strictly rhythmic role and into a melodic one. <p>

The band has done everything from concept albums ("2112") to live albums
("All the World's a Stage," "Exit . . . Stage Left," "A Show of Hands").
Its classic track "Tom Sawyer," from 1981's "Moving Pictures," is still
one of the most-requested songs on rock radio. Rush has done 18 records,
including a double-disc anthology in 1990, "Chronicles." <p>

The band's 19th effort is pared down, less dependent on technology and
more reliant on the natural sound of guitar, bass and percussion. <p>

The formula seems to have worked -- "Counterparts" debuted at No. 2 on
Billboard's album charts, the band's highest debuting release ever. <p>

Peart is Rush's wordsmith, and he is fascinated with the concept of yin
(the passive and negative female force) and yang (the active and positive
male force). He can use a nature metaphor one minute, a technical one the
next. <p>

He's also a disciplined writer who favors restraint over what he calls
"unabashed emotionalism." <p>

"Here's a lovely example: People always think, 'Oh, it must be so healthy
psychologically to be a drummer because you can just smash things all the
time.' Well, you can't. You have to control yourself. You have to smash
them at the right time with the right intensity and a sense of flow. . . .
I never feel released when I'm playing drums -- I just feel tremendously
disciplined." <p>

"Counterparts" deals with personal issues: the nature of love ("The Speed
of Love," "Cold Fire"); ambition ("Cut to the Chase"); and Carl Jung's
concept of the masculine animus and the feminine anima ("Animate"). <p>

But Peart says it's not conventionally introspective, but more a
combination of personal experience and imagined situations. <p>

"That's a style of lyricism that I congenially dislike," he said with a
laugh. "I'm not really fond of self-revelation in lyrics because I think
it's a bit indulgent." <p>

Peart's mind works as deftly as his drum patterns. He speaks of Jung, T.S.
Eliot, politics, history, his fascination with Chinese and African culture,
and his love of cycling in rapid succession. <p>

"These songs grow out of reading and conversations and thinking and driving
and collecting phrases," he said. <p>

He keeps a journal while traveling and says he has years' worth of
material gathered. And he finds certain themes repeating themselves. <p>

"That little gateway between innocence and experience I find I'm always
coming back to readdress," he said. "The nature of ambition, for instance,
gets examined in some way or another on probably nearly every record." <p>

Rush has been called stuffy and pompous by critics, and it tends to be a
band people either love or can't stand. But the seriousness of Rush often
masks the humor. <p>

On the "Roll the Bones" tour, two huge inflatable rabbits (echoing the
cover of the 1989 album, "Presto") arose from the sides of the stage and
bobbed along in time to "Tom Sawyer." And the title of Rush's live album,
"Exit . . . Stage Left," was in deference to the cartoon character
Snagglepuss. <p>

Peart admits that 20 years of touring has taken its toll, and the band has
discussed giving it up. <p>

"I always tend to push for continuing to tour because I think it's so
important a part of a vital band," he said. "I think for the risk-taking
aspect, for the discipline of playing at 100 percent night after night,
playing live takes you to a level that you would never willingly drive
yourself to. <p>

"It's not easy, but I have to think the equation works out for the good. 
It is good." <p>
