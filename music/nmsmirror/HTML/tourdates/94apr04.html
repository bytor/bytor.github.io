<font size=+1>Still getting a rush from (the group) Rush</font><br>
<b>by David Surkamp</b><p>

TWENTY years, 18 albums and a thousand stages later, the
Canadian progressive rock trio Rush continues to blaze its singular
musical path. It is one of the few acts of its generation that can
truly say its best work is not yet behind them, and bassist/singer
Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart
brought their "Counterparts" tour to The Arena Monday evening to
prove it. <p>

"Counterparts" is a big-budget spectacle, with giant inflatable
bunnies appearing from nowhere, flames bursting from various
areas of the stage and a concussive explosion punctuating Peart's
drum solo. From the opening video sequence of a nut and bolt
uniting in outer space, it was evident that the staging was to be
among the most impressive of the band's career. <p>

What was also striking is how naturally the threesome has matured
musically, with synthesizer and sequencer embellishments
combining with its power trio roots seamlessly. <p>

For example, after Lifeson's strumming, 12-string acoustic
introduction to "Nobody's Hero," the arrangement swelled into a
complex texture produced by Lee's keyboard and bass juxtaposed
with Peart's shifting underpinning. <p>

Other selections from "Counterparts," such as "Cold Fire," "Stick
It Out" and "Animate," received equally inventive treatment, with
"Double Agent," a number even Lee referred to as unusual,
coming across as a real standout. Looking back a few pages in its
career, the title track to the group's 1991 release, "Roll the
Bones," turned out to be a real crowd pleaser. During that
number, Lifeson's polished hypnotic phrasing supported one of
Lee's best vocal performances of the evening. <p>

One of my favorite moments of the evening occurred during
"Closer to the Heart." After a mesmerizing instrumental, Lee
confidently ripped into a savage attack on his Fender Jazz bass that
highlighted his command of the instrument. <p>

While many acts would prefer not to hire a viable opening act,
Rush has always made a point of finding the most striking talents
available. Primus was no exception. Still merrily "Sailing the Seas
of Cheese," bassist/vocalist Les Claypool's quirky collection of
tunes was the perfect complement to the program. With a vocal
nasality second to none and a slippery bass technique that is
simply flooring, Claypool acquainted the crowd with material
from "Pork Soda" and illustrated why the group is one of the most
inventive acts to emerge from the San Francisco scene in the last
decade. <p>
