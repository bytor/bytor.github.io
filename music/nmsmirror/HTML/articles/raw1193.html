<strong>
  ... and bongs, and widdles and pars, as RUSH ditch the keyboards
and get ready to Rock on their fab newie, <strong>Counterparts</strong>. And that's
not the only shock in store, as GEDDY LEE tells HOWARD JOHNSON about
the fights, rows and general weirdness that enter the equation when
you're a member of the worlds leading Techno Rock Trio ...
</strong>
<p>
 
It's hard to imagine that 12 years have passed since Canadian power
trio Rush slotted neatly into the stndard "Heavy Rock" bracket.
Nevertheless, the group still boast a hardcore fanbase, and earn
healthy respect from Rock fans of every hue. But on the eve of the
release of <strong>Counterparts</strong>, the bands eight album since '81's 
<strong>Moving
Pictures</strong>, there's still a faint yearning that Rush will return to the 
fray armed wil bell bottoms, kimonos, word and sorcery lyrics and
Alex Lifeson"s Jimmy Page hand-me-down riffs. <strong>Counterparts</strong>, of
course, does noting of the sort. Rush have always been about
progression rather than stagnation. And, secretly, I think that's how
we like it.
<p>
<dl><dd>
 
"There are moments on <strong>Counterparts</strong> that are heavier than anything
we have ever done in a long time," says Rush's mild-mannered
vocalist/bassist/keyboardist Geddy Lee, hair cut to shoulder length
and sporting blue, rounded Lennon specs. "But even if we became
really heavy again it wouldn't be like the way we were on <strong>2112</strong>.
Those records were made in a a certain time and place and the only way 
we'd be able to recreate it would be accidentally. If we did it on
purpose it would sound like bullshit."
</dd></dl>
<p>
 
Lee dosn't like bullshit. Fortunately, he's not at all reticent
about discussing the band's past.
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
 "A lot of the early stuff I'm really proud of," he says. "Some of it 
sounds really goofy, but some of it stands up better than I gave it
credit for. As weird as my voice sounds when I listen back, I
certainly dig some of the arrangements. I can't go back beyond <strong>2112</strong> 
really, because that starts to get a bit hairy for me, and if I hear
"Lakeside Park" on the radio I cringe. What a lousy song! Still, I
don't regret anything that I've done!"
</dd></dl>
<p>
  
 And why should he? Alongside guitarist Lifeson and drummer/lyricist
Neil Peart, Rush have grown old gracefully. Not too many embarassing
moments, a remarkable body of work, plus solid success. By
steadfastly refusing to pay any attention to whims and fads, Rush
have sustained a 20 year career with ease.
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
  "I don't know how to explain it", Lee offers, "I guess our fans are 
as weird as we are. And I think that they appreciate the emotion and
craftmanship that goes into our records.
<p>
 "Every time I go into the studio to start on a new album I ask
myself the same question: 'Why am I doing this again?'. The only
answer that I can come up with is because of the satisfaction I get
from creating and producing something.
<p>
 "The three of us are very united in our work ethic. It's in our
nature to want to improve the songwriting. Sometimes you spend ages
trying to make a smooth transition from bridge to chorus in an
emotional way and you'll finally achieve it, only to to find that
you've already done it on a track ten years ago. You can end up
chasing your own tail, so I tend not to look any further back than
the last album."
</dd></dl>
<p>
 
 Because you'd get too depressed?
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
  "I don't get depressed. I just get startled!"
</dd></dl>
<p>
 
You won't be startled by <strong>Counterparts</strong>, which seamlessly continues
the linear heritage started by '82's <strong>Signals</strong> and continued by
<strong>Grace Under Pressure</strong> and '91's <strong>Roll The Bones</strong>. Sure "Stick It Out" 
nods its head a little more frantically than of late, but "Animate",
"Alien Shore" and "Between Sun and Moon" sound like Rush doing what
Rush do best.
<p>
 
All the more surprising then, that Lee reveals that this was the most 
fractious album Rush has ever made.
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
"The title came after the record, which isn't always the way it
works. We're at that period in our lives where we're starting to
question our relationahips with each other. You start to ask 'Why am
I still hanging around with these guys?' To some extent <strong>Counterparts</strong> 
is a recognition of how the three of us have grown in different ways of the 
past few years.
<p>
 
"There were certainly a lot more fights during these sessions," muses 
Lee. "Almost every Monday morning Alex and I would have a full-blown, 
in-your-face argument. It was probably a good thing."
</dd></dl>
<p>
 
 Lee doesn't sound too convinced, though.
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
 "You could see it coming on the last tour," he continues. "Both Alex 
and I would have our moments, but our fights have always been very
brotherly. When you spend more time apart you develop a stronger
sense of what you like and what you don't like. Our musical vision
certainly isn't as similar as it was, so we'd end up questioning each 
other more. When ideas come up that you're not comfortable with, it
either leads to an agreement or an argument. The more confident you
get as a human being, the more likely you are to stand your ground."
</dd></dl>
<p>
 
 So who won this battle? Well once you've listened to the depth of
arrangement on <strong>Counterparts</strong>, you'll probably call it a dead heat.
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
 "Alex is very reactionary," continues Lee. "He must have said 10,000 
times that he didn't want any keyboards on the album, so when I
brought my keyboards into the studio there was an immediate
atmosphere. He kept looking at them like they were really
threatening. Now we wrote all the last album on bass, guitar and
drums and added the keys at the end to embelish. That was the only
reason the keys were there - or maybe to help me express myself when
I was painted into a musical corner - but Alex was making assumptions
that I wanted keyboards all over the place. It was a very volatile
situation."
</dd></dl>
<p>
 
Rush aren't exactly what you'd call a party band. Still, according
to their latest bio, a lot of their inherent humor is cruelly
overlooked. Indeed, Lee assures me that they 'had hours of hilarity'
in the studio when they weren't fighting. Why, then, own up to all
the turmoil on planet Rush?
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
 "It's just a way of trying to dispel some of our myths," Lee shrugs.
"We're a vert tight knit unit. I think we have the capacity to
alienate people without realizing it. I've been told that coming into
our dressing room isn't the most pleasant of experiences and it
doesn't make me feel good to hear that. I'd like to feel that we were 
open and welcoming. We do have this cold, intellectual image and I
can see where it stems from - we were kinda serious when we were
young. It's not the whole picture, although I'm certainly not over
here on a goodwill tour. I'm not working hard to be consider
light-hearted, like U2, but there are a lot of preconceptions about
Rush, some of which are correct and some of which are not!"
</dd></dl>
<p>
 
  One particular preconception is that Neil Peart rarely tackles
subjects to do with love and sex. "Nobody's Hero" boldly addresses
homosexuality and AIDS, and there's a sneaking suspicion that some of 
Rush's audience might find the whole affair somewhat controversial.
Lee is unrepentant:
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
 "If people think that discussing homosexuality is controversial,
then they've been living under a rock. "Nobody's Hero" will probably
polarise people, even though the AIDS issue is only a small part of
the lyrical theme, and peple will probably jump to conclusions.
That's their problem. I don't worry about it, whether it's brave or
foolish or whatever. When things affet you, you talk about them and
it comes out in your music. You let it fly. I never had the slightest
idea that it could be interpreted as controversial until someone
pointed it out to me after we'd finished the record. I guess I've
always worked in the music business, which is very tolerant
environment."
</dd></dl>
<p>
 
Rush, however has worked as an island within a fast running stream,
never joining the main flow and keeping a healthy distance from the
back-slapping and intermingling:
<p>
 
<dl><dd>
 "We don't live in a very 'music business' environment", claims Lee.
"The main reason why we aren't seen around is due to time. We keep
getting offered a lot of stuff, but we made a decision seven or eight 
years ago that time that wasn't Rush time was our own time. It would
be no holiday coming out of a Rush project and bouncing straight into 
another one with other people. I need time for familly, for personal
travel, all kinds of interest outside of music. I don't know if that
means we're less obsessed about music than most musicians or that we
just get enough of our ya-yas out in Rush. But, like most things
Rush, that's just the way it is."
