Infection transmitted<br>
Gumline recedes<br>
Molars get impacted<br>
Invisibly<p>

It takes dental telepathy<br>
To see that cavity<br>
The drill is making contact<br>
So painfully<p>

Eye teeth die<br>
Chewing's getting harder<br>
Teeth fall out<br>
No flouride in the water<br>
A to O<br>
Blood flows it's quite a bother<br>
Oh but how<br>
Do teeth make contact<br>
With one another?<p>

Proctology?  Podiatry?<br>
Seems to me it's dentistry<p>

Muzak transmitted<br>
Muzak received<br>
Music in the office<br>
Is grating on me<p>

There's no dental empathy<br>
If you change identity<br>
They will have to extract<br>
Inevitably<p>

One, two, three<br>
Count your new impactions<br>
Crowns and crowns<br>
Multiplied extractions<br>
A to O<br>
Blood flows it's quite a bother<br>
Oh but how<br>
Do teeth make contact<br>
With one another?<p>
</body>
