FROM BRAINWAVES TO TIDAL WAVES:<br>
THE STORY BEHIND RUSH'S ALBUM COVERS
</font></font><br><br>
 
<strong>
by Jeffrey Morgan<p>

  Because I live in Toronto (and happen to love loud rock 'n' roll), I was
asked to write a feature on Rush for this Special Edition (of course, the fact
that I also happen to be a Contributing Editor to CREEM might also have
something to do with it).<p>
 
  It seemed an easy enough assignment; after all, I'd been following Rush's
career ever since I saw them opening for the New York Dolls on October 27,
1973 at the late, lamented Victory Burlesque Theatre on Spadina Avenue.  Since
then I'd watched them proceed from the then unheard-of feat of performing
three nights in a row at Massey Hall to playing three nights in a row at Maple
Leaf Gardens- and being able to give away one of the night's proceeds to
charity.<p>
 
  So I dug out my Rush collection to see if I could say anything new about
their records that hadn't been said before when I suddenly realized that I was
looking at a whole aspect of Rush that had been virtually ignored by writers
over the past decade: their album covers.<p>
 
  And because Rush's album covers are every bit an integral part of the band
is its music, I decided to take advantage of my geographical location by
calling up Hugh Syme.<p>
 
  Rush fans will instantly recognize his name.  In addition to playing piano
and synthesizers on three of the band's albums, Hugh has been the man
responsible for an of Rush's album covers since 1975.<p>
 
  And although he was under the gun of a weekend-long deadline, Hugh agreed to
take time out from his busy schedule to discuss his work with the band.<p>

<strong>Q:</strong> How did you get involved with Rush in the first place?<p>
<dl><dd>
 
<strong>A:</strong> I was working with the Ian Th??, at the time and, having always been
intrigued by album cover graphics as a vehicle for selling albums--and because
of my background in art having been, you know, forever - I basically requested
to do one of Ian's albums.  I've always been into painting and drawing and
Anthem Records [Rush's Canadian label] - basically, it can be said that Anthem
is Rush - saw my album graphics and wanted me to do something for them.<p>
</dd></dl>
 
<strong>Q:</strong> What was the first album you did for Rush?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> The first one I did was Caress Of Steel.<p>
</dd></dl>
 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> The illustrations are yours, right?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, they are.<p>
</dd></dl>
 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Were they done specifically for the album?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, they were.  They were pencil drawings, even though they don't look
like it on the album, They printed them in a sort of pseudo-sepia tone.  I had
vignetted with an airbrush the blue area around the illustrations, which was
later reinterpreted by the film strippers who were making the jackets in
Chicago at the time.  They took it upon themselves to cut a hard-edged mask
around it.  The lettering was cast, and chrome plated.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong>  On the inside cover of 2112 is the first appearance of what has become a
logo of sorts for the band.<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Initially, that logo didn't begin as an identity factor for the band, it
just got adopted.  We didn't consider it a mascot overall icon of
representation for the band at the time.<p>
 
  What I did do with that particular cover was read their lyrics, and
understand that there is a good force and a bad force: the good force was
music, creativity, and freedom of expression-and the bad force was anything
that was contrary to that.<p>
 
  The man is the hero of the story.  That he is nude is just a classic
tradition ... the pureness of his person and creativity without the trappings
of other elements such as clothing.  The red star is the evil red star of the
Federation, which was one of Neil's symbols.  We basically based that cover
around the red star and that hero.<p>
 
  Now, that hero and that kind of attitude about freedom of expression and the
band having that kind of feeling ... at the time, it never ready occurred to
me, to be honest with you, that they would adopt it quite so seriously as a
logo.  Because it's appeared just about everywhere, thereafter.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> All The World's A Stage is a pretty straight-forward cover, except that the
original pressings of the album came with a triple gatefold jacket.<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, well, that was during the hiatus of outrageous packaging.  As I said,
AGI in Chicago did all of Rush's printing then, up until about four years ago. 
Albums like Ooh La La by the Faces, and Physical Graffiti-all of that was
going on then, so we thought we'd go for a six panel jacket.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> By comparison, A Farewell To Kings is fairly complex.<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, the sky and the foreground are not in the same place.  The buildings
and the sky are from Toronto, and the foreground was a demolished warehouse in
Buffalo.<p>
 
  I would've loved a cathedral in the same condition, or something more worthy
of the pathos you were intended to feel for an old building being in that
state.<p>
 
  We also began a series of puns with that album, in that the King is a puppet
King.  There have been a lot of criticisms of the Throne over the past couple
of decades as being a heritage that we really can't disregard, but certainly
don't take as seriously as we used to.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> The next album to be released was the Archives anthology.<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Well, that's basically a sore point with the marketing aspect of the
management.  They had the name of the package in mind as Archives, and I had
every intention of making a look as much a part of the archives as possible-as
opposed to being a rock 'n' roll cover.  It's almost a library piece.  It's
changed a little bit: it was sort of repackaged again two years ago.  For all
the cover being very sedate-albeit a little boring and uneventful-it involved
a special cover treatment which was actually more expensive than most covers.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> How do you feel about Hemispheres?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Not as well as I feel about most of them.<p>
 
  The band told me, "Go ahead, we'll see it when we get back," because they
were In Wales for the whole album and all my conversations with them were over
the telephone.  They didn't see it until it got out.  Technically, it's an
abomination.<p>
 
  Once again, it's an effort in the progressive area of punning.  They talk
about Apollo and Dionysius in the lyrics, so I figured that Apollo would be
the severe, Magritte business man, and that Dionysius would, again, be the
reinstitution of a figure.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Permanent Waves is one of the all-time classic rock 'n'roll covers.  How
did it come about?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Permanent Waves is the result of a conversation which I had with Neil out
at his home in the country.  We spoke all evening about Rush growing up, and
how we were going to do these EKG readings of each member as they were
recording.  We were going to tape their temples and chests and have real
heartbeats of them while they were playing.  So Permanent Waves was going to
be a technical statement, and we were going to treat that with red and gold
foil, and do a nice study in design- as opposed to a photographic thing.<p>
 
  I walked out and, in the doorway, said "Wait! Let's try something with Donna
Reed, with her permanent Toni hairdo, and have her walking out of a tidal wave
situation.<p>
 
  Neil gave me this blank look and said, "Get out of here."<p>
 
  The following day, he asked me to consider doing just that because he'd
discussed it with the band, and they'd all thought it was more likely for a
cover than the serious approach.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Were there many problems to overcome?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> We shot the newspaper with the headline "Dewey Defeats Truman," which now
looks like "(Arabic)-Daily-(Arabic)," because we got a threat from the legal
people at the Chicago Tribune, who are still embarrassed about their
over-anxious printing of that headline.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> I noticed that the "Y"in "Dewey" has been changed to an "I" in the
headline.<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> That's because anything that pertains to that headline, according to the
Chicago Tribune, is an embarrassment, and is subject to litigation if we were
to print up any facet of it.<p>
 
  To boot, Coca-Cola asked that we strip out their billboard way off in the
background because it was too close to a cotton-clad mons pubis.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Who's the smiling gent leaning next to the crosswalk sign?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> None of your business!<p>
</dd></dl>
 
<strong>Q:</strong> OK, let's move on to Moving Pictures, which is-<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> A pun, a pure pun.<p>
 
  It became pertinent to me later that the Queen's Park building In Toronto
where it was shot had all the right elements: three arches, three pillars per
arch; there are three members of Rush, and all of that.<p>
</dd></dl>
 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Who decided on what paintings would be carried?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> That's was the band's decision.  I asked that the witch be in there, only
because of the song "Witch Hunt," which I played on.<p>
 
  The one painting had to be of Joan Of Arc as far as I was concerned- which
ended up being a bit of a nightmare because I couldn't find any archival
pictures or paintings which were suitable.  So I ended up getting some burlap,
and a pine post, two sticks and a bottle of scotch.<p>
 
  Deborah Samuel, the photographer who I used on that session, got wrapped up
in burlap so she could make her cameo appearance.  We just lit lighter fluid
in pie plates in the foreground.  It was basically a half hour session because
we had no other alterative but to do it ourselves.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Exit ... Stage Left is probably your most ambitious cover to date, what
with it reprising all your previous covers.<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> It was shot in a condemned theatre here in Toronto, which shall remain
nameless.  We decided to go with the girl pulling the curtain back on the
front instead of the back.  It was originally intended to be the other way
around, so when I flipped the photograph over, I had to write "RUSH" on the
equipment box in the foreground, and I had to strip out the information on the
Stage Door and write in the word "EXIT," because the album was called Exit ...
Stage Left.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Is the stage shot actually from a Rush concert?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Buffalo shot, yeah.  We went out to get that, too.  We really wanted the
band-.  Believe it or not, we went to about 15 shows, trying to get the band
saying "Thank you, good night," and at the same time, and walking towards the
camera.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Couldn't get it, though?<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Couldn't get it.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> Well.  I guess that just leaves the dog and the fire hydrant.<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> Well, I was given the word "Signals." It was such a broad concept that it
was baffling for all of us.  We really had trouble with that one, and I
decided that, with such a phenomenally important word with the kind of potency
it potentially had, to go with something really dumb, really inane.  But
something which would still tie in with songs such as "Chemistry," and the
subdivision aspect of the fire hydrants, lawns, and neighborhood dogs.<p>
</dd></dl> 
 
<strong>Q:</strong> I can't see Neil going for it, somehow.<p>
 
<dl><dd>
<strong>A:</strong> That one almost got vetoed.  Two of the three band members liked it at
first, but I was taking a chance with it because it was so inane.  But It
seems to be interpreted as an integral part of the package.<p>
 
  The back cover's a little subtle, perhaps over-indulgent.  Again, it's been
fodder for some of those quizzes you hear on the radio.<p>
 
  It hasn't been totally ignored...<p>
