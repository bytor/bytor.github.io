This cd boot is the exact same as Enemies Within and Beyond and Live In
Toronto 1986, but missing one song "Limelight". It basically is a copy of the
GUP video soundtrack, missing a few songs, and one song ("Freewill") taken
from the ESL video soundtrack.<p>

It isn't as sharp-sounding as Toronto, but neither is the crowd so 
overpowering. It also has some 'glitches' where the sound seems to drop out of
one channel for an instant and then return. It happens so fast that you might
not even notice it.<p>

The cover has a nice picture of Geddy from a later tour, and the inside of the
booklet has a gorgeous collage of the band, but the company chose to put their
catalog on the back of the booklet. And something has to be said for a company 
which can't even decide what the bootleg's name is. "Life" Under Pressure 
appears on the front of the cd booklet and on the back, but on the spine and 
cd itself appears as "Live".<p>

An interesting side-note, this cd claims that it was recorded in Pennsylvania
on July 8, 1984. Rush did indeed play that date, but gee doesn't that intro to
"Finding My Way" sound just like the GUP video? And what about that whistler
in "Witch Hunt"? Maybe they hired a guy to go to every show and whistle in the
exact same place in the exact same way. Hm...<p>

This isn't one to buy. If you want the same songs plus one extra track, try
Live in Toronto 1986. Or if you'd rather have a true GUP soundtrack, try
Currently In Vogue.<p>
