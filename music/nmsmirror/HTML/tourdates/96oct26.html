<font size=+1>RUSH STICKS WITH TRADITION FOR ROCKFORD CONCERT</font><br>
<strong>By Edith Lee</strong><p>

Subtlety is not a real important virtue in rock.<p>

Therefore you get the suggestive opening video scene of Rush's Saturday night
MetroCentre concert:  The theme to 2001: A Space Odyssey plays while a bolt
slowly screws into a nut.<p>

Neither was the Rush show for the faint of ear.  Except for a few acoustic
introductions, the volume was loud enough to make me wonder how many in the
mostly GenX/late Baby Boomer crowd will begin losing their hearing now.<p>

Also, the band fell into a few rock cliches, including the obligatory crowd
clap-alongs, the smoke and light show.<p>

But Rush's three-hour show still rocked in a way that said, "Take that,
grunge boys!"<p>

Granted, the 5,100 fans there might not have caught all of the progressive
and philosophical rock themes like alienation and hypocrisy.  Some may have
been too busy drinking beer, pumping fists or banging their heads to notice
the musicianship.  But it was all there, courtesy of a band with two decades
of performance under their belts.<p>

Lead singer Geddy Lee, who helped give the band its trademark sound with one
of the most distinctive wails in rock, still has it.  He played some
keyboard, but the band seemed to click best when he was on bass.  When he,
lead guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart blasted at full volume,
the Lifeson and Peart dropped out for three- or four- bar bass solo, Lee got
to show off more than his voice.<p>

Rush pumped out the hits, including "Tom Sawyer", "The Trees", "Roll the
Bones" and "Nobody's Hero" and several songs from the new album Test for
Echo. , including the title track, "Limbo" and "Half the World".  The single
"Driven" with its hyper beat was one of the best.<p>

This tour has been touted as the band's biggest stage production ever.  The
math bears it out; four semis and four busses stood outside the venue, while
a three-man band performed inside.<p>

The laser beams, giant globes of white lights and prop satellites were all
right, but it was the big-screen, dual video backdrops that lent the most to
the show.  On "Test for Echo" the images of political and religious figures
and money spoke volumes.  The alternating closeups of Pearts hands and entire
drumsets were synchronized to his killer solo.<p>

The drum solo.  Now there's usually a cliche.  Often I begin yawning seconds
after they begin.  Not Peart's.  It had to be one of the best I ever heard.
 It wasn't all snare, bass and top hat (sic).  Like a good drummer, he
actually made the drums beat out a melody, not just a beat.<p>

As for the concert's volume, loud as it was, we would have lost something if
they cut down on the volume by eliminating the stereo of the hanging speakers
facing the stage.<p>

The band acknowledged the petition drive which reportedly put Rockford on the
tour.  "We appreciate the gesture", Lee said.<p>
