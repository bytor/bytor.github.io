<em>November 23, 1993</em>
<p>

It was long after midnight,<br>
When we got to necking passionately<br>
She said I'm not that kind of girl,<br>
Don't get the wrong idea.<p>

I said I've got to get my rocks off<br>
I haven't screwed in a hundred weeks<br>
She said you're outta luck buddy -<br>
I won't put out for you.<br>
I'm out of here<br>
Because you must cool down<br>
Right now<p>

It was just before sunrise<br>
When we started taking off our clothes<br>
She said I hope you brought a condom<br>
You won't get to far without it.<p>

I said if sex has these conditions<br>
I don't understand those beer ads<br>
She said you ain't Spuds McKenzie<br>
You live in fantasy-land<br>
I'm out of here<br>
Because you must cool down<br>
Right now<p>

I want you now-<br>
The only thing that keeps me sane<br>
Is a cold shower<br>
I need it bad-<br>
My only friend right now<br>
Is a cold shower<br>
Please, Please, Please, Please-<br>
The ache in my nards is assuaged by some time<br>
In a cold shower<br>
Maybe tomorrow?-<br>
I'll make it through, somehow<br>
With a cold shower<p>
