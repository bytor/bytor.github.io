by Peter Rein<br>
<em>September 26, 1977</em>
<p>

You'll select me<br>
If I effect thee<br>
You'll expect me<br>
to protect thee<p>

I'll compromise thee<br>
You'll despise me<br>
I'll surprise thee<br>
My lies flow free<p>

Voices of the masses<br>
I can't hear you speak<br>
I defend the innocent<br>
As I cripple the weak<p>

Pay me off with bribes<br>
Blackmail me if you can<br>
I'll always plead the fifth<br>
That's the platform on which I ran<p>

<b>(chorus)</b><p>

Mistress in the Blue Room<br>
Commies in the red<br>
Keep your checks to yourself<br>
I prefer cash instead<p>

I'd sell out my country<br>
or my wife if that's your choice<br>
Politics is a dirty game<br>
Dominated by a minor voice<p>

<b>(chorus)</b><p>

My constituents, your ignorance<br>
My speeches put you in a sedated trance<br>
You kiss my ass, as I reach for the brass<br>
Shake my hand, now go, it's time to pass<br>
A jaded smile, move single file<br>
For you, my bullshit I will pile<br>
Democracy, hypocrisy<br>
GIve all you can, expect nothing back from me<p>

Validate me<br>
Candidate me!<p>
