<font size=+1>Rock: Rush, of Canada</font><br>
<b>By Stephen Holden</b><p>

"In the high school halls/ In the shopping malls/ Conform or be cast out,"
goes the song "Subdivisions," from the latest album by the Canadian rock
trio Rush. Sentiments like these, which mark the quintessence of solemn
teen-age angst in contemporary rock, are one reason that Rush is so
phenomenally popular with adolescents. This popularity was demonstrated
Thursday in Madison Square Garden, where Rush opened a sold-out two-night
stand. "Subdivisions" was greeted with enthusiastic recognition by a very
young and adoring crowd.  <p>

Like its message -- a mixture of psychadelicized science-fiction and grim
social determinism -- Rush's music is appropirately bombastic. The band's
characteristic tunes are modal blues fragments elongated and sweetened with
arty, even romantic, flourishes. Geddy Lee is the lead singer and bassist
and his tenor yelps find a comfortable middle ground between the
aggressiveness of English heavy metal and the softer English art rock.  <p>

Instrumentally, Rush's strongest asset is its drummer-lyricist Neil Peart,
whose bag of tricks runs from goose-stepping heavy-metal patterns to
hard-rock reggae. While Thursday's concert offered a more convincing case
for Rush than any album, the music still seemed an entirely unoriginal
blend of heavy-metal and art-rock borrowings attached to unmemorable
tunes.
