<p>

Terrorize me<br>
Tenderize me<br>
Pulverize me<br>
Circumcise me...<p>

Lacerate me<br>
Dominate me<br>
Penetrate me<br>
Flagellate me...<p>

Mistress of my pleasure<br>
Treat me like a slave<br>
Hit me with your forty lashes<br>
Force me to behave<p>

Priestess of the leather hip-boots<br>
Goddess of the shining chains<br>
Keeper of the Iron Maiden<br>
Sole provider of my pains<p>

(chorus)<p>

Handcuffs in the morning<br>
Tie me to the bed<br>
No need to give me pleasure<br>
I want pain instead!<p>

Dark bewitching dominatrix<br>
Crush me with stiletto heels<br>
Whip me, beat me, make me grovel<br>
You can't know how good it makes me feel!<p>

(chorus)<p>

My evil queen, my love machine<br>
Show me how you like to treat me mean.<br>
Sadistic fire, my dark desire<br>
Punish me, control me with your ire.<br>
Spike-studded style, black widow smile<br>
My joy is in submission to your wiles<br>
A shining ring...Hey, where's my thing?<br>
Exquisite pain to make my hormones sing.<p>

(chorus)<p>

Castigate me<br>
Masturbate me!<p>
