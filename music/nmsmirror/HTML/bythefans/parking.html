<font size=+3>The Parking Space</font><br>
by Nicole Youngman<br>
<em>December 3, 1995</em>
<p>

There is unrest on the campus<br>
There is trouble in the air<br>
For the students want more parking<br>
And the profs just won't be fair<p>

The students keep coming in late<br>
'Cause they just can't find a place<br>
They say "The profs are just too tenured<br>
And they take up all the space!"<br>
But the profs can't really help it<br>
If they like parking in the shade<br>
"And if it rains, well, all those students<br>
Are just going to have to wade!"<p>

There is trouble on the campus<br>
The rent-a-cops all have fled<br>
As students circulate petitions<br>
And proposals to be read<p>

Then they formed a student union<br>
And demanded to be heard<br>
"That Ivory Tower's just too distant<br>
We will make them send us word!"<br>
Now there's no more parking problem<br>
For they all have been outbid<br>
And the good spots all have gone to<br>
The Administration's kids!<p>
