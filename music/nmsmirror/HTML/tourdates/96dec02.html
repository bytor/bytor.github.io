RUSH DELIVERS PRECISELY WHAT FANS WANT</font><br>
<strong>by Hector Saldana</strong><P>

   Like actor Richard Dreyfus' irresistable urge for contact in "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind," nearly 11,000 loyal Rush fans packed
into the Alamodome Monday night for reaffirmation with Geddy Lee, Alex
Lifeson, and Neil Peart.<p>
   Why? Because after 22 years together, the members of Rush (like Ol'
Blue Eyes) still do it their way, if sometimes a bit heavy-handedly.<p>
   Gone are the spectacular, thunderous, unpredictable bomb effects of
old that would more than occasionally punctuate the live sound and
thrill the red-eyed masses. In their place was the perfection of
follow spots, lasers and digital MTV-style video.<p>
   "The Trees" was accompanied by cursory video visions of magnificent
maples, while the smooth pop of "Half The World," from the new "Test
For Echo" album, offered inane images of the band and a signpost
reading "the half."<p>
   Live footage worked best, allowing those without binoculars to see
Lifeson, Peart and Lee get down and rock.<p>
   Lee's high, nasal vocal still cuts distinctively through the
three-piece bombast. The singer roamed the stage freely with his
Fender Jazz bass, often joking with Lifeson, who lorded over a barrage
of guitar pedals.<p>
   Peart's drums sounded like cannon fire. The numerous high-pitched
tom-toms were mercilessly whacked in inimitible trademark fashion by
the gifted drummer, so fond of odd time signatures.<p>
   The new instrumental "Limbo" was loud and percussive. Sampled
voices, seemingly out of nowhere, eerily drifted from suspended
speakers in the middle of the Alamodome for a surprise effect.<p>
   Technology has taken more of a toll on Rush than age. Lifeson's
mastery of chorus effects tends to mush-up his driving chord attack.
Lee's abandonment of his clackity Rickenbacker 4001 bass maybe makes
sonic sense but lacks character.<p>
   Straight-ahead arrangements worked best. "Closer to the Heart" was
instantly recognizable, but it was on "2112" that the old lion roared
fiercely, in large part because Lifeson decided to play loud and
rough.<p>
   After a brief intermission, Rush returned with the popular
meta-physical paen "Free Will," followed by "Roll the Bones,"
featuring some inventive video accompaniment.<p>
   The concert was a giant lovefest. Lee and company deliver the goods
like consummate pros, trading the old rawness for modern precision.
Hey, it's the '90s.<p>
