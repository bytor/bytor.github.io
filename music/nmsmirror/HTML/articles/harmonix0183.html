<font size=+2>Interview with ALEX LIFESON</font><br>
<b>by Ted Veneman</b><p>
<em> [ Taken from <b>Harmonix</b> -- Jarnuary/February 1983 ] </em><p>

<em>
This is an interview conducted by Ted Veneman, the owner of Veneman Music in
Rockville, Maryland.  He and Alex had been friends for many years - you will
still find images of Rush in the store.  The music store published a music
paper / ad supplement for quite a few years (I don't think they do any
longer) called "Harmonix" in which this interview appeared.  On the front
page there is a photo of Alex on stage with his black strat; within the body
of the interview are five photos of Alex during the interview (wearing a
T-shirt from The Commons). The interview took place during the Signals tour.<p>

Remember that Ted Veneman is a music store owner and NOT a journalist - the
interview is reproduced here (without permission) exactly as it appears in
the paper - punctuation, grammar, and the rest.  I hope you enjoy it.<p>
</em>

     Alex Lifeson, Rush's dynamic guitarist, was raised in Toronto, Canada
and began his career much the same as everyone else -- from basements to bars
and eventually, after many years of hard work, to the concert stage.  He is
talented, yet down-to-earth and quite unaffected by his success.<p>
     Alex and I had talked about doing an interview for nearly a year.
 Actually, we both prefer to call it a conversation that took place on tape.
 Over the years he's done many interviews, all of which brought up the same
old questions:  How old were you when you started playing ... who were your
major influences ... what do you like about this guitar ... etc., etc.  He
really wasn't interested in another typical interview and frankly, I wasn't
either so I suggested that we just have a conversation with the tape rolling.
 We don't see each other that often so it was a convenient way to catch up on
lost time.  Our conversation runs the gamut from life on the road to cars and
food and even the space shuttle.  I hope you enjoy this different look at one
of rock's finest players, a real gentleman and good friend.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     You were saying that you can't wait for this leg of the tour to be over.
 What are you going to do?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     It ends on the 15th of December and I welcome the rest that's coming.
 We've been away so much.  Actually the problem is we went down and spent a
week on Neil's boat in the Virgin Islands.  So that put us two months away
from home.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     That's not a bad way to be away from home.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     No, it was great.  We had a riot and it's a fantastic thing to do.  But,
had we been home at some point in there and then gone away and done that, it
would have been different.  I mean we had a great time.  I don't know if
we'll get around to doing it again but it was fantastic and we all got really
close on the boat and drank more and laughed more -- I think we had the
record of non-stop laughter.  But like I said, it was tough not being home.
 Everybody's got families and we'd like to spend some time at home.  Then we
played in Toronto and that was really crazy.  It's always crazy when we play
at home.  The backstage area is packed, there are ten thousand people
backstage that you haven't seen in a while.  It's a tough thing to deal with.
 I don't feel relaxed at all.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     So, even when you're home it's almost like being away.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     I mean even being home for one week once a month there's so much stuff
you have to catch up on that you really have to get your scheduling together
and decide how much time you are going to spend with your family or what time
you are going to allot for your family so you will not be distracted by
anything else.  That's tough when there is so much to do.  But listen to me
complain.  It's not that bad.  It's all relative.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     A lot of people would trade places with you in a minute.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Sure.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     What do you think you'll do when it's all  over?  Have you thought about
that?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     I don't know.  I've been working on the studio at home and I'm just
ironing out the last few bugs in electronic things.  I'd certainly like to
try my hand at a solo project, which I've been saying for quite some time
now.  We've worked together for so long that it's not easy to just sit down
by yourself and write everything.  There isn't someone to bounce your ideas
off of or to tell you whether it stinks or whether it's a valid idea worth
pursuing.  That's another thing that takes time and patience.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I remember you talked about a solo album.  Did you sort of put that on
hold?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Yeah, it's on hold.  There's just not enough time.  I thought I would
get some work done on it in the summer because we initially planned on having
at least two months, maybe two and a half months, off.  As it turned out,
"Signals" took a month longer.  I got home, I relaxed for the first week.
 The second week started getting hectic and than we went into rehearsals soon
after.  Plus, we did a month here and a month there late last fall.  It was
really hectic getting everything together again, so there was no chance to
work on it then.  When I'm home for a week I try to get downstairs and work
for two or three nights out of the week spending four or five hours after the
kids go to bed.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     You do everything yourself -- all the parts?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Well, so far I am because it's late at night and I'm not really
committed to doing something right now.  They are just rough ideas.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Are you playing anything besides guitar?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Well, the synths are out on the road and when we're off the road I
usually take them home.  Right now I'm using a Roland drum machine and I play
bass and guitar.  When I get the synths back I'll plug them in and give them
a whirl.  Having a studio gives you lots of flexibility, but sometimes it's
distracting because you get hung up on one little sound or one little effect
that you're trying to achieve and you end up spending two or three hours
trying to patch it in the right way.  In that sense it's distracting, so I
try to work on the basic ideas with a Teac 244.  I get a good idea and I can
do some overdubs on it and it gives me something to listen to for awhile.
 Then I can put it down on a multitrack if I want.  I haven't gotten to that
point yet, but a lot of the last album was written like that -- just ideas on
a Portastudio.  Putting down idea after idea and then, for the fun of it,
overdubbing a bass or guitars.  I sort of shelved that when we decided to go
back to work.  We realized that both Geddy and I had done so much work on our
own in the meantime.  Why not use that for the album?  It made writing easier
on this last album.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Do you think that the solo effort, when it comes, will be similar to
what you're doing now or be radically different?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     It's hard to say until you really sit down and do it, until you
formulate some kind of concept.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     You don't have a concept in your head?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     No.  I don't.  But I think probably the single thing that I do have in
mind is something very different.  More a rhythmic kind of new music sort of
vein.  It's hard to say, maybe something a bit jazzy and I'd like to do
songs, proper songs, not a really indulgent kind of guitar album.  That
doesn't really appeal to me.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I think your role in Rush for so long has been a member of the group,
not the guitar player per se.  It is a group -- everyone contributes and
everyone has to gel.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     That's certainly the way I look at it.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Listening to Rory Gallagher tonight -- the band's built around him and
Rory stands there and just tears up the guitar.  That's great, but that's his
way of doing it.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Exactly.  That wouldn't work in the context of this band.  I think it
helps that everyone sort of diversified.  We went into keyboards and a little
more percussion for Neil.  Bass pedals for me.  It shifts the focus a little
on what you're doing and makes it more of a band effort.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Do you think you'll sing on your solo effort?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     I'd love to try.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Are you a shower singer?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     It's kind of weird with me.  I've got excellent pitch I must say.  I can
heart something if it's out of tune even slightly.  I have that ability.
 Even something that's slightly out of tune can be very jarring to my ear.
 But when it comes to singing, I can't get into pitch.  It's just very
difficult for me.  I just don't lock in on it.  Maybe it's a physical
inability.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I've often wondered why over a period of so many albums that Geddy sings
exclusively.  Why hasn't someone else experimented?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     We have.  We've tried.  But it just hasn't worked out.  Maybe in the
future.  Maybe some coaching will help.  Again it's a factor of time.  But
then again, I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to go for two or three weeks during a
summer break or a winter break.  Maybe two or three times a week -- I've got
my studio at home -- go down there, lock the door and practice.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Everytime I see you, you're constantly changing.  I mean personally.
 You're growing, expanding, trying new things.  Maybe singing will be the
next thing.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     It would certainly add another dimension to the band and Geddy wouldn't
mind sharing the load.  I know that.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     You once said, and this is a quote,  "We're not out to be stars.  We're
just out doing what we like doing."  Do you still feel that way?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Oh yeah, that's the way we've always thought about things.  You know us
pretty well, and even though we don't see each other often I think you can
sense that.  With the crew it's family.  It's indicative of the way we feel
about what we do.  Aside from the pressure, the stress and anxiety that are a
part of long tours, we really enjoy what we do and we try to do it the best
we can.  Not so that we end up number one in the polls or go on some kind of
trip.  We just really enjoy what we do, and we're normal people.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Do you consider yourself a star?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     No, the thought embarrasses me.  It's weird, that's my reaction.
 Really, for all of us, the adulation that comes with doing this -- it's
embarrassing at times.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Do you find that you're detached from the adulation?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     I don't know because it has always been like that for us.  I suppose you
can only go by what you see in other bands and how they react to that kind of
thing.  I try to make and effort to be polite and try to take some time and
talk to people, because I know it's important.  It was important to me when I
was in their shoes.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Like it or not, you're now an influence.  There's a certain
responsibility.  You can say screw them, let them buy the records.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Yeah, you do that and people never forget that.  They never forget that
one exchange they had with you.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I think your audience on an average is at an impressionable age.  A lot
of people would categorize your audience as being a little on the restless,
perhaps a little on the violent side.  How do you feel about that?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     I don't know if I really agree with that.  Perhaps in the first few
years that we started getting some kind of notoriety, that was possibly the
case.  But now our audience seems to be subdued but very energetic.  You look
at an audience that goes to a Van Halen concert for instance.  I realize that
there's a cross between our audience and their audience, but on the whole
their audience is much more fired up.  The whole gist of a band like that is
different than what we're about.  With us, I think, possibly our music is a
little more important and people come to see the band play.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     How do you feel about the readers' polls in musicians' magazines?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     It's flattering for one thing, especially in the case of "Guitar
Player," because it really is your peers.  On the other hand, I don't know if
I'm really worthy of that kind of position.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I remember "Guitar World" magazine did you on the cover and said, "Alex
Lifeson -- is he too good for rock?"  Did they tell you they were going to do
that?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Oh, no.  For that I did an interview with John Swenson in the hotel room
and that was that.  I don't think I even knew I would be on the cover of that
particular issue.  That's something they do to catch your eye.  To go back to
polls, with a lot of people you get in a position where you become very
popular and people think, "Yeah, I like that band and that's the guitar
player.  I'll put his name down because he's pretty good."  It's all so
relative.  You go into some bar and you hear a guitar player that makes you
feel guilty that you're not in your room practicing ten hours a day.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Since you don't consider yourself a star, do you consider yourself
successful?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Oh, certainly.  We've considered ourselves successful for a long time.
 It depends on how you measure success.  We felt we were successful for a
long time before we had any kind of financial satisfaction.  We were hundreds
of thousands of dollars in debt.  It was difficult to pay rent but we had
control over what we were doing at least.  We had control over the way we
wanted to project ourselves and in that we found a lot of satisfaction.  It's
nice to have the money but we worked hard for it.  We were quite happy with
what we had before we had any kind of financial success and that's really
only been a fairly recent thing.  It's very difficult when you're touring to
make money.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Just from touring, it's true.  A lot of expenses.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     A lot  of expenses!  You have a crew of thirty people that you're taking
care of and they add up.  If you're not willing to work a lot, then there's
no way you're going to come off the road in the black.  Even though we worked
a lot we had to break a lot of ground for ourselves.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Where haven't you played that you'd like to play?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Japan is one place.  Actually, Japan is about the only place.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Why haven't you played in Japan?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     We just haven't had the time.  It takes us a good six or seven months to
tour in North America.  We have to do Europe for about a month and then a
couple of months off and then recording.  So we haven't been able to get that
together.  Plus, we've gone through some record company changes in Japan.
 It's different to go over and blow a couple hundred thousand dollars doing a
weeks worth of dates there.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Is that all it would be -- a week?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     For our first tour without any kind of record company support.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Does that mean that you're not that strong in Japan as far as record
sales?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     We're not as strong in Japan as we are in North America or England, but
I think that if we went over we could probably do a lot for the tour and
break a lot of ground.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     A lot of groups have taken the reverse philosophy and decided to start
in Japan.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Or go there as a last ditch effort to stay alive.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Are you still allergic to Japanese food?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     I am, but I eat it anyway.  Who cares.  I got a twenty or thirty pound
tuna that my brother-in-law got in Vancouver and brought frozen to Toronto.
 We sliced it up, bought the proper rice and made sushi.  It was fantastic.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     This is a very bourgeois question, but why does the band drink only Dom
Perignon?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     We really don't.  It just happens that we got a deal on Dom and we
bought Dom.  Everybody is very budget conscious this tour and rather than
going through promoters or in-house caterers, we stock our own and eliminate
it from the rider.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     How elaborate is your rider?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Ours is not very elaborate really.  I suppose some promoters would say
it probably is, but ours is quite straight forward.  All we ask for is meals
for the crew; breakfast and lunch when they're loading in; fruit, vegetables,
nuts for us and then after the show some hot hors d'oeuvres.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I've seen some riders where they've asked for a sit-down dinner for
fifty.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     That doesn't happen much anymore.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     When you're on tour are you responsible for any kind of advertising?  As
an example, the last week before you arrived in Washington, two popular rock
stations were both claiming each was the official welcoming station for
 Rush.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     That's totally outside of what we do.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     They claimed they had interviews lined up, etc.  I don't know who
they're interviewing, but I don't think it's the guys in the band.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     No.  I can tell you it's not.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I imagine there was a time in your career when radio stations were
important.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Yeah, they were.  Or at least they were made out to be important to us.
 A lot of times we went to a station and did an interview and they didn't
play any of our songs because we weren't on rotation at that station.  For a
long time we did anything that we had to do and then we made it a policy that
we would only go to stations that supported us.  We went to those stations
for a few tours and now there's just no time, so we don't really do those
types of interviews.  We do some newspaper and telephone interviews.  We
haven't done an interview at a radio station in years.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     On the new album, it seemed that you guys had a baseball theme.  Explain
that to me.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     There's a bar called "The Commons."  It's in an old hotel in Morin
Heights and it is really the only bar in town.  It is a crazy raging place
and in the number of years we've recorded up there we've gotten to know the
people who work at the bar.  They have a girls softball team so when we got
up there they challenged us to a game.  Everybody got baseball gloves -- we
got all set up for this game.  We had a bit of field practice and we played
them a game and we beat them.  Then the guys team offered to play us.  All of
a sudden we got a little too busy.  (Laughs) So it started there and then
when we were doing the credits we thought let's put in everybody's position
from that game, and that's exactly what we did.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     You also mentioned Warren Cromartie, who is a player for the Montreal
Expos.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Warren Cromartie, oddly enough, was really into the band and through
some friends in Montreal called and asked if we'd mind much if he came up to
the studio while we were recording.  So he came up and we met him.  He was
really into the band and we were really into the Expos.  Geddy's a baseball
nut and he was well aware of Warren.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Is he a musician.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Yeah -- he's a pretty good drummer.  Neil, of course, is a great
influence.  He came out on the road with us for a few days in Chicago and St.
Louis and we've become good friends.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Another thing on the album that seemed to be a real influence for you
was the Space Shuttle launch.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Oh, yeah.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I know you flew down there to see it.  It obviously made quite an
impression.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     It was incredible.  We went down there the first day and, of course,
they postponed the launch and we went back down a couple of days later and
watched the launch.  It was an amazing thing -- an amazing sight to witness.
 I've never heard anything so loud in my life.  Your pants are flapping, you
could feel the ground vibrating and this was three miles away.  That's the
closest you could get.  We decided right then that on the next album we'd
like to do something.  We've become good friends with a couple of people at
NASA that have been really helpful.  I think you were here when Gerry Griffin
was down.  I guess it was the last time we were here.  He's a director at
NASA.  They've been very cooperative and quite friendly.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     They've provided you with some excellent footage.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Yes, they did.  It's not easy to get that kind of footage.  It's very
difficult.  I know Carl Sagan had a problem looking for some footage.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Was it just a matter of asking?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Gerry knew that we were writing a song about the space shuttle.  Like I
said he's been very, very cooperative all along the way with any information
that we've wanted from NASA.  Our office approached him about possibly
getting some film and they said, "No problem."  They got it all together and
we had it like that.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     A lot of people have gotten on a waiting list to go on the shuttle.
 Would you go?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     I'd love to.  It would be great.  It is something that can't be written
off because of budget cuts.  It is really an important project.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Are you still flying?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Not as much as I like to.  I haven't flown in about a month.  I'd like
to get my instrument rating but I'd like to be a lot more current on it.  I'd
like to be able to keep it up.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Have you started working on it?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Actually I have about ten or twelve hours instrument time logged on
fairly big twins.  I have some hood time, but I'm not really current on all
that.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     When are you going to start flying the band around?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     That's a heavy responsibility.  At the end of the night you don't really
feel like sitting down and getting your flight plan together.  Plus it takes
a lot out of you and if it is a long three or four flight and you're going
through lousy weather, who wants to really deal with that.  We have the
busses and they're comfortable.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Have either Geddy or Neil flown with you, just the two or three of you?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     No, but they've flown in the aircraft when I've been flying with a
co-pilot.  We flew to St. Catharines once in a Cherokee and we went up to
Neil's and hung out for the day.  When he drove us back to the airport we
said let's go up -- you fly the plane.  He's not too keen on flying.  He flew
the airplane and he really got off on it.  We just flew around for half an
hour and he really enjoyed it, but that's the only time we've ever done
anything like that.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Geddy stays on the ground?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Pretty much.  He's not afraid of flying or anything.  He drives his
turbo.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     What are you driving these days?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Actually, I'm shopping around for an "E" Type.  Something that I can
work on as a project car.  I've always enjoyed doing that.  I've had cars
that I've taken apart and worked on myself.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     The British syndrome.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Yeah, you have to.  I had two MG's that were like that -- constantly
working on them.  But the "E" Type is a very sensuous car.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     You're still not a big German car fan?<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Well, I have two German cars now.  I drive a Mercedes and we have a
second one.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     You told me once you thought the seats were too hard.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Teutonic seats!  I like the car.  It's a great car and extremely
reliable but to get into something that's hot, fast, outside of something
like a Porsche;  I'm not really too keen on Porsches.  I like and respect
them and I admire them, but I don't think I'd want to own one.  It is just a
matter of personal taste.  I've had English cars and I like the smell of the
leather and way they feel and sound.  It's quite different.<p>

     I should probably get going.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     Listen, I really appreciate this.<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Finally we did it -- it was great.  It was just too bad it had to get so
late.  We started getting into some good things.<p>

<b>Harmonix:</b><br>
     I'm going to make you a star Alex!<p>

<b>Alex:</b><br>
     Me?<p>
