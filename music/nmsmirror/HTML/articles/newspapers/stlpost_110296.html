<font size=+1>Rush Lets Music Roar</font><br>
<b>by Chris Dickinson</b><p>

Back in the mid '70s, Rush's futuristic concept album "2112" was a standard
issue platter on every prog-rock fan's turntable.  The Canadian metal-cum-art
rock trio laid the pomposity on thick, and thousands of shag-haired kids jammed
out under the glow of black-light lamps nationwide.<p>

Fast-forward 20 years to the Kiel Thursday night, and all those kids -- 
grown-up now and slightly thicker around the middle -- still cared enough 
about Rush to flick their Bics in unison.  Even many of the young fans in 
attendance looked like '70s throwbacks.<p>

Rock music has gone through many changes since the polyester decade from punk
to new wave to grunge and back to punk again.  For better or worse, Rush has
ignored it all and stayed its own course.  On Halloween night, the band pumped
out big, virtuosic anthems like there was no tomorrow.  And also like it was
still yesterday.<p>

Instead of coming on like sad, rumbling dinosaurs, the members of Rush let
their music roar.  The genre could be dismissed as dated, but what can't be
dismissed is that singer-bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer
Neil Peart are virtuosos.  These three guys have their chops down and know how
to slam it up to the nosebleed section.<p>

Lee, a stratosphere-scraping vocalist once described by Creem magazine as
"Tweety Bird on helium," stood at the mike and proved that years of arena rock
shrieking haven't dulled his edge.  Lee possesses a voice of such high,
freakish dimensions it's impossible to confuse him with anyone else.  Love it,
hate it, but at least give the guy credit for being distinctive.<p>

While Lee opted for a more casual contemporary look (wire-rim shades, jeans,
sneakers), Lifeson's fashion sense seemed frozen in the New Romantics era
(black leather pants, a white modified Jerry Seinfeld pirate shirt).  Peart,
battering away in the center of a sea o' drums, went strictly functional in a
sleeveless T-shirt.<p>

No matter what their dress, the members of Rush stuck firmly to their '70s
roots when it came to the music.  New songs like "Driven," "Limbo" and "Half
the World" carried the trademark stamp of Lee's thick, traveling bass-lines,
Lifeson's powerful chording and nimble harmonics and Peart's muscular 
drumwork.<p>

And no matter how much the new stuff sounded like the old stuff, nothing quite
stacked up to the atmospheric reprise of part of the "2112" album.  As green
laser-beams cut across the arena and thousands of arms punched the air, it was
easy to remember the days when a young band named Rush inspired thousands of
teen-agers to zone out under the glow of the black-light lamp.
