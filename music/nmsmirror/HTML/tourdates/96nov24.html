LONGEVITY PROVES BOTH BLESSING AND CURSE FOR ROCKERS OF RUSH
</font><br>
<strong>by MIKE WEATHERFORD</strong><p>
Technology is relative, Rush seems to be telling us.<p>

From the harnessing of radio waves for the commercial entertainement ("The
spirit of Radio") to cyberspace ("Virtuality"), it's good to go with the
flow and incorporate the changes, but more essential to do something well
that stands free from technological change.<p>

In the case of Canadian power trio Rush, that something is the ability to
consistently furnish rock radio with a distinctive high-octane sound, and
to play it all by themselves when they have to.<p>

And since they don't have to, it means dressing up their now-static sound --
complex "progressive rock" on the edge of heavy metal -- with whatever bells
and whistles come into play as the years go by.<p>

The stage set and vintage video clips for Rush's marathon concert on Sunday
seemed to suggest that today's futurism is tomorow's kitsch.  Art deco
"space age" prop pieces suggested a long-forgotten world's fair where
optimism and faith in the future prevailed.<p>

Adding satellite dishes to the stage clutter and familiar vidoe images to
the cinema-size rear screen (O.J. Simpson, Bill Clinton, etc.) when the
band launched its second set with the new "Test for Echo", suggests that
optimism has been replaced by a cynism that technology and information
aren't really leading us anywhere (Test for Echo").<p>

And fans on Sunday could be alittle cynical when Rush could give us
movie-quality front-projection video and surround sound from speakers hung
over the back of the audience, yet still could'nt deliver a clean,
articulate sound from the fortress os speakers that blasted the audience
from above the stage.<p>

The muddy mix made it hard to find any range in Geddy Lee's familiar yelp;
though he was reportedly ill enough to almost cancel the show, what you
could hear sounded like the same duable voice we've been used to for more
than 20 years.<p>

Longevity is the band's blessing and curse.  It has the option of packing a
show with nothing but favorites or new songs, which seemed to come off with
more energy than they do on the new album.<p>

Yet, going so long without major change brings a certain static level to
the show; so many of the new songs sound like the old ones, with only the
technical effects to liven them up.  And having to play to a "click track"
to phase in so many of the audio and visual effects took some punch out of
songs that othewise would find their own pace live.<p>

On the other hand, synthesized drum effects made Neil Peart's solo the most
entertainning drum solo in years, and, coming after a funky, "Miami
Vice"-style instrumental, a rare moment when the band let a little rhythm
creep into its mechanic, heavily technical style.<p>

Otherwise there were precious few moments when the band felt free to loosen
up, such as adding "Wipe Out" to the end of "Big Money", and their
now-standard reggae flameout to the end of "Closer to the Heart".  And some
songs still sound timeless like the best of prog-rock: "Red Barchetta" and
"Freewill" among them.<p>

But you have wonder how long Rush keeps planning on doing this, and whether
an aging audience suggests they've lost the influx of young people that
keeps them in the arenas instead of smaller venues.<p>

Fans have to hope the band as a whole becomes like the 1968 film "2001: A
Space Odyssey" (thus "Spake Zarathustra" opened the show) or their own 1976
sci-fi opus, "2112", which drew a huge crowd reaction: Dated but still
worthy and lovable in their own ways.<p>
