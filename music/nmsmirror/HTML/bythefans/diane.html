A modern day woman<br>
mean mean glare<br>
Today's Diane Sawyer<br>
all over the air<p>

Though her questions all have slant<br>
don't consider her arrogant<br>
Her attack, a probing sting<br>
gets to the heart of everything<br>
The interview<p>

What she sees in the people she meets<br>
is what you see of our society<br>
-Gets the stories- gets the grit<br>
-probes the issue- get a grip<p>

The show is, the show is<br>
on at ten o'clock<br>
Maybe you should watch Prime Time Live<p>

Today's Diane Sawyer<br>
she gets high on news<br>
In the lives she invades<br>
she finds the truth<p>

No the show is not a hit<br>
nobody really watches it<br>
Always trite, if not pertinent<br>
The ratings it just doesn't get<br>
The ratings<p>

What she says in her news report<br>
is the only way that the truth comes forth<br>
-conceal the witness- a biting wit<br>
-seek the truth- what the hell, go fish<p>

Exit the reporter<br>
Today's Diane Sawyer<br>
she gets high on news<br>
and the tricks of the trade<br>
Gets right on to<br>
the issues of the day.<p>
