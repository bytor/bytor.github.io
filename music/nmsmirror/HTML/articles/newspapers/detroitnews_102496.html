<font size=+1>Listeners will be quick to lose interest in Rush</font><br>
<b>by Tom Long</b><p>

Canadian rockers Rush made the transition from maybe-metal
to commercial-progressive quite a while back, and it has certainly
worked in terms of sales over the band's past two decades. Rush,
who plays the Palace at Auburn Hills on Friday, is a consistent
platinum player, and its latest CD, Test for Echo, is firmly
ensconced near the top of the charts these days.<p>

Problem is, Rush's idea of progressive isn't terribly forward
looking. Anything on Test for Echo could have been recorded in 1973 by the 
almost forgotten Uriah Heep. This is not progress, this is bad taste with 
staying power.<p>

Not that the three geezers who comprise Rush aren't fine musicians. Singer-bass 
player Geddy Lee has toned his pop-your-eyeballs-out screech down to an almost 
folky tenor, and guitarist Alex Lifeson lays an efficient mix of lines and 
chords over drummer Neil Peart's busy thumping. Polished players all.<p>

But the songs here strain to make statements about the modern condition while 
exhibiting the depth of a puddle. And much of the time the musical changes 
scream "This is impressive" when in fact they are fairly mundane.<p>

The album is perhaps epitomized by the absurd "Dog Years," wherein Lee cries 
out the chorus Dog Years - it's the season of the itch with operatic fervor 
over a storm of rousing instrumentation as if this is something powerfully 
affecting. Honest, it's not.<p>

Lee gets off some good lines, most notably in "Half the World" (Half the world 
hates what half the world does every day), but Rush spends so much time trying 
to be heavy it undercuts what few fine moments it can come up with. <p>

This music obviously works for 15-year-old boys hiding from homework with the 
headphones on. It has worked in that way for a long time now, and perhaps 
there's value in that (there's certainly money in it). But others encountering 
Rush will likely find themselves in a rush to turn the stereo off.<p>
