<font size=+1>Visuals spectacular for magical Rush</font><br>
<b>by Dina Williams</b><p>

It was Theater of the Large -- and like the tiny Lilliputians, a worshipful Rush
audience found a Gulliver Saturday night at the Knickerbocker Arena, one that
was gargantuan compared to everyday life.<p>

Rush, known for its experimentation and technical innovations, particularly
drummer Neil Peart's percussion, fulfilled expectations with hits spanning the
band's 15-year career as well as several from their recent album "Presto." <p>

The evening's theme was magic, and for the devotees who packed the Knick to
its rafters, Merlin couldn't have done better than the Canadian trio.<p>

A pair of giant, dancing rabbits popped out of enormous top hats. A laser show
danced over the stage and into the arena's far corners. "The Midget Magicians"
transformed from a drawing to an animated cartoon into elaborate film footage.<p>

The visuals were spectacular, but the focus of the evening was on the band's
lyrically and instrumentally finely-crafted songs.<p>

Peart's drumming was in fine form, especially during his solo on "YYZ." Alex
Lifeson kept up the pace with precise guitar gymnastics and bassist Geddy Lee
agrressively stretched the range of his instrument. His distinctive, 
high-pitched vocals topped with "On the Past," a song about teen suicide from 
"Presto."<p>

Peart's literary lyrics often probe how society smothers young people's
individuality and potential, but with optimism -- hope for their ability to
overcome obstacles and change the world.<p>

This grandiose theme and numerous lengthy instrumentals eventually wore thin.
Rush hit its stride, though, with several songs from "Presto" before their
encores.<p>

"Show Me, Don't Tell Me" was a highlight, ironically expressing a desire for
communication without hocus-pocus.<p>

Mr. Big played a mighty metal set to open that was heavy on the Spandex,
meaty guitar solos and power vocals.<p>

The line-up consists of formerly Buffalo-based Talas and David Lee Roth
bassist Billy Sheehan (who could have used more volume); ex-Racer X guitarist
Paul Gilbert; one-time Robert Plant drummer Pat Torpey and former solo
vocalist Eric Martin
