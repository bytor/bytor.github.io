SW: Now into their third decade of making music together, those are the
unmistakable sounds of Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart, better known
as Rush. Welcome to the world premiere of the brand new Rush album,
_Counterparts_. I'm Steve Warden, coming to you from Rush's home town of
Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Over the course of the next two hours, in addition
to hearing this very powerful new album, you'll be treated to a first for one
of these radio album launch deals -- exclusive commentary by all three
members of the band, including as a special fall bonus, Geddy Lee's
championship baseball prognostications. Stick around, we'll get started with
Rush right after this.

SW: Welcome back to Toronto. I'm Steve Warden, and this is the world premiere
of _Counterparts_, the brand new album from Rush. In the last few weeks, over
a couple of separate interview sessions, I had a chance to spend some time
with Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart, and as we go through the album,
you'll hear various comments from all three; some of them surprising, some 
hilarious, all of them revealing in one way or another. 
<P>
We begin with Geddy Lee's assessment of the sonic direction the band chose for
_Counterparts_, an almost deliberate move back to capturing the basics of
bass, guitar and drums.
<P>
GL: It was about as deliberate as we ever get. When we start making a record,
we really don't know what the hell we're gonna do; we just go in, and just see
what starts coming out. I think there's been a few frustrations, in retrospect,
over the last couple records. Not in the material, and certainly not in the
quality of the songwriting and performances, but mostly in a sonic thing. <P>

I think there were a few tracks on the last record that the style of
production that we used suited very well. And there were other few tracks that
seemed in the final result when we wanted them to kick a bit more, to have
a bit more power, it really wasn't there to get out of the tracks. And I think
that stuck in the back of our minds, and throughout the tour hearing those
songs live, and feeling how much more power they had live, 'cause I think about
three of the tracks on the last record just sounded, at least to us, really
killer live. And we thought, "Hm ... we're not capturing one element of our
band. There's some element that we do, that is natural to the way we play, and
it comes out live, that we're not grabbing on record these days." <P>

So it was a concerted effort to grab that, and we wanted a complete change of 
scenery, complete change of engineers, production, everything. And even though 
we interviewed a lot of young producers, and talked to -- got so many people
to work with on this record, we turned to Peter Collins in the end, who we had
worked with before, for a couple of reasons: number one being the fact that he
is very much a different producer now than he was when we worked with him
last. We've always been friends, and we've always had a great respect for his
way of doing things, but since working with us last he's worked with a lot
more American bands: Queensryche, and so on. And we felt he was different
producer now, with the same priorities, which we liked. And talking to him it
was kind of like an instant, "Let's do this record together" as soon as we
talked. We knew it would be great, so, and he agreed with the vision of what
we saw; and his comments, criticizing the last couple records, sonically
anyway, were very much in line with the direction we wanted to go, and we
thought, "Bingo! Here you go, this is what we need." <P>

SW: And then you introduced in a different element in the engineering side.  <P>

GL: Yeah, and we decided, "Well, what do you wanna do for an engineer?" 'Cause
when we worked with Peter Collins last, he was kinda teamed up with Jim
Barton, who has since gone on to be a producer in his own right, and a very
good one. So it was kind of like, "Who do you work with these days?" And he
goes, "Well, I work with lots of different people." And so we sat down to kind
of a laborious but interesting search, and we had tapes from, you know,
producers from all over the world -- I mean engineers from all over the world
that we were listening to just for a sound. And in the end we settled on this
"caveman" character: his name is Kevin "The Caveman" Shirley, and he's a South
African by way of Australia, whose tape was really raw, and it had a very 
natural sound to it. And we thought, "This is good. Let's get this raw 
attitude in the bed tracks and primary stages of recording and let's bring
someone different in to mix it that maybe has a different, and a bit more of a
sophisticated flair; a bit more of a high-tech attitude." <P>

So we were after the best of both worlds. And from my point of view, it worked
a treat. We brought Michael Letho from Australia to mix it, and I think he
was great -- both guys were great. So it was a very happy marriage and I'm
really pleased with the result.  <P>

SW: Did you see it as a bit of a risk though? <P>

GL: Yeah, it was a bit of a risk. But you know, when you've made records for
the many years that we have, you do have a certain confidence that you'll be
able to pull it out. There are risks, but you know what the risks really are.
And there were a few times we were going, "I don't know about this, some of
these sounds are pretty raw." But we just had confidence that it would all
work out, and thankfully it did.  <P>

SW: Was it also kind of challenging yourselves? You know, you mentioned having
made so many records. Is it just something that you had arrived at, it was
like, "Let's just try this, and maybe trigger something in us that we may not
otherwise get"? <P>

GL: Absolutely correct. I think the hidden benefit of working with someone
like Kevin was that he challenged all our conceptions, all our ideas about how
to make records. He questioned them, he said, "Well why do it this way?" You
know, he's a kind of character that had very little respect for a lot of music
that's been made, and a lot of ways people make records; a highly critical
character. And I think that was good to have that element in the room. You
had to keep it to a check, to a certain point, you didn't want to suddenly be
involved in a very cynical, critical way of making records. But, I think
having someone that challenges you to make sure you're doing things the way
you should be doing them is great. <P> 

He is from a school of engineering that doesn't believe in grabbing bags of 
EQ, and tweaking this knob, and tweaking that one. To him, it's "Well, your
instrument sounds good out there. Let's get the right mikes and let's record
it. And if there's a problem with the sound, more likely it's a problem out
there with the source of the sound, as opposed to trying to fix a bad source."
And there was a lack of complacency that was great; he was fired up, he was
energetic, and I think we found that quite infectious, kind of carried over.
<P>
   [ "Between Sun And Moon" is played ]
<P>
SW: "Between Sun And Moon" -- that's Rush from their brand new album
_Counterparts_. And we have more to come in just a moment.
<P>
   [commercial break]
<P>
SW: Welcome back to the world premiere of the brand new Rush album,
_Counterparts_. I'm your host Steve Warden in Toronto. Time now to meet
drummer/lyricist Neil Peart. He's normally the most reticent member of the
band when it comes to publicity, but always a true gentleman, who provides
incredible insight into this band's creative process. Now on the last record
_Roll The Bones_, Neil explored the concept of chance; so I asked him what was 
on his mind this time around.  <P>

NP: _Roll The Bones_ as you outlined had the element of chance as a theme, and
that was when I starting thinking about it, and just grew, and so many
elements of chance appealed to me and inspired me to write about them. So
_Roll The Bones_ had that concept in common. This record didn't really have
that; it was a selection of individual themes that I didn't really associate
at the time. I was thinking certainly about gender differences, and I've been
reading Jung so I was interested in the anima, the female spirit within the
male, etc. <P>

So that intrigued me, and the "Nobody's Hero" idea -- I'd been thinking a lot 
about the nature of heroism and what was good and what was bad about it, and 
the idea of a role model, and people I'd known in my own life who were
important to me as influences but weren't important to the rest of the world.
So that concept of a role model but not a hero, if you like. So that was one
separate set of influences, and all these things I really saw, and to
some extent still see, as quite separate themes -- duality became the only
unifying theme, hence _Counterparts_, but there really wasn't a germ as chance
was in _Roll The Bones_ that sent me on a unified quest.  <P>

SW: So in the beginning then, in starting to put the songs together, is that
okay that things are disparate, or do you try to find a thread? <P>

NP: No, no, the thread is entirely accidental almost always. Albums like _Power
Windows_ or _Hold Your Fire_ it was completely accidental; after the fact I
went back and realized that, well, I've been writing these songs lyrically 
over the same period of time, so it wasn't surprising that I was on the same
fixations. And I look at my notebook of collected scraps and ideas for a
period of a year or two, and I notice threads. And that is so helpful, because
when I do sit down on lyric-writing day, I find the threads and I say, "Okay,
I was thinking about that six months ago, and then last week, and those two
ideas I'll stitch together." So it tends to happen very naturally and step by
step like that, and only really in the final analysis most times, can you see
what the associations might have been. <P>

So this time I remember the earlier songs that I started on lyrically were the
"Speed Of Love", for instance, I was caught on that phrase and interested in
writing more songs about love rather than songs of love. And "Nobody's Hero"
is one of the earliest ones, 'cause again that was a theme of my thinking over
the last two years, and many conversations with friends around the country and
so on; you get talking about the nature of heroism. So that was one that just
was a growing crystal, I guess, over a year and a half or two years, and then
the song was fairly bursting with input by then.  <P>

SW: Why had you been thinking about heroes and heroism? <P>

NP: From so many things. What I mentioned before whether or not it's good, you
know, the idea of having heroes. For a lot of young people if their heroes are
in sports, or in the entertainment world, they tend to be sold and bought as
perfect. Hollywood, I think, probably invented the idea of demigods and the
deity of an actress or the deity of an actor. And then sports took it over
too, and the sports deities until they get old or sick or whatever, they
are superhuman. And that seems like all very well and doesn't really hurt
anybody, and maybe it inspires young people, but I kind of think it's
discouraging too. Because when you're growing up, you're painfully aware of 
your flaws and your limitations, and I think perhaps you can feel too distant 
from any ideal of perfection. <P>

A role model is to me the opposite of a hero, in a sense, or a counterpart if 
you like, in the sense of the definition of counterpart is both duplicate and 
opposite. It's one of the reasons why I was intrigued by the word so much. So 
a role model is good, because there's no aspect of deity or superhuman 
perfection about it, it's just, "That's the direction I want to go and here's 
a person doing it the way I'd like to do it." I thought that was a lot more 
healthy, and also the nature of heroism, again something I've touched on
before in songs like "Limelight" and even more recently in "Superconductor",
was the nature of fame and how it affects the people in it. I've been
involved, of course, in that world for a long time, and watching other people
affected by the nature of fame and the nature of that kind of deification. 
And it really isn't healthy for them either, so I started thinking, "Well maybe 
this idea of modern, 20th century western world heroism really isn't so good."
<P>
So, that was part of the thinking, and like I say, one idea is never really
enough, so I had the other concept of people that had been significant enough
in my own life to merit, almost the idea of heroism, to me. They had changed
my life and prevented me maybe, in the case of the first person "nobody's
hero" for instance, about the first gay person I ever knew, who was such a
great role model, and almost occupies a heroic space in my life, because he
prevented me from ever being homophobic or for thinking there was something
sick or unnatural about it; because I just knew him, and worked with him when
I lived in London, and went to his parties and it was all just very casual,
and I guess I was young enough not to be already prejudiced, so he occupied an
important part of my life. And then as the song dictates, we fell apart
geographically -- drifted apart, rather -- and then when I found out that he 
had died of AIDS it was like this hole had been left, and yet at the same
time, this glowing example had been set by him. So, it's certainly not like
his life was in vain, but his heroism was in a very small arena.
<P>
   [ "Nobody's Hero" is played ]
<P>
SW: "Nobody's Hero", from the brand new Rush album _Counterparts_. As most
Rush fans probably know, drummer Neil Peart supplies the words, while Geddy
Lee and Alex Lifeson sculpt the sound. And in the case of _Counterparts_,
sculpting the sound meant showing off the goods of this very intense, very
very impressive power trio, with lots of rock and roll guitar right up front.
And it was a concept that Alex Lifeson had no trouble warming up to.  <P>

AL: This is something that we discussed on the last tour a number of times;
about having a focus more on the three-piece, and kind of recapturing some of
the energy that we used to feel as a tighter three-piece unit I think, before
we brought keyboards into a more predominant role in the picture of our music.
Certainly the style of recording that Kevin Shirley, who was the recording
engineer, used was very very direct, and captured the least amount of
resistance from the speakers to the tape machine. It was just a matter of
plugging into the amp and miking it; I wasn't really encumbered by any
effects, we got into some things later, but certainly for the bulk of the
guitars and for all the bed tracks, it was just straight ahead. <P>

I sat in a studio for the first time in 12 years and recorded guitars out
there, which I've always stayed away from, figuring that in the control room
you have a sense of control. There's immediate communication; if you want the
monitors down they can go down, if you want them up they can go up. So, I
really wasn't into doing it, but Kevin talked me into it. And after a couple
of days of getting used to it, it was great! You could feel the wood of the
guitar vibrating against your body, and it was more susceptible to that really
cool feedback, and it was your own little world; it was a little bit of an
escape. I don't think I'd go back now.  <P>

GL: Can I ask you a question? <P>

AL: Yeah.  <P>

GL: Did you actually say, "encumbered by effects"? <P>

AL: Yes, Ged, believe it or not I actually said that.  <P>

GL: Did you actually say that phrase, or have you been possessed by some sort
of logical devil? <P>

AL: I've matured a lot in the last couple of months.  <P>

GL: Say Hallelujah! <P>

AL: You know something, you get into a particular way of doing things, and
it's very comfortable, and you get a little resistant to change sometimes,
especially when it comes to sound of a guitar. I mean, I like to think this is
my own particular sound, one that I've developed over a number of years. For
that reason alone it's time to change it; you know, and mix it up a bit. And I
have been very resistant to this kind of an approach to recording the guitar; 
I always thought that we could get power and size and tonal depth in a number
of other ways. But, I have to say that after doing it this way, there's only
one way to get a really great electric guitar sound, and that is to plug the
thing into the amp and turn it up. And the shortest distance from the guitar
to the amp is the best and the most effective.  <P>

GL: This is not the guy I've known for the last 10 years. I don't know who
this imposter is, but get him out of this control room! <P>

AL: Doh! <P>

GL: You are a liar! Fake! Impostor! <P>

SW: When you say that you wanted to get back to a more kind of simplistic, you
know, bass-guitar-drums trio sound. You talked a little bit about that on _Roll
The Bones_ as well. Do you think it's been kind of a gradual process? <P>

AL: I think so, we've certainly aimed for it, but ...  <P>

GL: Yeah, but I think as Alex was saying, so much is do with a style, and
the way the engineer hears things, and like we were talking about earlier,
there are a number of songs that are kind of more subtle, and more textured on
_Roll The Bones_ I think required the kind of production they had, but there 
are other songs that really, I think, the style of the song and the style of 
production were not in sync. And the way that Alex had described recording 
these instruments was more in keeping, I think, with the spirit of some of the 
ways that we have been writing in the last few years.  <P>

SW: What were you doing on "Double Agent"? There's that kind of ...  <P>

GL: We were losing our minds, is what we were doing! "Double Agent" was a
complete exercise in self-indulgence, and really, it was one of the last
things we wrote on the record, and we just kind of -- we'd written all these
songs that were heavily structured, and, you know, were crafted and
meticulously worked on: this note and that note, and this is a song we just
wanted to kind of get our yah-yahs out and just have a bit of a rave. And
really, it's one of the goofiest songs I think we've ever written, but I'm
quite happy with the result. In its own way, I think it's an interesting
little piece of lunacy.  <P>

   [ "Double Agent" is played ]
<P>
SW: Rush, "Double Agent". And we'll continue with the world premiere of
_Counterparts_ in just a moment.
<P>
   [commercial break]
<P>
SW: Welcome back to _Counterparts_, the world album premiere with Rush. I'm
Steve Warden. The next song we're going to hear is "Animate" -- a song that
makes excellent use of some wicked Geddy Lee bass guitar. As Geddy told me,
they employed some unusual equipment to get the bass sound that they were
after.
<P>
GL: We set up the gear I had in the studio, and The Caveman went in there, and
he looked at all this high-tech gear and he said, "You know, I saw this old
beat-up amp head that was lying in the corner yesterday. Do you mind if we
plug that in?" So we dragged it out, and this is literally an amp that was
found in the garbage that one of the assistants at Le Studio had repaired -- 
it was an old tube amp, and plugged it in to all these speakers we had, and he
turned it up to like, 15, and the thing was like ... I thought it was going to
explode. So, we used a combination: my regular DI setup, my regular setup, and
plus this exploding amp setup, and you know, he made it happen. It sounded
great, I had a tremendous amount of energy, and all the explosion sounds of it
kind of disappeared in the track, so you're not really aware of the fact that
it's an amplifier on the verge of death. But what you are aware of is the
power that's coming out of the speaker, so that was a great benefit.
<P>
SW: We'll hear Geddy Lee's driving bass guitar sound in just a moment on the
song "Animate" -- but first, Neil Peart on the song itself. It's a track that
not only displays Rush's awesome musicianship, but also delves into the
duality theme that was on Neil's mind.
<P>
NP: I hope that it's going to be clear that it's about one person. It's set up
on purpose a little bit vague to sound like it might be about a relationship
between two people, and almost a love song in a sense. But, that became such a
cliche certainly through the '80s, of the modern sensitive man, and it was
wrong in many ways. I draw upon my research, if you like, on this, everywhere
from Carl Jung to Camille Paglia, about what the modern man was supposed to be.
And to many people in the '80s, the modern man was supposed to be a woman, and
you know, to be sensitive and nurturing, and all, and to completely lose the
masculine side of the character, the "animus". So, just in the reading about
that and the thinking about that, and observing certainly people around me,
and how they behave and how the pretended to be ... how they pretended they
really were, and so on. It became a bit of an act of men pretending to be more
sensitive than they actually were, and sometimes women pretending to be more
aggressive than they actually were. 
<P>
So, it was basically pleading for a balance of that; I feel that, yes, men do 
have a large female component to their characters, as it can only be. It's 
natural, again as counterparts we are both duplicates and opposites. The Oxford 
dictionary definition of the word includes both of those things. So, that's
definitely true of genders as well, and in the song I was trying to get at the
idea of that you can be both strong and sensitive; you can be both ambitious
and soft, really, but not to deny either and to keep them in balance. So the
dominance and submission metaphor had to come into play, but I used it again
of a person dominating himself, in this case, because it's a man. He's
dominating his softer side, but at the same time he also has to dominate his
"a" words -- the aggression, and the ambition, and the traditional biological
male things, which in spite of all modern sociological changes, we are in the
last 20 or 30 years of sexual revolution, trying to change tens of thousands
of years of human evolution: really, men as the hunter and woman as a
nurturer. 
<P>
So, those things have to be recognized, and yes we can change them, we've 
changed a lot of things. You know, we used to be comfortable with slavery and 
call ourselves Christians; that's changed now. There are definitely changes we 
can make in acting more civilized, but at the same time it's foolish to deny 
that which courses through our veins. So the song really tries to reconcile 
that very complicated and also very topical thing.
<P>

SW: "Animate" -- that's Rush from _Counterparts_. And we'll be back with more
of the world album premiere right after this.

<P>
SW: Continuing now with the world premiere of the latest Rush album
_Counterparts_, I'm Steve Warden.  Now before anybody gets too hung up on the
suggestive aspects of the song "Stick It Out", maybe a little clarification
from lyricist Neil Peart might be in order.
<P>
NP: It's just a play on the words, really. "Stick It Out" meaning both a
kind of arrogant display, "stick it out", but also the endurance thing; if
you have a difficult thing to endure, stick it out and you get to the end. It
was the pun on both of those, really, so again the duality in the song is a
bit leaning both ways. The sense of forbearance, of holding back, and also
the idea of fortitude: stick it out, you know, survive. But that was more of
a piece of fun, that song I would say, both lyrically and musically it verges
on parody, and that was one I think we just had fun with, and lyrically I
certainly did, too. "Stick it out" and "spit it out" and all that was just a
bit of word play.
<P>
   [ "Stick It Out" is played ]
<P>
SW: "Stick It Out", the first single from the new Rush album _Counterparts_,
and this is the world premiere of that album coming to you from the studios of
Q-107 in Rush's home town of Toronto, Canada. I'm Steve Warden.
<P>
Now given the heavy nature of the material on this album, I asked Geddy Lee if
that had any great effect on how he approached his vocals on this recording.
<P>
GL: Well, our style of writing has changed a lot over the years, particularly
the last few years. We seem to be serving the melody of the song -- by that I
mean, in the past our songs were mostly instrumentals that had vocals on top
of them. And now they're very much songs written around lyric and vocal
melody, and the instrumentation serves that. The instrumentation supports the
melody, supports the feeling and the mood of the lyric. So, in a sense the
music is slave to the vocals and to the lyric, which I think is very
appropriate for where we seem to be at at the moment. For a lot of reasons I
think it leaves me far more range as a singer. It gives me much more emotion
to play with so that I can write a melody first, sitting there, which is bass
and vocals and a lyric sheet in front of me, and I'll keep working on that
until I get off on it. There's a particular feedback I look for now when I'm
writing a vocal melody, and if I'm getting that feedback, I'm getting a charge
out of singing it, then I feel like I'm on the right track, and with the rest
of instrumentation we then try to take that feeling and expand upon it.
<P>
   [ "Everyday Glory" is played ]
<P>
SW: Rush and "Everyday Glory" from _Counterparts_. Some of the most
interesting comments that drummer Neil Peart had to make when we spoke, had
to do with the new bands on the scene today and the return of a more organic,
stripped-down approach to making music. I asked him if Rush has been
influenced at all by the new rock of the 1990s.
<P>
NP: We always respond to the times around us. Through the '70s, we were
definitely influenced by new wave music and by the ska and reggae influences
on pop music of the time, even into the electronic dance music and the new
romantic music of the early '80s. All of that found its way into our music,
and world music throughout the '80s found its way into our music, too. And we
are a sponge and we don't try to hide that. We're perfectly open to new
influences all the time and love them, and love being inspired by them. In 
this case, yes, we are reacting to the times around us, but only in the most 
healthy and honest way of saying, "Okay, we're going forward with our evolution 
-- which does tend to be a pretty straight road, but that doesn't mean that we 
aren't drawing in traffic from the side roads beside us."  
<P>
Certainly we didn't feel so alone suddenly as a guitar-rooted band, and
playing real drums. In the '80s, just from a drumming point of view, again
it was getting kind of worrisome, because everything you heard on the radio
was programmed drums -- however well done -- and all the records were using
sampled. If there was a real drummer playing it was a sampled snare drum and
a sampled bass drum, and there was no technique being demonstrated at all.
Drums were well relegated to the background in the '80s, even in so-called
rock music of the time was really light metal. It was programmed as could be
in both senses of the word, musically programmed and also radio programmed.
<P>
So, it was worrisome and I started thinking, "What's happening to the real
drummers?" All the young guys that are playing through the '80s and learning
and that, they have nowhere to play and no bands to play in I'm sure, unless
they're in bar bands or something, because the atmosphere precludes it right
now. And then suddenly in the '90s all these bands were coming out. Matt
Cameron from Soundgarden was suddenly here -- here's a great drummer, and Dave
Krusen from Pearl Jam -- suddenly a great drummer, and this band Live from
the States, a drummer called Chad Gracy, again playing great drums. Somehow,
they weathered that time and came out of it with a fresh message for drumming
in the '90s. That was really kind of affirming to me, too, just from the craft 
of drumming alone, even apart from being a member of Rush.
<P>
And as a band I think, yes, we were really feeling isolated through the '80s;
because of that, we were one of the only rock bands out there playing real
instruments and playing rock songs in front of rock audiences, so there was a
sense of maybe being alone, and a bit even of an anachronism, but then when
those bands would come out, and yes they would say in interviews, "Yeah, we
grew up listening to Rush." That was such an affirmation, just such a spark
of "Yay, we're not alone" and there's no generational or age factor there now
because we're both bands, making records and doing tours in all of these
cases, so there isn't really a divide. We've been doing it longer, yes, but
we do have the same values. Those bands are concerned about playing well,
about getting better, about writing good songs in interesting ways and being
original, and all those concerns are exactly the ones we've always stood for,
so it's like the torch has been passed.  Everything's good.

SW: Hi, I'm Steve Warden and we're back now with _Counterparts_, the world
album premiere from Rush. We're joined by Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil
Peart, and at this point we have the instrumental track from the album queued
up -- it's called "Leave That Thing Alone". Now Rush fans will probably make a
connection between this song and "Where's My Thing?", the instrumental
tour de force that was on the band's last album _Roll The Bones_. But as Alex
and Geddy told me, there really isn't much of a connection between the two
songs.
<P>
GL: Only that the fact that they both have "things" in the title.
<P>
AL: Yeah, and they're on our records.
<P>
GL: The "things" are different things.
<P>
AL: It's not the same thing.
<P>
GL: It's not the same thing. Really, you have to say, "It's just not the same
thing."
<P>
AL: No, no ... it's just a ... thing.
<P>
GL: It's a different thing.
<P>
AL: A totally different thing.
<P>
GL: Yeah.
<P>
AL: It's some thing though, it's ...
<P>
SW: So how did we end up with another instrumental?
<P>
AL: Oh, they're so much fun to do.
<P>
GL: Yeah, they're fun; it's like recess; it's like somebody blew a whistle,
let's do an instrumental! Yeehah!
<P>
AL: They're very spontaneous, they get written quickly, the ideas go down very
very quickly, and the nice thing about this particular instrumental is that
there's a tendency to be very flashy when you do an instrumental; it's your
kind of a release to be a show-off. But I think on this song, the melodies are
very very strong, and there's something that touches you more emotionally.
<P>
GL: Yeah, I think this is one of our best ones; I'm really happy with this
one.
<P>
AL: Yeah, I like listening to it.
<P>
GL: From two points of view, as Alex said, the chorus melodies, especially the
guitar melody, I think is beautiful. I think no matter what style of music you
want to call it, I think it's a great melody. But the other thing that I like 
about it is the rhythmic attitude of it, which is very different for us, and
it's an area we keep playing around with and experimenting with, and learning
how -- "how do white Canadians learn to play funk music?" These are continuing
experiments in that area, even though it's not funk music by any funk player's 
standards, for us it's got more of that rhythmic attitude, which is a lot of
fun to do. And sometimes I think it comes in reaction to having written tense,
very structured, meticulously put together songs, and here we are at the end
of that, we're going, "Let's just have some fun! You know, let's bring these
riffs together." And we always have a riot when we put these down.
<P>
AL: We kind of feel sorry for Neil 'cause he's not really included. We don't
even let him in, actually, when we're working on those things. We give it to 
him and that's it.
<P>
GL: But then he gets to have his stab at it, and usually there's two or three
suggestions that he will have that will change the arrangement a bit here and
there, so he gets his turn, but he has to work alone, so it's not as much
fun.
<P>
AL: And then he wrecks it with the drums.
<P>
GL: Yeah, that! That's the other thing.
<P>
AL: There's the other thing with all our songs.
<P>
GL: Oh yeah, there's the other thing.
<P>
   [ "Leave That Thing Alone" is played ]
<P>
SW: "Leave That Thing Alone" -- that's Rush from the new album _Counterparts_.
Now unlike that song, our next track, "Speed Of Love", features words. And not
only that, but they're words written by someone other than Neil Peart. It's a
rare collaboration between Neil and his old pal, Pye Dubois. 
<P>
[ Ed. Note: The song should be "Between Sun and Moon" and *NOT* "Speed of
Love".  The interviewer was incorrect. ]
<P>
NP: Yeah, in the past, "Tom Sawyer" of course was cowritten with Pye, and
"Force 10" on _Hold Your Fire_ was too, and I really like his style of
writing. It's inscrutable to me, sometimes, as I think it is to other people
too, but at the same time it has a certain power in his images and writing.
And also, there was some strange symbiosis that seemed to affect the songs;
when Pye was involved in "Tom Sawyer" and in "Force 10", it made them somehow a
little different musically, you know, his percolation through me. I would get
his ideas and then I would add mine to them and structure it as a Rush song,
and then pass it along to the other guys. Even through that chain of events,
somehow there was some outside influence that was good, so we've always kind
of kept the open door to Pye's ideas. Anytime he had anything to submit he
would send it along to me, usually scrawled in an exercise book. And in this
case that was one that we all responded to some of the images in his
presentation, so again I went to work on it, shaped it up into the kind of
structure that we like to work with, and then added some of my own images and
angles on it. And so it went.
<P>
SW: And is that something you enjoy just as a change of pace? Having another
input?
<P>
NP: Yeah, I'm a happy collaborator really. Obviously we couldn't have stayed
together, the three of us, for 20 years if we weren't happy collaborating, and
it's the same way lyrically. I do like working with someone else, as long as
they're equally open about it. I'm always concerned with Pye, "Do you think
I'm wrecking up your work?" because theoretically when he finishes it, he
thinks it's done. So, if I come in and start changing things around, and 
adding and subtracting things, it could seem a bit presumptuous, I guess, so
I'm always concerned about his feelings on that. But he seems comfortable with
it too, so it's just like he said, it's just turning out a good tune that
counts, that's what matters to him. So, it's just a nice thing to do, to have
somebody else's input. I've done it in the past even with Geddy and Alex, who
put ideas together in words, and the song called "Chemistry" on _Signals_ was
like that. They just wrote down a bunch of images and ideas and gave them to
me, and I stitched them all together into an organized thing. So that's always
a kind of a fun way to work; I like that.

Tommy Nast: Album Network's world premiere of _Counterparts_ from Rush will
continue in just a moment.
<P>
   [commercial break]
<P>
SW: Welcome back to the world premiere of the brand new Rush album
_Counterparts_. I'm your host Steve Warden in Toronto. If the first half of
this album is "in your face aggressive", the second half seems to be for the
most part more melodic. Geddy Lee told me that it was a real challenge to
organize the order of the songs on this record _Counterparts_.
<P>
GL: I think this was one of the hardest records to sequence that we've ever put
together. It was much easier in the old days when you had two sides, and now
that you have one side, boy it's really tough. Alex made this most
magnificent ...
<P>
AL: Oh, please!
<P>
GL: ... artistic creation, you know, form follows function to the end ...
<P>
AL: Sort of a storyboard.
<P>
GL: You know, he does this board, and he lists every title. It's like on a
magnetic board where every title can be moved around, so you can play around
with the sequencing. On each of these little boards is a fantastic drawing
representing the essence of the song as Alex sees it, which is convincing us
more than ever that he's a sick human being. We played around with so many
different combinations and it was really tough, so this is the one order that
I think just seemed, when you're listening to an hour's worth of music, and
considering how much aggressive music was in there, we felt it was kind of a
nice way to ease you out of the record.
<P>
SW: "Cold Fire"'s one of my favorite tracks. Can you tell me a bit about
that?
<P>
GL: Um, "Cold Fire". That song went through many permutations.
<P>
AL: Yeah, that was actually one of the songs that we had a bit of a problem
getting into lyrically, working on it from a musical point of view.
<P>
GL: Yeah, it was hard to know the approach, and that was a song that we felt
a little ...
<P>
AL: That's right! Actually we had a few rewrites of this musically.
<P>
GL: We rewrote that song quite a bit. And thankfully, I think Peter Collins'
presence really pulled that song together. He came in and he pointed out
certain strengths in the previous versions of the songs that we had, and he
really helped us reorganize that song. It wasn't until he got there, I think,
that we finally locked in on a feel for those verses that enabled Alex to 
play those great kind of steel guitar lines -- steel guitar-like lines -- that
he's playing, and enabled me to open up harmonically. I was having trouble
with the verses, you know, it's a tough song, when you're dealing with this
issue of male/female relationships, which is such a foreign subject for us to
deal with, in a song. You want to make sure it doesn't sound trite or hackneyed
or you're not just doing yet another -- who needs another song about
relationships? It took us a while to get the right mood, and I was really
happy with the mood we ended up with in the verses, and I think, oddly enough,
as much as it was a nightmare, that song for me, when I hear the record now, I
think the verses are one of the strongest parts of the album, in that song.
<P>
AL: Yeah, I think there's a great balance between the romantic picture on the
one side, and how the music is sympathetic to those lyrics, and then the other
point of view, which is much colder ...
<P>
GL: Much tougher.
<P>
AL: ... more based in reality. And the contrast between the lyrics and the
music, and how they support each other, I think really worked out successfully
on that song, from what Ged said was a very difficult song for us to work on.
<P>
   [ "Cold Fire" is played ]
<P>
SW: This might sound crazy, but because of the subject matter of the song, and
also something about the feeling, and Geddy you mentioned Alex's guitar sort 
of a steel guitar sound, I thought with a slightly different treatment, this
could be a country song!
<P>
GL: It could be, actually we did a very slow country version of that song,
that we do have on tape somewheres ...
<P>
AL: On 8-track.
<P>
GL: ... and maybe when we're dead and our manager is exploiting our remains, he
will probably release that to some country-western fans.
<P>
AL: It's a cold fire.
<P>
GL: It's a cold fire, and it translates real well, so any country fans out
there ...
<P>
AL: We'd be beholden to you if you wrote it.
<P>
GL: ... if you wanna do that song and make it into a big country hit, we'd be
appreciative of the check.
<P>
TN: The Rush world premiere special of _Counterparts_ continues after this
time out.
<P>
   [commercial break]
<P>
SW: Back now with the conclusion of Rush _Counterparts_, the world album
premiere. To wrap things up, we'll have one final song from the album, a track
called "Cut To The Chase"; but before we get to that, a final thought or two
from Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson. During the last Rush tour, the band seemed to
have a definite air of rejuvenation about it; now, facing what will be a 20th
anniversary tour to kick off in January, I asked if that euphoria and that
sense of renewal were still with them.
<P>
GL: Oh, I think that happy phase wore off pretty quickly, and that's it.
<P>
AL: Yeah, we feel like that again, now, for at least this week anyways.
<P>
GL: That happy phase lasted about 10 days I think, and then we were renewed
and reborn and ... I think after so many interviewers asked us how we felt
about being reborn, we felt like we were not reborn anymore. 
<P>
AL: How come I don't wanna be reborn?
<P>
GL: All we wanted to do was fight. So this record we had some pretty darn good
fights, and I felt much better.
<P>
AL: Got a lot out of our systems.
<P>
GL: Yeah, got a lot out of our system. Mondays Alex and I would threaten to
murder each other.
<P>
SW: Is Rush kind of reinventing itself?
<P>
GL: Maybe, I don't know, that's a difficult word, "inventing". You know in 20
years ...
<P>
AL: Yeah, it's probably a vague question to ask, I mean I guess you could
interpret it any way you want, but ...
<P>
GL: I guess Rush is reasserting certain aspects of our band that have always
been there and maybe haven't shined the way they could have over the last
couple of years. And not trying to disregard the lessons that we've learned
over the years, we don't want to disregard the styles and some of the ways
that we have gone about working over the last few years. It's not a total
retromovement, you know, we don't want to throw away -- you don't cut off your
nose to spite your face kind of thing. If a song ...
<P>
AL: You don't??
<P>
GL: ... well, maybe you do. But, you know what I mean, if a song deserves a
certain treatment, you give it. If a song is not working that way, you try
something else, and if you're sitting there trying to write a song in essence
is raw and supposed to crank it up a bit, let's do it and let's not pussyfoot,
and I think that's what this record is doing well.
<P>

SW: One last thing; we almost forgot the last word on this program -- Geddy
Lee's fall baseball prognostications. We told you about it at the beginning of
the program, and now here it is. Geddy, if you would gaze into your crystal
baseball, and tell us what's going to happen in this year's World Series.
<P>
GL: Well, who's ever pitching stinks the least will win.
