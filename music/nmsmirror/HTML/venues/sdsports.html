Places To Stay
</font>
<ul>
The easiest way to find a hotel is take 8 east (from 5) until you get to Hotel 
Circle, then get off and find a place! They have every hotel from Motel 6 to 
the Hilton. There are also hotels scattered along 5 if you head north towards
Los Angeles.

Places To Eat<p>
</font>
<em>Special note: all restaraunts in San Diego are non-smoking. The only
exception is if the restaraunt has a bar, smoking is allowed at the 
bar.</em><p>

<ul>
<strong>Anthony's Fish Grotto</strong> 1360 N. Harbor Dr (619) 232-5103<br>
If you like fish, you HAVE to try this place! It's located on the harbor, on a 
platform over the water, right next to the Star of India maritime museum (the 
Star is the oldest ironsided ship still capable of sailing). The best time to 
go is late afternoon before dinner; once dinner hits, expect an hour or more
wait. Have lots of fresh fish, and an excellent lobster louie. Dinners are
$8 - $14. From the Sports Arena, take 5 South to Kettner Blvd. At Laurel St 
turn right (towards the airport). At the end, turn left on Harbor Dr (turning 
right takes you to the airport). The restaraunt will be on the right side, look
for the Star of India. NOTE!! Parking is metered, you MUST pay to park every
day including Sunday, until 6pm.<p>

<strong>Fins</strong><p>

<strong>Roberto's</strong> (lots of locations)<br>
Mexican fast food at its best! Some are open 24 hours and perfect for that 
after-concert craving. For something different, try asking for a carne asada
quesadilla (not on the menu).<p>
</ul>

Other Things To Do<p>
</font>
<ul>
<strong>Balboa Park</strong><br>
Home to museums, the Laserium, and the San Diego Zoo. All museums cost to get
in (from $3-6 each), although once a month each museum is free (dates vary
for each museum). The Laserium has both laser shows and an IMAX theater, but
laser shows are infrequent. The zoo is at the north end of the park, and is
around $20 per person. Take 163 South to Park Blvd, exit and go north. 
Signs will lead you to your final destination. Parking is free.<p>

<strong>Belmont Park</strong><br>
Right along the beach, has many shops, eating and the only wooden rollercoaster
designated as a national historic landmark (The Giant Dipper). Take I-5 to
Sea World Drive, exit and go west. Take Ingraham St north, then West Mission
Bay Drive (two complex interchanges). Turn left at Mission Blvd, you'll
see the rollercoaster on the corner. Parking is limited, so try to go earlier 
in the day. Parking is free, the rides each cost around $2.<p>

<strong>Mt. Soledad</strong><br>
The highest point in San Diego proper, it towers just over 1,000 feet above
sea level. Has a great view of La Jolla and Miramar, and awesome at night!
There is limited parking around the cross at the top, and a lot a little 
further down the road. Take 52 West to the end, it turns into Ardath Road.
Take Ardath to Hidden Valley Road and turn left (there is a Denny's to the 
right). Turn right at the first stop sign, and follow the yellow dividing line
up the hill. At the top you CANNOT turn left into the park; instead take
the first right and do a U-turn back out.<p>

<strong>Sea World</strong><br>
How could you come to San Diego and not see Sea World? Home to Shamu and
many other marine mammals, it's a great place to spend the day. Parking is $4, 
admission is $20. Take I-5 to Sea World Drive, exit and head west. It'll
be on the right side a few miles down, just follow the signs.<p>

<strong>Stephen Birch Aquarium (formerly Scripps Aquarium)</strong><br>
The old Scripps Aquarium has relocated up the hill, directly across from the 
UCSD campus. Lots of beautiful fish, including a huge kelp forest display
and a touch tide pool in the back. Parking is $4, admission is $6. Take I-5 to 
La Jolla Village Drive, exit and go west. Continue straight up the hill 
through several lights, and follow the signs. It'll be on the left-hand 
side.
