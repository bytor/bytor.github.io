<p>
As a computer science student at Warwick University, England, I have
access to <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.tnms.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.tnms.com/'" tppabs="http://www.tnms.com/">"The National 
Midnight Star</a>" -- a computer-based Rush mailing list.
Naturally the existence of this list is not well-known beyond Rush fans
involved in computing, but with well over 500 subscribers in North and South
America, Europe and Asia, it proves to be a valuable forum for exchange of
Rush-related information and discussion.
<p>
First, some background to the National Midnight Star (NMS), in terms
everyone can understand (I hope!). The NMS, along with other "newsgroups"
covering a wide range of subjects, is posted over the USENET -- a world-wide
self-governing electronic bulletin board. Computer systems based within
companies, universities, research centres and other sites are linked into the
USENET and computer users on these systems can communicate using electronic
mail.
<p>
Each day a copy of the NMS arrives in my computer "mailbox" at Warwick
University -- the list originates from the University Of Maryland in the USA,
and finds its way to Warwick via a trans-Atlantic computer link to the
University of London. Of course, all this detail is invisible to users of the
system, just as the internal workings of postal mail systems are invisible to
people posting letters. As a subscriber to the NMS I can post an article to
the mailing list as easily as I can post letters to the Spirit Of Rush, though
in general it's much faster; electronic mail posted by me to addresses in
America can be received and the reply back in my mail box within an hour on a
good day!
<p>
The NMS recently celebrated its first anniversary; it may be only 15
months old but in that time it has grown considerably. The NMS was the
brainchild of Jimmy Lang -- an upper-classman at the University Of San Diego
in California. Jimmy started the Rush mailing list when he noticed the volume
of Rush-related discussion on newsgroups concerned with music in general. He
thought that a forum dedicated to Rush would allow fans to exchange views free
from the "flames" of the inevitable Rush bashers on other music newsgroups.
After a few false starts the list was born and gradually grew in size to the
point where it was becoming difficult to handle, given the facilities
available to Jimmy.
<p>
At this point David Arnold came to the rescue -- David is a staff
computer consultant at the University Of Maryland, and a friend of Jimmy
Lang's. in the past they had exchanged tapes ( "of the collectable nature", to
use Jimmy's own words) by post for some months, and eventually met when David
made a trip to the California area. David's job allowed him access to
facilities unavailable to Jimmy, namely a "site" suitable for basing a
full-blown mailing list on. The site was established and is appropriately
known as "syrinx" at the University Of Maryland.
<p>
David Arnold is now the manager of the NMS; this job entails moderating
articles that are posted to syrinx for inclusion in the mailing list. One
reason for the list's continued popularity is the fact that subject matter is
mainly restricted to Rush and potentially offensive "flame" postings are
moderated by David.
<p>
Well, that's enough background I think. What kind of articles appear on
the NMS? In a lot of ways the list is very similar to the Spirit Of Rush --
Rush trivia abounds, interviews, concert reviews and readers' opinions on
Rush's work appear regularly. However, the NMS has one major advantage over
the Spirit Of Rush in that an issue appears almost every day. This allows such
things as discussions to take place more easily, even though in some cases it
might be fairer to call them arguments! The name of the list ( The National
Midnight Star ) was decided by a poll of all the subscribers; we simply mailed
our preferences to syrinx and a few days later the list received its name; I'm
sure I needn't point out that this is a quote from "Red Lenses"!
<p>
I've been following Rush for over 12 years now -- since I was seven years
old, and thought I knew a reasonable amount about the group in general; since
subscribing to the NMS I've realized that I was wrong. Each day I tend to find
out yet another thing I didn't previously know about Rush and their work. Most
of the contributions to the list come from North America and several
subscribers have reasonably close links with the group -- one subscriber's
friend even received a postcard from Neil informing him of when the band would
be back in the studio to record the next album following Presto!
<p>
As a sample of the articles which appear on the NMS here are some
summaries of general trivia/facts I've read over the past few months (I
apologize if any of these are common knowledge by the time this gets printed):
<p>
One subscriber pointed out a possible source of the "words of the profits"
lyrics at the end of "The Spirit Of Radio"; they bear a remarkable similarity
to lyrics from "The Sound Of Silence" by Simon & Garfunkel. It could be that
Neil intended a play on these lyrics when he wrote "The Spirit Of Radio."
<p>
Bill "B-Man" Banasiewicz is allegedly working on another book on the
band; this book is scheduled to appear during the first half of 1991. (This
particular posting came from a friend of Ray Wawryzniak, who is assisting with
the book.)
<p>
The song "Anagram" contains only 4 true anagrams, those in which all the
letters of one word are used to form another word. Shane Faulkner, a regular
subscriber to NMS, points out that Neil also uses anagrams of sorts in "Tom
Sawyer"; "Catch the witness -- Catch the wit, Catch the spirit -- Catch the
spit."
<p>
"Let us not go gently into that endless winter night" is a line from a
Dylan Thomas poem -- Neil has often talked of how his ideas are sometimes
drawn from the books he reads, including those by Ayn Rand and John Dos Passos
(who wrote books entitled "The Camera Eye" and "The Big Money").
<p>
During the Presto tour last year Rush played Shoreline Amphitheater,
Mountain View, on June 27th. When Rush struck up "In The Mood" Mr. Big (the
support band) joined them on stage, and Alex played the solo using a Makita
drill! This mimicked the on-stage tricks employed by Mr. Big's guitarist Paul
Gilbert, although it is said Alex received the biggest cheer.
<p>
On 20th November 1990 Rush received the accolade of "Canadian group of
the decade" -- Bryan Adams received "artist of the decade." Alex was
interviewed by Toronto radio station Q107; he stated that the band's first
reaction on hearing of the award was "Which decade?"
<p>
The Family Channel (a TV channel available to American cable TV viewers)
is regarded by many as a haven for Christian fundamentalists -- the Pat
Robertsons and Jimmy Swaggerts of this world. They recently ran a special on
'back-masking'; concealment of messages in songs by recording them backwards.
Rush were accused of concealing satanic messages in "Beneath, Between And
Behind." Naturally this resulted in many articles on the NMS, and no doubt
prompted a lot of people to play their tapes backwards. Somehow, I doubt they
found anything.
<p>
Alex Lifeson's son Justin was interviewed on Toronto radio Q107 recently.
He recalled the recording of Signals as Le Studio; pictures exist of Neil with
his Tama kit out on a lake. Seemingly they miked up the drum kit on the float
and Neil played most of the tracks for "Analog Kid" out on the lake.
(Personally I remain skeptical about this -- is it mentioned in Visions?)
<p>
That's a very small sample of the sort of articles appearing on NMS
daily. As a British reader I find it informative yet frustrating to read
American subscriber's reviews and opinions of the recent Presto tour. Most
people seemed to enjoy the shows immensely, with ongoing discussions about the
stage effects, sound quality, bunny girls and Alex's guitar strings breaking.
One article even speculated that Alex does this on purpose in order to set the
stage for a flashy guitar switch!
<p>
American fans have had access to the Rush "Chronicles" video for some
months now and regularly air their views on it. The video seems to have had a
mixed reception, with complaints about video quality and content. Obviously,
much of the older material will have been transferred onto video format from
dated media, making the quality incomparable with that of "A Show Of Hands."
Yet another appearance of Tom Sawyer from the Exit... Stage Left video doesn't
seem like a particularly astute move to me, but I guess it allows the video to
stand up as a Chronicle of Rush's work in a fuller sense. Blasts from the
past in the form of "The Trees" and "Closer To The Heart" and the studio
version of "Limelight" (show at Le Studio as was "Vital Signs" from "The
Camera Eye" video) make this a must-have for me. At the time of writing I had
not seen Chronicles in my area, though I'm sure it must be around in the UK by
now.
<p>
The National Midnight Star continues to grow and provides a valuable
source of information for computer users who just happen to be Rush fans --
along with the Spirit Of Rush it's certainly essential reading for me.
<p>
Big thanks go out to David Arnold and Jimmy Lang who were more than
enthusiastic in providing me with raw material for this article -- cheers
guys!! Thanks also to NMS subscribers for the steady flow of material which
helps make up the NMS each day.
