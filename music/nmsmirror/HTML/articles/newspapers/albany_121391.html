<font size=+1>Rush a streamlined powerhouse</font><br>

Albany -- "Why are we here? Because we're here," proclaimed Geddy Lee.<p>

No, he wasn't a philosophy professor delivering an introductory lecture in
Existentialism 101 at Albany State.<p>

Rather, Lee was the bassist-vocalist of the Canadian power-rock trio Rush, and
that basic, little Q-and-A exchange during the song "Roll the Bones," was at
the core of their arena-rock extravaganza at the Knickerbocker Arena Thursday
night.<p>

The near-capacity crowd of enthusiastic fans knew exactly why they were there,
however, and it wasn't for the philosophy of it all, by any means.<p>

"Rush rocks," the fans proclaimed over and over again, nearly as loudly as the
band's own high-decibel rampage.<p>

Rush has never been afraid of tackling big issues with their lyrics (for
example, the illusion-vs.-reality debate of "Presto" album or the struggle
between fate and chance that dominates their current "Roll the Bones" LP), but
there's always been a big, bruising backbeat behind the words.<p>

In the late '70s, the band -- which also features guitarist Alex Lifeson and
drummer Neil Peart -- was a perfect example of the kind of wretched musical
excess that that decade spawned.<p>

But, in recent years, Rush has developed into a streamlined rock-and-roll
powerhouse, discarding the excess baggage in favor of more accessible pop
melodies and straight-ahead arrangements. Nobody's about to mistake these guys
for the Ramones, mind you, but less is definitely more in the current Rush
music mode.<p>

What's most surprising is that they've somehow managed to maintain the muscle
and sharped the crisp cutting edge of their musicianship along the way.<p>

Lee reined in his shrieking helium-voiced howl, and during songs like "Show
Don't Tell" and "Dreamline," he instilled his vocals with dynamic
discipline.<p>

Lifeson and Peart both played with considerably more economy than they've
displayed in the past, even during their requisite solos.<p>

Although they've pared back the complexity of their music, Rush still hasn't
trimmed any of the special effects from their multi-media stage spectacle. In
a non-stop parade of typical arena-rock showmanship, Rush assaulted fans with
mega-watt lighting, billowing fog, razor-sharp lasers and a surround-sound,
quadrophonic speaker system, as well as a barrage of rear-projection films and
videos.<p>

While their musicianship was quite commanding on songs like "Bravado" and "The
Pass," the trio's stage presence was not. All too often the three musicians
onstage were completely buried under an avalanche of special-effects gimmickry
that made them seem lifeless and mechanical. With all the theatrical,
high-tech hoakum that bombarded the crowd, the music itself seemed almost
incidental.<p>

And let's not forget that pair of giant white rabbits that popped out of top
hats during the climactic cruise through "Superconductor," either. Why were
they there? Well, because they were there, I guess.<p>
