  <font size=+2>B</font>ack to 1975, however. 'Fly By Night' was released in North America
in February 1975 at the same time as Rush received their first major
award.<p>
                                                
  That was the Juno Award - Canada's equivalent to the American
Grammy - as the nation's most promising new group. Says Geddy Lee:
"That was a great help to us in Canada. It brought us a lot of
attention from a lot of people who hadn't heard of us or people who
didn't really take us seriously. But it didn't really help us much
anywhere else."<p>
                                               
  Quite so. Despite the enormous amount of talent that has emerged
from Canada, the United States, its southern neighbour, has remained
steadfastly unimpressed by the nation's musical credibility. Being big
in Canada, as far as the States is concerned, means about as much as
being big in Belgium does in Britain.<p>
                                               
  However, Rush have never been a band to be daunted just by being
ignored.<p>
                                               
  Managers Danniels and Wilson and the band have always been
subscribers to the theory that to gain a following among fans you have
to get out on the road. That's what Rush have done for most of their
career.<p>

  "We used to do about 200 concerts a year", says Lifeson talking about
nine months followed by maybe a couple of months in the recording
studio."<p>

  So, with their Juno Award safely in the bag and 'Fly By Night' out
on the streets Rush set off on their second tour of the States, a four
month long stint supporting Aerosmith and Kiss.<p>

  Needless to say Rush still weren't exactly loaded financially and
for transport on much of the tour they had to hire a car. Alex Lifeson
later told Rolling Stone magazine that they told the car hire firm in
Toronto they were just going to use the vehicle for a few dates. They
brought it back with 11,OOO miles on the clock, no hubcaps, a broken
radio and no mirror. "It was ruined", he said mildly. "They were quite
surprised."<p>

  This was a better tour than the previous one for Rush. First they
were linked with bands who would bring in far larger numbers of people
than on their previous, ground-breaking jaunt round the States. And
secondly they had material to play which was much more suited to the
three piece line-up of Lifeson, Peart and Lee.<p>

  They returned to Toronto in July to begin work on their third album,
'Caress Of Steel' which picked up where 'Fly By Night' had left off.<p>

  Previously, by the way, the band had fulfilled an ambition by doing
their own headlining tour of Canada which included a sell-out
performance at Toronto's 4,000 seater Massey Hall which for all of
them was the realisation of an ambition.
"We'd never been able to do a tour of Canada or even the midwest of the
country before," said Lifeson. "Everyone said heavy metal was dead and
gone and we were out of fashion." Peart added that to play Massey Hall
was one of his first great ambitions and he used to dream of being on
the stage there.<p>

  'Caress' was released in North America in September 1975 and it
proved a further step up in the band's career - both commercially and
musically. The album featured the exquisitely melodic 'Lakeside Park',
the amusing 'I Think I'm Going Bald' and a welcome return of By-Tor
who meets up with the 'Necromancer'. Best of all, though, one whole
side of the record was devoted to 'Fountain Of Lamneth' a typically
allegorical, mythological, Iyrical and almost hermetic piece of
writing by Peart.<p>

  In all it was an epic effort and the final stamp of authenticity on
Rush's claim to be more than just a head bashing band in the tradition
of Grand Funk and Blue Cheer.<p>

  With that ambition realised, they were off on tour round the
continent of North America again. This was another near four month
long trek which saw Rush achieving the status of special guests in
some areas and as headliners - for the first time in the States - in
others. At the same time the band began to notice that their music was
being heard internationally.<p>
                                
  Import sales of their first three albums began to show significant
increases in countries such as Germany Sweden and Holland, while Japan
reported the presence of a Rush fan club. By March of 1976 'Fly By
Night' had been certified a gold album in Canada, while 'Caress Of
Steel' had racked up around 40,000 sales in Canada alone.<p>
                                
  However, as pleasant as that might have been, Rush's minds were
elsewhere. They were concentrating on completing their fourth album
  '2112'.<p>

  Soon after the release of '2112' Geddy Lee explained in interview
after interview that the band had wanted to achieve something
musically like Ayn Rand had in her novel "Anthem".<p>

  <font size=+2>T</font>he original idea for attempting something as wide-reaching came
from Neil Peart. He began working on Iyrics and gradually his
enthusiasm infected the other two members of the band. All told it
took about six months for them to finish writing the material. Peart
naturally concentrated on the Iyrics and "musical suggestions" while
Lee and Lifeson provided the music.<p>
                     
  At the end of those six months Rush went into the Toronto Sound
studios with producer/engineer Terry Brown and spent a month getting
the completed work down on vinyl. It's worth noting by the way, that
'2112' like all their previous albums, was written by Rush while they
were on the road. The recording contract they'd signed and the
gruelling live touring schedule they'd set themselves allowed for very
little time off.<p>
                                                
  Equally interesting, particularly when one hears the finished
product, is that Rush used less overdubbing on '2112' than on any of
their previous albums. They had learnt that it was important, if not
essential, to be able to reproduce the studio sound of an album on
stage - if they weren't going to run the risk of disappointing devoted
fans.<p>

  As the title indicates the album is set in the future, in the year
2112, when the world is under the domination of a pseudo-religious
dictatorship - the Priests of the Temple of Syrinx.<p>

  The Priests run society along the lines of benevolent and logical
despotism. Anything which isn't logical has no place in society and
must be destroyed.<p>

  It is, of course, portrayed as a soulless and joyless society devoid
of any of the arts. The hero discovers an ancient artefact - a guitar -
which, to his amazement produces a curious hitherto unheard-of sound
called music.<p>

  He takes his discovery to the Priests, convinced that they will be
as thrilled as he is. But they conclude that music is illogical and
can be of no earthly use and they destroy his guitar.<p>
  
  Miserably, the hero crawls away and has a dream about a world which
is different from the one run by the Priests. This merely saddens him
until he discovers that the planet of his dream is real and that
things can change.<p>
  
  The close of the album with a godlike voice booming out "Attention
all planets of the Solar Federation - we have assumed control . . . we
have assumed control . . . we have assumed control" is one of the most
chilling and powerful finales ever captured on vinyl. And on stage
it's even better.<p>

  Needless to say, an album as controversial and as different as this
has over the years caused a lot of polarised opinions.<p>
                             
  Some critics have seen it as the ultimate example of Rush the raging
right-wing capitalists. And matters weren't helped when Peart
announced to one interviewer soon after the release of '2112' that he
felt "humanitarians are just the same as dictators."<p>

  However, when the album was released, it proved to be very much
Rush's breakthrough vinyl outing in the States. Billboard magazine
described the album - rather curiously - as "Hard, crashing heavy
metal rock from a trio that sounds like a lot of other groups but
still stands out because of lead singer Geddy Lee's uncanny vocal
resemblance to Robert Plant, and the better than average musicianship.<p>

  "Lots of fun - but the group, which has a large group of fans now,
 will need a bit more distinctive sound if they are to progress much
 more."<p>
                   
 Cashbox reckoned that the album was a "valid and melodic tale of
possible things to come" while Record World pronounced that '2112' was
"an album sure to pass the Memorex test in 2112 or today."<p>
                   
  As far as the band themselves were concerned '2112' was one hell of
an achievement. Neil rated it as a first plateau, a realization of the
aims the band had set themselves when they first got together. He also
added a little later that the album had really drained Rush and had
exhausted, temporarily, the band's supply of fresh ideas. That could
have been the main reason why the next album from Rush was the
tremendously exciting double live set 'All The World's A Stage' which
came out in the autumn of 1976.<p>

 <font size=+2>I</font>n june of that year Rush played three nights at Toronto's Massey
Hall. Initially set to do just the 11th and 12th, the promoter, Martin
Onret, had been forced to add a third night on the 13th to satisfy the
colossal demand.<p>

  That should have been no surprise however. By the time June of that
year had come round '2112' had sold 160,000 copies in North America.
'Rush' and 'Caress Of Steel' had received gold albums for sales in
Canada and the band had completed a two month tour of the States
playing well over 50 cities and headlining in most of them.<p>

  Apparently there was a colossal thunderstorm during the Rush stint
at the Massey Hall with hailstones thundering out of the skies on to
Toronto. But, judging by the sound that was recorded at those shows,
Rush outdid the forces of nature. Peart just about demolisiled a drum
kit in his frenetic efforts to get down a good sound.<p>

  The result of those three shows was the live album 'All The World's
A Stage'. The band took the tapes of those concerts to their old
familiar Toronto Sound studio and spent more than a month, working
three or four days a week, remixing and dubbing.<p>

  Fortunately, for those who believe that live albums really should be
live and not some bastard offspring of the studio and the stage, Rush
used very few overdubs on 'Stage'. Geddy Lee promised that there were
just a couple of vocals dubs and a little judicious grafting of a drum
solo from one night into the body of the performance from another. And
there were technical details that had to be ironed out too, such as
the fact that Alex Lifeson had broken a guitar string during 'Working
Man' on one night which was corrected in the studio.<p>

  What 'Stage' represented, when it was released in September of 1976
was a kind of anthology of the band's best work from their first four
albums.<p>

  In the States 'Stage' was the perfect follow-up to '2112' and
garnered consistently good reviews. Just as an example, listen to
Record World who said: "Building its American reputation slowly but
steadily Rush stands poised for breaking through all the way via this
two record live set reflecting the group's first four LPs and its
North American tours of earlier this year. All the highly charged
electricity is here in an explosive setting."<p>
                             
  Surprisingly, though, like the previous four albums 'Stage' had
still not been released in Britain. It was being imported in limited
quantities by Phonogram Records who were still unsure of just how
valid and worthwhile - commercially speaking - Rush were for the
British market.<p>
                             
  And, looking at it historically, you can see the record company's
point. So-called "heavy metal" was just about the deadest dodo
around, certainly as far as the majority of the media was concerned.
New Wave was the thing and it would probably have seemed like the
strangest thing in the world to actually start raving about a three
piece "progressive" band from Canada - of all places. So Phonogram
decided to follow a medium course and import Rush albums rather than
release them in their own right.<p>

  However, it's a fact that they were watching out for signs that Rush
could take off. Certainly sales of the import albums were doing
exceptionally well. But there was also a certain gentleman by the name
of Geoff Barton writing then - and now - for Sounds who was carrying
on what was practically a one man crusade on behalf of Rush.<p>

  He got hold of a copy of 'All The World's A Stage' in November 1976
and gave it a rave review, rating it a five star album. He concluded a
list of superlatives with the following advice: "Rush are probably the
best undiscovered band in Britain at the moment. I strongly recommend
you to check them out. Now."<p>

  In Canada punters were needing no such advice. By the end of the
year 'Stage' had gone gold - the first home produced live album to go
gold and the first double album to achieve that same feat.<p>

  During the autumn of 1976 Rush embarked on a coast to coast tour of
their native Canada and then they followed this up with dates in the
northwest of the United States and five dates in California.<p>

  Those latter dates give some indication of how Rush had grown in
stature with the band pulling in a total of 45,000 people. Previously
they had played just small club dates in the States.<p>

  At this stage Rush were in a rather curious position as far as
concert attendances were concerned in the United States. They were
doing well in the West and the Midwest, able to play headline date
after headline date at substantial concert halls. But in the east -
areas like New York and Massachusetts - they had little pulling power
at all. Given their intention to conquer the whole of the States, one
way or another, Rush decided to chance their arms in the east during
December 1976. They special guested with Foghat in New York and
Massachusetts and in Montreal guested with Aerosmith.<p>

  In the stern city of Chicago way up in Illinois Rush had previously
managed to bring in just 1,400 people. In December of 1976 they
headlined in a 4,000 seaterhall - a date which had sold out two weeks
in advance.<p>

  In Indianapolis, one of Rush's strong territories, the band
headlined a three act show - Bob Seger and The Atlanta Rhythm Section
opened - and they drew in a spectacular 18,000 people.<p>
                   
  On December 30 in Hamilton, Ontario, Rush played before 3,300 - a
capacity crowd - with 2,000 more people being turned away in sub-zero
temperatures. The band sold out their New Year's Eve show at the
Toronto Concert Bowl within a few days and they had to add a second
date at the same venue - also sold out - on January 3,1977. More than
14,000 people paid to get into these shows which confirmed Rush as the
top- drawing live rock band in Canada.<p>

  The year of 1977 opened up in much the same way as 1976 closed with
Rush out on the road gigging everywhere between Houston, Texas and
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, there was a new feeling of
confidence within the band. They'd been picking up gold albums all
over the place and had expanded their sphere of live operations to
cover the whole of the North American continent. Said Alex Lifeson at
the end of 1976: "We seem to have been on the road for four years and
occasionally get the odd day off." He admitted that it was just about
impossible to break down their schedule into separate tours. All of
the dates seemed to run into each other.<p>

  But in 1977 they were planning well ahead and giving themselves more
time to work on their albums - instead of having to write them in the
spare time that they had on the road.<p>

  <font size=+2>O</font>ne of their plans for the future which they announced at the end of
1976 was that they would be coming to Britain in the middle of 1977 to
record their next album.
  Fans in Britain reasoned that if that were so the odds were that
Rush would also be playing some live dates - their first outside of
North America.<p>

  The decision to try recording in England was an interesting one. The
band had never recorded outside of Toronto, at least not successfully.<p>

  At the end of 1976 they'd tried working in New York's Electric Lady
Studios - the operation set up by the late Jimi Hendrix and
immortalised on his 'Electric Ladyland' album with its notorious
British cover. However they'd been forced to scrap what they'd done
simply because they were dissatisfied with the results. One of the
reasons was apparently that they didn't feel at home in an American
studio - curious, since they were spending most of their time in the
States at this stage.<p>
    
  Favourite studio for the new album, at the time, appeared to be
George Martin's AIR Studios in London's Oxford Street. Easily one of
the best appointed in the country it would have been a natural choice.
Also it would have been something of a spiritual home-coming for Neil
Peart since the last time he'd been in London he'd been working a
stone's throw away in Carnaby Street selling trinkets to the tourists.<p>

  As it turned out, however, Rockfield Studios in South Wales were to
get Rush's custom and the album they recorded there was the excellent
'A Farewell To Kings.' But that's getting ahead of ourselves. Before
Rockfield beckoned Rush had a lot more dates to get through.<p>

  In January of 1977 they were being raved over in Houston, Texas by
the local rock critic who drooled over the band's music and reckoned
that Rush were "in rare and esteemed company."<p>

  In Columbus, Ohio, the band had originally scheduled one concert but
that sold Out within a week and a second one was added. The local
writer there on the Columbus Dispatch seemed astounded that "heavy
metal rock" was still popular. "Wrapping up", she wrote, "anyone who
braved snow and winds to experience the show were far more than warmed
up. They were fried to a frizzle by Rush."<p>
                              
  At the same time, though, most critics were talking about how Rush
had gotten where they were without much, if any, radio airplay which
previously had been reckoned as being essential to any sort of success
for a rock band in the States.<p>

  And this was a factor that was worrying the band's American record
company too. It was, they figured, all very well for Rush to be
slogging their guts out in every gig that God sent but radio airplay
would be very much the icing on the cake, a way of reaching far more
rock fans than if Rush stayed on the road until hell froze over.<p>

  So they came up with a plan. Phonogram/Mercury decided to put
together a special sampler album for rock radio stations featuring
tracks from the last three Rush studio albums. In addition they set up
an extensive advertising campaign for all five of the band's albums.<p>

  Said one Jules Abramson, senior vice president of marketing: We are
zeroing in on the entire Rush catalogue of albums because we feel once
a person sees the group in concert or hears a recent LP they will want
other albums by the group.<p>

  The sampler album was cunningly entitled 'Everything Your Listeners
Ever Wanted To Hear by Rush . . . But You Were Afraid To Play.' It
featured five tracks from 'Fly By Night,' three from 'Caress Of Steel'
and four from '2112.'<p>

  A promotion man for the company added that "Sometimes radio
programmers' tastes do not coincide with their listeners'. For
example, both Aerosmith and Kiss were forced on the air by listeners.
And now it's Rush. "A group of this nature can easily go from gold to
platinum status with airplay."<p>

  Whether the record company's scheme had any real effect it's
difficult to say even now. The first time I spoke with Rush, Geddy and
Neil were both resigned to the seeming fact that they would never get
any radio airplay.<p>

  Geddy told me: "As far as we're concerned it seems that radio
programmers don't believe we exist. No matter how many sell-out shows
we do, no matter how many albums we sell they still don't seem to be
interested.
  "I don't think there's any point in being bitter about it, though.
It seems to be just a fact of life. As long as we keep pulling in
audiences and selling records we believe that we're doing the right
thing. Anyway, we've been on the road for so long now I don't think we
could imagine any other kind of lifestyle."<p>

  <font size=+2>E</font>ven as late as May 1981, Rolling Stone magazine was still
commenting on "radio station programme directors who deem the group's
brand of progressive aggro-rock as unfit for airplay."
 
  Between April 8 and May 21 Rush played a series of American dates
concentrating mainly on the north east - their weakest area - plus a
few midwest dates. They opened in Toledo, Ohio, and closed in Chicago
with two nights at the Aragaon Ballroom.<p>

  After a short break the band geared themselves up for their first
European tour. The first three dates were scheduled for Britain -
Manchester Free Trade Hall on June 2, Birmingham Odeon on June 3 and
London Hammersmith Odeon on June 4.<p>

  They were then set to play dates in Sweden, Germany and Holland, all
of which countries boasted a small but vociferous cult following for
Rush - usually propagated by word of mouth.<p>

  There was quiet confidence in the Rush camp about the upcoming dates
  but significantly in Britain tickets for the three shows were put on
sale well up front (about seven weeks ahead as a matter of fact).<p>

  Of course, they sold out within days. To appreciate the significance
of that achievement you have to remember that this was the summer of
'77. The Clash were singing 'London's Burning' and The Sex Pistols
were finding it hard to get anywhere to play at all - and getting
maximum publicity out of their predicament.<p>
                              
  Rush seemed about as at home in this musical maelstrom as the Duke
of Edinburgh would be at the Marquee. And yet they thrived.<p>

  The biggest surprise among the British rock critics appeared to be
that a band like Rush came from Canada. Writer Dave Redshaw who
reviewed Rush's Manchester date recalls his astonishment that Canada -
land of Joni Mitchell and The Band - could cough up anything like
Rush.<p>

  Redshaw zeroed in on the band's affection for Ayn Rand - a decidedly
unfashionable stance in the punk days - and also likened Geddy's
singing voice to that of David Surkamp of the relatively obscure
Pavlov's Dog, a comparison that was to be repeated many times in the
British rock press over the next few years.<p>

  What was highly important about those first dates in Britain was
that it was obvious that Rush, despite little if any promotion, had
sufficient fans for them to sell out major venues up and down the
country.<p>

  In addition, those fans were sufficiently loyal to have searched out
the Rush albums that were available in this country on import. As
Redshaw recalls "They seemed to know every single riff that Rush
played."<p>

  <font size=+2>W</font>ith those dates to their credit, plus the European ones which went
equally well, Rush hightailed it to the wilds of South Wales and
Rockfield Studios. They were to begin work on an album which had the
working title of 'Closer To The Heart.' When it was finally released
in September of 1977 it had been renamed 'A Farewell To Kings.'<p>

  True to their word Rush, having described 'All The World's A Stage'
as the end of the beginning, the closer to Phase One, brought out an
experimental and refreshing album in the shape of 'A Farewell To
Kings.'<p>

  There was certainly a pastoral feeling to some of the tracks -
perhaps due to the bucolic surroundings of Rockfield - but the band
also seemed more relaxed and more sure of their capabilities.<p>

  They also included a blockbuster of a track in the shape of 'Cygnus
X-1' which culminates in the spacecraft pilot hero plunging into a
Black Hole - a neat science fiction version of the cliffhanger endings
of the old Saturday matinee movies. Would he return? And how? And How!<p>

  Rush did some extra work on the 'Farewell' album at Advision Studios
in the heart of London's West End - a setting which couldn't have been
further from Rockfield.<p>

  And at the time I had just become press officer for the band at
Phonogram in London. We were all aware at the record company that we
had a potentially hot property on our hands in the form of Rush and it
was up to me to pull in some press coverage on them.<p>

  On July 13 I found myself in the company of Melody Maker's Chris
Welch heading for Advision in a limo. We were ushered into the 
presence and I said a few small words of introduction before making
myself scarce. There's a of code conduct in interviews which means
that you should never really sit in on a discussion between a
journalist and an artist. You might cramp both their styles and end up
with a very stilted interview.<p>
                                                         
  I went to see Rush again - if only make myself vaguely known to them
couple of days later. I decided I should take a few beers with me to
make myself more welcome.<p>

  I was greeted politely and we talk of this and that, but inevitably
it was small talk and somehow I found myself getting more and more
embarrassed. It was obvious that they wanted to get on with what they
were doing - pressure of time and all that - so I left Rush and Terry
Brown to their own devices and scurried off.<p>
                                                         
  I remember thinking that they were kind of stand-offish people and
wondering what it was that had made things so unnatural and
uncomfortable.<p>

  I realized later - much later - that Rush collectively have the most
immense power of concentration. They apply themselves to one task at a
time devoting all their time and energy to it until it is complete. I
said at the beginning of this book that the opening of their British
tour in February 1978, was when I first met them. So even though I had
encountered them at Advision more than six months earlier I still feel
that that tour was the first time I met them.<p>

  At the beginning of August a tape arrived at Phonogram's London
offices - a tape of the new album, 'A Farewell To Kings.' A playback
of the album was arranged, a record company tradition which allows the
people who'll be working on the album to get used to it before it's
released and to work out just how to present the album when they're
approaching record company executives or music paper journalists.<p>

  We decided that this was the ideal opportunity to give Geoff Barton
of Sounds an exclusive upfront preview of the album. He had been
easily the staunchest supporter of Rush in Britain since their albums
had started trickling over and besides that we figured that if we gave
him an exclusive we'd get better and bigger coverage of the album.
It's a standard record company ploy.<p>

  But Barton wasn't to be found. He was on holiday or on the road with
someone - or something like that. So we opted for Sounds' Pete
Makowski, second only to Barton in enthusiasm for Rush.<p>
