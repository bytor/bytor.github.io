Transcription by Dan Newcombe (STDN@vm.marist.edu)

(I know that this is not 100% accurate, but it is closer
 than nothing.  If you have corrections, please post them
 in a nice civilized manner.  No flames, they're a waste.)

pass the moment with a drink and a friend.  I let my skin get

too thin, I'd like to pause, no matter what I

pretend             like some pilgram who learns to transcend.

as if each step were the end.

(Guitar Tacet)

 Experience slips away   Experience slips away      Time Stand still

A A

(2nd verse same as the first as far as music goes.)
I turn my face to the sun, close my eyes, let my defences down,
all those wounds that I can't get unwound.  I let my past get
too fast, no time to pause, if I could slow it all down, like
some captain whose ship runs aground, I can wait till the tide
comes around.

Chorus:
 "Time stand still.  I'm not looking back, but I wanna look around
me now. Time stand still, see more of the people and the places
that surround me

(Play riff one)

A B ???

(Play riff 5 4 times)

(The rest of the song is taken from the parts that come
 after the slow part of the chorus.  They are easy to figure
 out, mostly E A and B chords, and I am too tired to
 type them in)
