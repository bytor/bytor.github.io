<font size=+1>RUSH SHOWS IT STILL CAN ROCK AFTER 22 YEARS</font><br>
<b>by Bob Kurson</b><p>

If you were a square-jawed, bully-brained high school jock in the '70s, odds
were you despised these things: vegetarians, members of the science club,
standardized personality tests, and the rock group Rush. Especially Rush.<p>

To many clean-cuts, Rush represents the apocalypse of rock. The band sang in
octaves high enough to make the Bee Gees blanch, wrote lyrics that vacillated
between befuddling gibberish with high-concept double-talk, and attracted the
grubbiest-looking fans this side of a Dead concert.<p>

Monday night at the United Center, Rush proved again why it has endured for
22 years despite the lack of endorsement from snobbish, pretty-boy critics:
they simply rock like hell.<p>

Covering songs from every period of its evolution (including the entirety of
"2112") Rush thrilled the near sell-out crowd with its usual display of
technical precision and lightning-quick musicianship. But the revelation this
night wasn't in individual flash, rather in the band's emergence as a
blistering and evolving rhythm unit.<p>

Staying true to the spirit of its recent stripped-down studio sound, Rush
favored lean and wicked grooves Monday night, cutting back a bit on the
elaborate solo histrionics that made them legends among wide-eyed teenagers
taking their first guitar of drum lessons. The results was a cleaner
performance in which the band's often complex songs were allowed to breathe
cleanly and throb seductively.<p>

But don't worry, speed freaks. Faster-than-Flash drummer Neil Peart continues
to serve as religious icon for two decades of hyperventalating air drummers,
many of whom recklessly whirled elbows, wrists and hair at the UC while
trying to match their hero note-for-note. And guitarist Alex Lifeson still
looks like he can keep up with furious-fingered youngsters half his age.<p>

Only bassist-singer Geddy Lee seems to have been affected by the years,
judiciously avoiding some of the ultra-high notes he once hit without
reserve. This caution was most notable during parts of "2112", when Lee
dropped his vocals an octave mid-song. But on other numbers, such as radio
hit "Closer to the Heart," he cranked it up and hit the top floor.<p>

Rush will forever be criticized for taking itself too seriously, but the
Toronto-bred trio truly looked like they were having fun Monday night. And
though many of their fans arrived bleary-eyed and still long-haired after 22
years, they, too, looked like they were having fun. That's not a bad secret
for rock critics to remember.
