<font size=+1>Band gives Peart time to grieve</font><br>
<b>by David Veitch</b><p>

Rush is not in danger of breaking up.<p>

The band is just in a holding pattern.<p>

At least, that's the viewpoint of Alex Lifeson, guitarist for the venerable
Canadian rock trio, which has no long- or short-term plans beyond the
Nov. 10 release of the triple-CD live set Different Stages.<p>

Lifeson and bassist-singer Geddy Lee are giving drummer-lyricist Neil Peart
time to grieve the loss of his wife Jackie to cancer this year, following the
death of their 19-year-old daughter in a car accident in 1997.<p>

"As far as the band is concerned, we're just waiting for Neil to really get
better," Lifeson said in a telephone interview yesterday.<p>

"I don't think he'll be the person he was, but I think he will cope with
life again.<p>

"Hopefully, eventually, he'll be able to find joy in all the things he
did in life before."<p>

Such as, presumably, playing drums and writing lyrics for Rush.<p>

"I got to think in my heart there are things about what we do that Neil
really loves a lot and is not prepared to give up," Lifeson said.<p>

But the musician admitted he and Lee, both 45, have "spent hours and hours"
talking about the tragic turn of events. They've decided there will be no
Rush without Peart.<p>

"I wouldn't do it," Lifeson said. "I love working with Ged and Ged is my best
friend.... We would probably continue working together in some form, but
I don't think it would be Rush. It would never be the same."<p>

Lifeson, a friendly and forthcoming interview, spoke with great gravity when
discussing the potential end of Rush.<p>

After all, he has spent his entire adult life in the 29-year-old band.<p>

Conversely, he spoke with great excitement about the prospect of future Rush
studio records and, of course, the imminent release of the band's fourth live
album (following 1976's All The World's A Stage, 1981's Exit ... Stage Left
and 1989's A Show of Hands).<p>

Fans will probably be most excited by Disc 3, a previously unreleased
concert recorded in 1978 at Hammersmith in London, England, during the Farewell
To Kings tour.<p>

Meanwhile, Discs 1 and 2 are live recordings culled largely from the band's
last North American tour behind the Test For Echo album. Disc 1 ends with
the title suite for Rush's 1976 breakthrough album, 2112.<p>

Local Rush fans may be particularly interested in Different Stages, as the
group bypassed Calgary on both its Counterparts and Test for Echo tours.<p>

The band last played in the city in 1990.<p>

"We don't play 180 shows any more," Lifeson explained. "The last tour was
about 84, 85 shows.... I know Neil, over the years, is less interested in
touring than perhaps he was in the past. I mean, we all go through that.<p>

"So, we only had so many days we could work and it was a case of going to
what's on the A-list."<p>

Although Rush has no future plans, Lifeson ruled out any possibility of a
compilation of unreleased material.<p>

"We've always had a policy that we only wrote and worked on songs that were
going to be on the records," he said.<p>

"So we never wrote any more music or recorded any unreleased material ever."<p>

Ever? "We've done a few things in the recording sessions, but they would
definitely get an X-rating," he offered tantalizingly.<p>

For lyrical content or musical abomination?<p>

Lifeson laughed.<p>

"Mostly lyric," he said, "but actually both when I think about it."<p>
