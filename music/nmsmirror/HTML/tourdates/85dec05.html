<font size=+1>RUSH Rocks To A Different Drummer</font><br>
<b>By Ernie Welch</b><p>

Rock 'n' roll drummers are generally viewed as volatile, undisciplined bashers 
who attack colossal drum sets as if every song were their last.<p>

Then again, there's Neil Peart of the Canadian band Rush, which performs in
the Providence Civic Center tonight and the Worcester Centrum next Thursday
and Friday. Known as "the professor," Peart is not only one of rock's most
dextrous, dramatic drummers, but an extremely prolific lyricist who also writes
Rush's biographical sketches and plans a novel.<p>

Peart, bassist-keyboardist-vocalist Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson all
hail from suburban Toronto, a hotbed for music of all idioms. :There doesn't
exist an easily definable Canadian sound," said Peart during a recent
telephone interview from his home city. "But in the '60s, Toronto, like
Detroit and Philadelphia, was influenced by black R&B. My background was in
white soul bands backing up black singer."<p>

Rush began in 1968, although Peart didn't join until 1974 when he replaced
drummer John Rutsey and assumed the lyrical chores. The band recorded several
albums in the '70s, but most were marred by a derivative, unfocused heavy
metal sound and ponderous epic fantasies such as "By-Tor and the Snow Dog" and
"The Fountain of Lamneth." A rush they were not.<p>

The band came into its own, though, in 1979 with "The Spirit of Radio," a song
reflecting a more streamlined, controlled sound, and lyrics which dealt with
emotions and reality rather than cornball mythology and futuristic symbols.<p>

"The '70s was definitely a period of schizophrenic exploration and education,"
Peart recalled. "We were never confident in our abilities, but we wanted to
improve and felt we should go about it by following our instincts and
obsessions.<p>

"Around the turn of the '80s, we started to feel more assured as both
musicians and songwriters. We were able to look at a song as just a song, and
no longer felt compelled to overdress the music in order to hide
inadequacies."<p>

Rush's work in the '80s, particularly the albums "Moving Pictures" (1981) and
the current "Power Windows," represents some of the most impressive music in
the mainstream milieu. At the core is the trio's instrumental virtuosity,
which allows the freedom to play clear, complex arrangements. Eclectic
colorings are taken from international idioms and rock artists as diverse as
Devo, the Dregs, Santana and U2.<p>

"They're all in there," said Peart. "We're a receptive audience for our
contemporaries' music, which keeps us fresh and satisfied when we create our
own. We'll never be pushed into doing solo albums because everything we like
goes into Rush."<p>

Peart's lyrics are of the grand scale variety and literary in nature. He
usually writes with one ear towards poetic and musical rhythms, and the other
to Lee's oddly distinctive voice.<p>

"When I'm working on lyrics, I perceive a theoretical, rhythmic foundation for
the words before I marshal them into order. I'm very empathetic toward Geddy,
who's a real sounding board for my ideas. If there's a line he just can't get
behind as a singer, I put it away, which doesn't tarnish the joy of writing or
the satisfaction of achieving what I wanted."<p>

One of several interesting songs on the new album is "Manhattan Project,"
which is about the United States' use of nuclear weapons during World War
II.<p>

"When I started that song, I only wanted to dramatize the event itself. But
after doing so much research, I realized just what had happened and began to
empathize with the people involved. They weren't hearless crazy monsters, just
regular, patriotic people caught up in the momentum of events."<p>

"Territories" deals with isolation on both a worldly and individual level and
includes a few of Peart's more compelling lines; "Don't feed the people but we
feed the machines/Can't really feel what international means" and "Better the
pride that resides in a citizen of the world/Than the pride that divides when
a colorful flag is unfurled."<p>

Like many of Peart's lyrical ideas, the current single "The Big Money" came
from his extensive reading. "The genesis for that song was from the first
book of the 'USA Trilogy' written by John Dos Passos in the 1920s. It dealt
with the J.P. Morgan loans and the economic causes of World War I."<p>

"I didn't want the song to be totally in the voice of a cynical anti-corporate
reactionary, though, because things like the Ford Foundation do accomplish a
lot of good. I mean the church and worth events like Live Aid are big money,
too."<p>

Peart is among a small group of rock drummers -- including Stewart Copeland of
the Police and Journey's Steve Smith -- highly revered by other drummers. But
he finds great difficulty in accepting praise. In a recent letter to Modern
Drummer magazine, Peart almost apologized for receiving the "Best Recorded
Performance Award" and even quoted one of Groucho Marx's greatest
self-deprecating lines: "I wouldn't want to be in a club that would have me
for a member."<p>

A recent recoding session, though, enabled Peart to be more appreciative of
his percussive skills. "Before we recorded the new album, I was in San
Francisco to play a session for Jeff Berlin, a highly respected jazz bassist.
The people with whom I was working were very well schooled in that area, and I
was very nervous coming in with the stigma of being a successful rock
musician. All I was called upon to do, though, was a good job, which I did.
The satisfaction level was enormous and carried through into the recording of
the 'Power Windows' album."<p>

Peart is a very private person who rarely answers personal questions and is
uncomfortable with the backstage scene.<p>

"I love meeting people on equal terms, when they have no idea who I am. For
instance, I recently traveled on a steamer up the east coast of China. While
standing on the bow to watch the waves, I saw a Chinese fellow who seemed to
share my love for the sea. Throughout the voyage we would cross paths on the
way to the bow and just smile at each other. There was something shared there
and I'll never forget that person. At the same time I probably won't forget
someone who comes screaming up to me backstage, grabs me and tells me how
wonderful I am -- but for a totally different reason."<p>

One major criticism of Rush is that the band's music is overly technical and
arty, too dispassionate to be considered true rock 'n' roll. Peart considers
it a flimsy observation.<p>

"To be good musicians has always been an obsession with this band. To make our
songs different and interesting, to grow and keep changing is what we love.
The fact that we take a lot of care about it doesn't put any distance between
us and the music.<p>

"You know there's not that many bands making really honest music. We feel that
we're following the true course of our profession. What could be more
passionate than that?"<p>
