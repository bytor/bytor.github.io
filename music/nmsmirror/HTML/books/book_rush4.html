  <font size=+2>D</font>uring the interviews they gave on the British tour Rush revealed
that 'Hemispheres' had taken them much longer to record than any other
album they'd been involved in - two and a half months of recording
alone at Rockfield before they even got down to mixing at Trident.<p>

  Alex Lifeson explained one of the reasons was that it had been the
most "arranged" of all their albums which, paradoxically, meant that
since they had a clearer idea of what they wanted to do it took them
longer to achieve exactly that result.<p>

  They had planned to spend just on six weeks recording 'Hemispheres'
but, as Peart pointed out, at the same time as they had progressed
through their musical career, they had become more exacting in their
demands upon themselves.<p>

  He told one interviewer: "Our standards are very high. Second best
isn't good enough."<p>

  In addition, while they were here, the band and their management let
slip a couple of reminders to the media to show that it still wasn't
easy going for Rush in Britain, or most other places for that matter,
as far as mass media acceptance was concerned. The band were very big
among the public of quite a few countries around the world but press
and radio were still taking a cautious view of them.<p>

  Co-manager Ray Danniels said, comparing the Max Webster and Rush
situation: "The press have gone for Max Webster straight away yet Rush
has been a band they have seemed to want to avoid." He added hastily,
however, "But it doesn't affect the band."<p>

  Alex Lifeson, when asked if he'd read the British reviews of
'Hemispheres' said that he'd only read Geoff Barton's in Sounds and
hadn't seen the ones in MM or NME because "They don't like us very
much anyway." Even then he probably hadn't derived too much joy from
Geoff's since the latter had indicated his own personal confusion over
'Hemispheres' feeling it was either a masterpiece or a terrible
mistake.<p>

  To his credit Barton subsequently stated that he stood by what he
said in the 'Hemispheres' review but added he was probably pretty much
alone in his opinion and that that particular album had bust Rush's
potential market wide open, bringing the Yes-type fans alongside the
masses of heavy metal fanatics.<p>

  Aside from that the point remains that Rush's coverage in the papers
and their exposure on radio in no way reflected their enormous
popularity. By now, however, I believe even that didn't really bother
the three very much. They had succeeded despite being ignored and were
now in a position to ignore the pundits.<p>

  Happily, they never did. From the first day I met them until now
they have always been unfailingly polite towards the rock press and
enormously helpful. And they still maintain their strict rota of doing
interviews in turn.<p>

  <font size=+2>A</font>nyway, back to the narrative. After the British dates Rush headed
for the Continent where they were due to open a European tour in
Paris, on May 15. Unfortunately the hall burnt down - fortunately
before they'd got there - so that was rescheduled. The band opened in
Belgium and went on through Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden and
Norway. That series went on until the middle of June, 1979. Then it
was back to Canada for a break - their first since October of the
previous year and the first for more than 150 concerts.<p>
                  
  However, within a month of their getting back home, it was announced
in the music papers that Rush would be coming back to the UK to do a
one-off show at the massive, barn-like Stafford Bingley Hall on
September 21. The reason, according to the papers, was that Rush were
planning to record their next album in the UK - the betting was on
Trident in London as the favoured studio - and that they would take
the opportunity to play a special concert here.<p>
                  
  There had been such an overwhelming demand for tickets on the
previous visit that Rush felt they should give the fans who had missed
them a chance to see the band - and the people surrounding Rush
obviously felt highly confident they'd have no trouble filling the
10,000 plus capacity hall.<p>

  No trouble? Too right - because within a week of the date being
announced it had been sold out and the promoters, Straight Music,
quickly organised another one for the following night. All in all
20,000 tickets sold without too much trouble at all - if anyone needed
confirmation that Rush were a major act they had only to look at those
figures.<p>

  However, those shows were still in the future and in the meantime
Rush were taking a well-earned rest before settling down to work on
new material for the upcoming album. This was a deliberate and
conscious change for Rush compared with their previous style of doing
things. In effect this had been a question of touring just about all
the time and taking the long dead hours that every band endures on
tour - travelling, sitting in hotel rooms etc. - to use as writing
time.<p>

  <font size=+2>F</font>or the new album - 'Permanent Waves', as it turned out to be titled-
Rush moved themselves off to a place called Lakewoods Farm in Ontario
where Peart locked himself away in a cottage, adjoining the farm, and
got down to work on the Iyrics. While he was beavering away in
splendid isolation Lifeson was playing about with his guitars and
Geddy was accustoming himself to his ever burgeoning collection of
instruments, mainly electronic.<p>

  The first thing that they actually cobbled together was an
instrumental given the intriguing nonsense title of 'Uncle Tounous' -
basically a workout of different ideas and a testing ground for
musical effects. You won't find 'Uncle Tounous' on any album. Instead
it was what one might consider as a prototype, ideas which were
incorporated into, or formed the basis for, a whole collection of
different songs and tunes.<p>

  First to be finished were 'Spirit Of Radio', 'Free Will' and
'Jacob's Ladder'. These songs, and others from 'Waves' were to be
dusted off on dates that the band had fixed up for around the same
time as the recording for the album, including the British dates at
Stafford.<p>

  The track on the album which took the longest time was 'Natural
Science'. Rush had finished doing the demos for everything on the
album except one track. They had moved from Lakewoods Farrn to Le
Studio in Montreal to begin recording in earnest, but there was still
that gap.<p>

  For a while it looked as though something Neil had been working on,
based on the medieval epic 'Sir Gawain & The Green Knight' might fill
the gap, but it wasn't to be.<p>

  "It became too out of place with the album's other material",
explained Neil "so the project was shelved. But this did leave us with
a gaping hole in the LPs plan. So while Alex and Geddy worked on
overdubs I secluded myself to try to write something.<p>

  "For two days I stared in frustration at blank sheets of paper but
on the third day something began to take shape, eventually taking the
form of 'Natural Science', the album's concluding track."<p>

  The album was mixed at Trident on their British jaunt and it was
eventually released in January, 1980. Two of the album's songs,
'Spirit Of Radio' and 'Free Will' were heard for the first time in the
UK at the Bingley Hall shows and, significantly, the former received a
tumultuous response. Almost on a par, in fact, with the classic
'Farewell To Kings'. The show that I went to - the first - was a
complete and utter triumph for the band. I'm told by others who went
to the second show that that one went equally well.<p>

  The band played for about two hours each night, punctuating their
show with their spectacular light show. By the time it was over that
first night the crowd filed out in an almost reverent fashion, as
though they'd been witnesses to a religious experience, more than a
rock concert.<p>

  To support the release of 'Permanent Waves' Rush fixed up an
exhausting schedule - as usual - which was set to cover most of North
America from January through until the middle part May. A European
tour was mooted to begin in May.<p>

  With the album released in January tickets went on sale for dates
throughout Canada and the United States. On the record front the band
enjoyed spectacular success with 'Permanent Waves' spiralling up the
album charts and eventually making Five in the three majors -
Billboard, Cashhox and Record World.<p>

  In Britain it made number three. However, as heartening as those
performances were to the band, its record company and management, they
must have been absolutely stunned by the way the single, 'Spirit Of
Radio', exploded worldwide. For the first time ever Rush had a
genuine, certified worldwide hit single. A few weeks earlier David
Fricke in Circus magazine had recorded this little scenario, which
illustrates all the more starkly how Rush had done previously with
singles.<p>
    
  The disc jockey at CHOM-FM, Montreal, is winding up a radio
interview with Geddy Lee, singer and bass guitarist with Rush.
Ploughing desperately through a pile of Rush albums on the floor,
while the last record fades out, he finally looks at Lee with a
nervous smile. 'Let's go out with a hit'."<p>

  "A hit?" Lee looks genuinely puzzled. "We don't have any hits."<p>

  But a hit they did have with 'Spirit Of Radio' and, of course, with
'Permanent Waves' which indicated that the long hard years of slogging
around were paying off in a major way. On the concert front this kind
of acceptance was being demonstrated in a spectacular fashion
throughout North America with sell- outs being reported within hours
of tickets going on sale and shows being added on all over the place.<p>
    
  <font size=+2>T</font>he fervour for Rush was very nearly demonstrated in tragic fashion
in Detroit in January. A month previously - December 3 to be exact - 11
fans had been killed in Riverfront Stadium in Cinncinnati when the
crowd rushed the gates at a Who concert.<p>

  Rush nearly had their own Cincinnati when tickets for their February
17 show went on sale at the massive Cobo Hall in Detroit on Saturday,
January 12.<p>

  There were between 1,000 and 1,500 kids waiting in line to buy
tickets when the box office was opened at 8.30 a.m. - an hour and a
half earlier than the planned time. The box office manager had opened
early because of the crowd, some of whom - according to local police -
had been waiting all night in near freezing temperatures. With eight
police on duty the crowds rushed the doors, smashed the glass in six
of them and tore another two literally off their hinges.<p>

  Another dozen cops were called and restored order with the judicious
use of nightsticks - the lengthier American version of the humble
truncheon. To get people to move back they hit them on the legs with
their clubs.<p>

  Through some sort of minor miracle no-one was seriously injured
although several reported being trampled to the ground. Eventually all
20,029 tickets for the gig were sold out.<p>

  At about the same time Rush had made it clear in the American press
that they were concerned to a very great extent with the question of
safety of their audiences at concerts.<p>

  Rush specified in their contracts that there would be no "festival
seating" - which is an American promoters' euphemism for taking out
the seats and squeezing as many people as possible into a gig without
regard for safety.<p>

  Said Geddy Lee: "It's really ignorant It's treating kids like
cattle, which they're not. It's something we've fought for a long time
but nobody listens to you. They need a horrible tragedy like this (The
Who Cincinnati incident) before they'll go 'Oh yeah, maybe you're
right'.<p>
  "We've complained on a lot of our past shows. Can't we please have
reserved seating all the time, but unfortunately no-one really paid
attention until this incident happened."<p>

  Lee concluded 'You never hear of riots in reserved seating. That's
really what it boils down to."<p>

  Neil Peart echoed Geddy's feelings. "I'm very happy we have a clause
in our contract that allows for no festival seating. I tried to go for
it during the last tour because over the past few years I have been
watching people go through so much suffering at the front of the stage
  people being pulled out of the audience bv their feet and people
just being pushed back and forth. It's terrible to watch."<p>
                          
  Despite their reserved seating only contract rider, Rush still
managed to pull in some incredibly vast crowds on their American tour
  the biggest they'd ever attracted and proof positive that they were
a massive band.<p>

   Just take a look at some of the figures. Down in Wichita they
 pulled in 7,300 kids at the Kansas Coliseum. In Los Angeles at the
 Inglewood Forum they attracted more than 10,000 who paid a total of
 102,000 dollars to see the band. On their West Coast section of their
 tour Rush pulled in more than 41,000 fans.<p>

  The Cleveland Coliseum saw them before an 18,000 strong audience,
Edmonton had 15,000, Fort Worth in Texas 13,000 and so on.<p>

  They played four nights in Chicago, four in New York, two in Seattle
  all this went on from January through until May. Perhaps the most
startling area of all was St Louis. They played three nights in the
town the first time any rock band had played a major venue there three
times in a row, and all told 30,000 local inhabitants saw their two
hour plus show.<p>

  In one week alone - February 13 to 19 - the band generated more than
half a million dollars worth of ticket sales - 584,095 to be exact -
with those remarkable series of shows in St Louis and Detroit making
more than 200,000 and 250,000 dollars respectively.<p>

  The pattern was repeated all across the country. But if the figures
seem spectacular - which they are, to be honest - what's even more
surprising is that later Alex Lifeson was to say that the 'Permanent
Waves' tour was the first one from which Rush actually showed a
profit.<p>

  That was undoubtedly due to the sheer scale of the Rush touring
operation. They travelled around America with some 600,000 dollars
worth of stage gear, sound equipment and that light show, plus a road
crew in the region of two dozen - all of which was transported in four
big trucks, a couple of buses and a magnificently appointed camper
boasting just about anything the 1980s traveller could desire.<p>

  <font size=+2>I</font>f the sheer statistics of the Permanent Waves' tour are impressive
the turn-about in the attitude of the critics on the other side of the
Atlantic was equally impressive. The band were finally recognized in
most quarters as one of the most impressive outfits stage-wise on the
road. In addition, Neil Peart's Iyrics and the sheer, outstanding
musicianship of all three members were getting the attention and the
praise they had deserved for so long.<p>

  The Cleveland show was rated as one of the finest performances ever
seen in the town. "Rush" said the reviewer "lives up to, and also
sets, standards that all touring bands of the Eighties must follow."<p>

  In Wichita the local critic raved over their "phenomenal
musicianship" while in Calgary the reviewer felt that Rush had showed
a capacity crowd that "heavy metal was far from dead." As a final
example, down in St Louis it was said that Rush had progressed "into
one of the foremost musical forces and performing ensembles in the
world." The writer added that the band had entered "an elite circle at
the pinnacle of international rock."<p>

  Of course it wasn't all rave reviews. The Kansas City man felt that
Rush were predictable, too loud and too reliant on visual and musical
spectacle. The reporter added that the band had "brought down the
house, nevertheless."<p>

  Up in New York State the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle popular
arts editor, Jack Garner, reserved a special mention for Geddy. Having
trashed the band generally he moved on to specifics. "The hardest
thing to take is vocalist hassist Geddy Lee whose voice MUST be an
acquired taste. He sounds like Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant would sound
if someone jumped off the other end of a seesaw."<p>

  It's probably fair to say that Rush themselves didn't much care
about the reviews - good or bad. They'd been vindicated by the public
and had no real need to worry about the professional pundits. Also,
from a purely fiscal point of view, according to manager Ray Danniels,
the band had started the tour around 300,000 dollars in debt and after
it, for the first time in their careers they were completely in
profit.<p>

  Danniels pointed out to a reporter in Toronto that the band could
have made a lot more money, a lot earlier in their careers but it was
their insistence on doing things their own way that had prevented them
from doing so.<p>

  He said that the band insisted on playing smaller, less profitable
gigs in areas which had been loyal to them in the past because they
preferred to return that loyalty - at some financial cost to
themselves - than go for the big bucks instantly. Given that - which
to me, as a close observer of the band, seems fair and accurate - the
mind reels back from the astronomical amount of money they could have
made on that historic 'Permanent Waves' jaunt.<p>

  After the Los Angeles Forum show on that tour Rush were dragged back
to a reception for the music biz where a reporter recorded them as
holding themselves aloof from the others present. Neil was said to be
continually looking for the exit, Geddy zipped into a remote corner
and Alex popped himself into an alcove where people could see him but
not touch him."<p>

  Why? Because they hate events like this. Geddy was quoted as saying,
at this particular event "Who are these people? I don't care if this
is L.A. These people in radio, in the record industry, they never
supported us getting here. The kids did. We were pressured into being
here and smiling. We shouldn't be here."<p>

  I've seen them do much the same thing on several occasions in
Britain - willing to take to people who had stuck with them throughout
the leaner times: in fact, not so much willing as positively eager.
But then, maybe an hour into the reception you turn round to see where
they are and they've gone.<p>

  It's just that they're keen to avoid being wrapped up in the music
business and if they've got time to spare after a gig they'd sooner
spend it talking to kids and signing autographs than sit around with
record company salesmen who are busily gulping down record company
wine and scoffing record company food.<p>

  Says Neil: "We're finding it easier to say no. This can be a pretty
sleazy business and I can understand people getting wrapped up in it
all. But we've learned what we should do."<p>

  Perhaps Ray Danniels summed their attitude up best when he said
"They may not go to cocktail parties and like it but they'll do the
longest set in the business for the people who've paid for it."<p>
                           
  The fans were repaying Rush in kind on the record sales front by
making 'Permanent Waves' go gold in the States, platinum in Canada and
silver in Britain - all within two months of the album's release.<p>

  Furthermore, in April 1980, Sounds and Melody Maker published the
results of their annual readers polls. Rush and each individual member
of the band were placed in the top ten of each applicable category in
both polls - a magnificent achievement when the music papers were
telling us that Johnny Rotten's new band Public Image Limited was the
only group worth listening to.<p>

  However, among the music press there were certain specialist heavy
metal writers who enthused mightily about 'Permanent Waves'. Malcolm
Dome in Record Mirror said that while the album didn't quite reach
"the classic heights of 'Hemispheres' nonetheless Lee, Lifeson and
Peart have come up with half a dozen persuasive reasons for breaking
out the champagne and celebrating the new decade".<p>

  Dome also recommended the album as an answer to punters who thought
intelligent heavy metal was the figment of a half crazed reviewer's
warped sense of humour. If 'Freewill' and 'Spirit Of Radio' did
nothing for the listener, he added, then he should get back and wallow
in the sounds of boredom from Genesis and The Eagles.<p>

  <font size=+2>J</font>ohn Gill in Sounds suggested that it was the Rush album to end all
Rush albums. The album, he said, "finds Rush healthier than ever,
fresher than ever and with a keen eye on their future. Gone are the
days of the side- long epics and science fantasy myths, their place
taken by Rush music 80's style, expert, awesome, energetic and aware."<p>

  Gill went on to suggest that 'Permanent Waves' could become Neil
Peart's definitive statement - "as it's the most philosophical Rush
album to date", and without the assistance of allegories straight off
the shelves of 'Dark They Were And Golden Eyed' - the last being a
store in London that specialised in science fiction books, magazines
etc, much of which was on the 'sword and sorcery' side.<p>

  Melody Maker's Steve Gett zeroed in on the shorter length of the
tracks, suggesting that if Rush had continued with their "mammoth
tales of black holes in space" they might well have reached a
stalemate.<p>

  Gett reckoned that 'Hemispheres had been the closing stage of that
particular phase of the band's career and that 'Permanent Waves'
marked the beginning of a new one. However, Gett also entered a caveat
concerning Neil's new Iyrical subject matter, expressing pleasure that
they weren't so contrived as in the past and that Neil was no longer
delivering his messages in the guise of a Tolkien fantasy.<p>

  "But", warned Gett, "what he's writing now seems to imply social
comment and one wonders whether Rush fans understand or care about
what he's trying to say. I'm sure that listeners are more responsive
to a Lifeson guitar solo than to erudite verse."<p>

  Naturally it was left to NME to come in with all guns blazing among
the four major music papers in the UK But, to be fair, reviewer Paul
Du Noyer made a considerable effort to seek out what he considered the
good parts of the album before slamming the bad bits.<p>

  Basically this boiled down to an acceptance of the music as being a
good example of its genre but at the same time having an exceedingly
wary and jaundiced view of Neil's Iyrics and attitudes.<p>

  The album, said Du Noyer "can only serve to consolidate Rush's
enormous popularity because it is undeniably superior high production
heavy rock, powerful and glossy. Within the given limitations of the
genre, this is inventive stuff, with a degree of intelligence and
sensitivity that's not to be found around too many of their rivals."<p>

  But on the Iyrics Du Noyer felt they were "hardly the substance of
Art, however defined - more like the first faltering efforts of an
averagely bright 13 year old who's deeply into Rod McKuen."<p>

  And, as far as the Iyrics went to any kind of social or
philosophical comment, Du Noyer was even less sure. He described the
band's "proudly reactionary stance" as muddled and shallow - "an ill-
argued dog's dinner of Plato, Milton Friedman and Patience Strong."
Even if you don't like what Du Noyer was saying about Rush you've
still got to admire his turn of phrase.<p>

  In the States the reviews were equally mixed with John Swenson,
writing in Creem, definitely coming good on the side of those who
hated it.<p>

  "Criticizing them" he wrote, referring to their past efforts "would
have been like going fishing without water. But this grim Canadian
trio has done something so remarkable I can no longer hold my tongue -
after seven tries, Rush has finally made a good album."<p>
                          
  Mind you, Swenson's idea of good probably wouldn't tally with most
peoples ideas. In the context of 'Waves' he rates as good something
which wouldn't make you forget The Rolling Stones but would make you
glad that Emerson, Lake and Palmer had hung up their flying
synthesisers.<p>
                           
  "This", he said "is art rock in all its pretentious, desperately
self-justifying glory - and lead singer Geddy Lee still sounds like an
eunuch Jerry Vale at 78 rpm."<p>
                           
  His final coup de grace - in a review consisting of nothing but
coups de grace - was: "the band now clocks in a little ahead of Uriah
Heep on the art rockometer, a substantial advance."<p>
                           
  Rolling Stone's David Fricke was far more on the ball and to the
point. He wrote: "It's easy to criticize what you can't understand
which at least partly explains why Canadian power trio Rush have
suffered so much at the hands of rock journalists since the band's
debut album in 1974." Fricke dished out praise all round and concluded
with one of the most perceptive remarks ever committed to print by a
rock journalist on the subject of Rush.<p>

  "Rush's problem has rarely been competence. They simply don't play
fashionable music. If they couldn't cut it on their own terms it would
be different but this band is among the very best in its genre.<p>
  "And, if the Top Five status of 'Permanent Waves' is any example
it's a genre wherein critics don't count at all."<p>

  And that's exactly the point the band were trying to make with the
album and its title. Neil Peart said 'Permanent Waves' was intended as
a dig at the British music press which, he reasoned, by virtue of
being weekly was desperate for new people to write about every week.
As a result the press was either killing off somebody or raising up
someone else as the "unheralded new God."<p>
