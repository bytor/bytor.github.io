Note From Neil<br>
--------------</font><p>

   For almost twenty years I have made the time to answer everybody who
has written to me through <strong>Modern Drummer</strong>.  A couple of times a year I
would set aside a whole day and spend it reading these letters and writing
out postcards in response -- at first by hand and later on the keyboard --
answering each letter individually and uniquely (i.e. no form letters).<p>

   By now the total of those responses would number in the <strong>thousands</strong>,
but I was always able to keep up with them at my own pace.  Because I was
careful never to talk about it in interviews and such, the numbers stayed
under control -- it remained "our little secret."  Until now.<p>

   In the last year or so the number of letters has doubled or tripled all
of the sudden, and although it might be flattering to consider this just a
reflection of my ever-growing <strong>popularity</strong>, I know that's not the case.<p>

   All it took was a few people to go on the World-Wide GossipNet and start
telling people that I had answered their letters through 
<strong>Modern Drummer</strong>, and the floodgates were open.  These big 
mouths (or big <strong>fingers</strong>) have spoiled it for everyone.<p>

   Including me.  Personally, I feel terrible about this situation, for it
has always given me a glow of satisfaction to spend that time on a little
bit of altruism -- knowing that I might bring a smile to these people's
faces, or even encourage them a little bit.  However, this is not something
I want to devote my <strong>life</strong> to, and as I face the ever-growing pile of mail
in the corner of my office, I know I will never again be able to keep up
with it.<p>

   So to any of you whose personal messages and requests reside in that
pile, I offer my sincere apologies for not answering them.  This unfortunate
consequence of the much-vaunted Inter-thingy is a shame, and I do regret it.<p>

   But hey -- it was good while it lasted!<p>
