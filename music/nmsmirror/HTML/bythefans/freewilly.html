<font size=+3>Free Willy</font><br>
by Shawn Clayton Knight<br>
<em>July 7, 1997</em><p>

There are those who think that porno films are just great;<br>
A host of whoring scandals to impress your latest date ...<p>

_The Planet of Apethings_, or something even worse;<br>
Producers we cannot believe ...<br>
The star's out tonight, and the acting just bites;<br>
_Fame_ has got to be better than _Speed_ ...<p>

CHORUS:<br>
You can choose a Disney film or something else for kids;<br>
You can watch a crappy flick or something that's the pits.<br>
You can choose "Kiss Meets the Phantom" or something else that's silly;<br>
I will choose a film that's bad - I will choose "Free Willy".<p>

There are those who think that movies are just way too bland;<br>
The plots are so contrived and they could really use a hand ...<p>

Horror we hate, or biker girls in chains;<br>
Or "Waltons: The Family Estate";<br>
Watch Torgo's knees, inflated with fleas,<br>
In "Manos, the (Big) Hands of Fate" ...<p>

CHORUS<p>

Violence, and social awareness,<br>
_Split Second_ and _Home Alone_;<br>
Cinematic crap, the _Pulp Fiction_ flap,<br>
Can't stand them unless we get stoned ...<p>

CHORUS<p>
