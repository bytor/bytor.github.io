<h3>Rush Sticks to Polished Routine</h3>
Canadian trio hasn't swayed from its '70s arena-rock sound
<p>
<h4>by Joel Selvin, Chronicle Staff Critic</h4><p>

While paying sufficient obeisance to arena-rock cliches to keep the masses 
entertained, Rush manages enough individuality not to be subordinated by the
steady procession of lights, films, laser beams and the like.<p>

Maybe that helps explain how the Canadian hard rock trio continues to flourish
almost 15 years after first advancing into headliner status without really
altering their style.<p>

In the first of two sold-out shows Wednesday and Thursday at the Oakland
Coliseum Arena, Rush displayed flawless production, admirable musicianship
and just enough of a singular vision to make the band's artistic statement
stand out without straining the imagination of the enthusiastic, largely male
following.<p>

<strong>WELL-WORN BLEND</strong><p>

Mix a little Pink Floyd, some Who and a healthy dose of the progressive rock
of Yes, ELP and other similar troglodytes from the early '70s and you have the
basic components for Rush's sound. Add the high-pitched voice of bassist Geddy
Lee, who sounds like he's just inhaled nitrous oxide at times, and a penchant
for lyrical allusions to science fiction and that about does it.<p>

Not that the band doesn't practice this well-worn blend with considerable
polish and a well-developed ease. The often brilliant orchestrations of the
simple three-piece band sometimes approached a fullness and lushness far
beyond what generally can be expected from a guitar-bass-drums unit.<p>

During the two-hour show, the band drew selections from a full array of Rush's
18 albums, with a liberal helping of the recent "Roll the Bones," an album
widely hailed as the band's most accessible yet. Indeed, songs like "Ghost of
a Chance" sported a greater degree of melodiousness than usual from a group
that specializes in a dense, brittle wall of accomplished, intricate
instrumental work.<p>

<strong>RABBITS IN ROUTINE</strong><p>

But the band still relied on a stream of arena-rock entertainments; from the
film clips mixing live action with animation that played on the giant screen
at the rear of the stage to green laser beams that swept the hall at regular
intervals. Computerized lights, a secondary sound system in the rear of the
hall for a surround-sound feel, a spinning drum stand, plastic inflatable
giant rabbits and a stagecraft set design all contributed to the routine.
Drummer Neil Peart even supplied a seven-minute drum solo.<p>

Guitarist Alex Lifeson kept his more extravagant inclinations in check,
working primarily in an ensemble mode, building cacophonies in synch with
Peart and Lee, who added occasional touches of synthesizer in addition to his
fluid, riveting bass lines.<p>

Somewhere underneath all this regulation folderol lies a unique floor plan, a
personal twist to this old-fashioned, unrepentant '70s rock that allows Rush
to endure and prosper. It may, in fact, be the band's refusal to allow any
outside influences to shape the band -- punk, new wave, post-modernism have
all come and gone without making a dent on Rush -- that is responsible for the
enormous loyalty the band commands.<p>

One thing is for sure: nobody mistakes them for Mahogany Rush anymore.<p>
