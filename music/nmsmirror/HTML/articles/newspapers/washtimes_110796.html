<font size=+1>RUSH TO STAY AHEAD OF THE REST<br>
Innovative Band has been around for two decades</font><br>
<b>by Gerald Mizejewski</b><p>

The cover art of the newly release compact disc shows a breathtaking, fresh 
shot of rock climbers hoisting themselves up a Stonehenge-like formation.<p>

The vivid, full-color photos in the liner notes serve as a superb framework 
around lyrical poems containing themes detailing the human need for affirmation.
<p>

But it's the progressive music on the disc -- with varying tempos, clean drum 
progressions and crisp vocals urging reason -- that stands out the most.<P>

A chart-topper?  Maybe an unknown band off the L.A. club circuit making its 
way toward the MTV Buzz Bin?  Maybe its the next HFStival headliner.<p>

At first glance -- and listen -- you'd think this was some hot young group 
straight out of Berklee College of Music.  Not by a long shot.<p>

It's Rush, the rock group that stays a step ahead of its competition -- and 
their age -- through constant reinvention and innovation.  The Toronto-based 
band assembled two decades ago is back at it again -- for the 21st time.  The 
trio that turns out solid albums year after year offers trademark musicianship, 
confrontation with pertinent issues, and a resulting high volume of record 
sales via its latest creation, "Test for Echo."<p>

"It was the most enjoyable [album] for us," says guitarist Alex Lifeson from 
his hotel room somewhere outside Detroit.  "We were very unified in what the 
direction was.  I think it shows on this album."<p>

Unification, it seems, was not the only change that Rush experienced since the 
1994 release of "Counterparts," a fast-paced concept album chock-full of 
philosophy, from rational objectivism (a focus on the individual) to the study 
of complex relationships.  Vocalist-bassist Geddy Lee, percussionist Neil 
Peart and Mr. Lifeson took 18 months between albums to go their separate 
ways.<p>

"I spent 10 months writing and recording 'Victor,'" says Mr. Lifeson, 43, of 
his first solo album since helping form the band in 1973.  "I had two weeks 
off and then came 'Test.'  Coming off the side project, I was very focused on 
songwriting and arranging.<p>

"I felt a lot more confident and stronger."<p>

The band took such a long hiatus after finishing its last tour in May 1994 
because "Geddy wanted a year off to be with his new daughter and Neil always 
has a lot of things going on,"  Mr. Lifeson says.<p>

Mr. Peart, the lyrical brainchild of the
band, took drum lessons from Freddie Gruber.<p>

"This is Neil Peart, who I think is the best
drummer in the world.  He felt there was an
area that needed to be improved,"  Mr.
Lifeson says.  "He wanted to learn to play
with more of a swing groove.<p>

"He now has a circular, fluid technique, not
a linear form of playing like he used to
have.  His endurance is greater."<p>

In October 1995 the band assembled their new
and old experiences at Chalet Studio, a
country retreat outside Toronto.<p>

"We spent the first few days talking about
where we were going as people.  We didn't
even talk about the music," says Mr. Lifeson,
who has long since traded in his long, blond
hair and double-neck guitar for a
conservative, Dutch-boy do and a sleek Paul Reed Smith guitar.<p>

>From his desk that overlooked Lake Ontario,
Mr. Peart, 44, began "sending a stream of
lyrics to the small studio at the other end
of the house, where Geddy and Alex hunched
over guitars and computers," explains Mr.
Peart in the "Test for Echo" biographical
press release he has written on behalf of the band.<p>

A snowstorm and several months later, the
album was mixed by Andy Wallace (Nirvana,
Rage Against the Machine, Faith No More).<p>

"When we heard his mix of a song for the
first time, invariably we'd say something
like, 'Wow, I never thought of it like that
before!'" Mr. Peart says.<p>

Now, about a year after settling down to
work, the band is back on tour, hitting 70
venues in an effort to please the fans.<p>

"Touring does not play an important role as
it did in the past.  We all are really
enjoying the chance to spend time with our
families...and the grueling nature turns up
off," Mr. Lifesone said.  "But we realize
there is a large following that wants to see
us.  We try to reach a balance."<p>

Lucky for the fans, playlists for the 1996
tour have included classic favorites "The
Trees" from 1978's "Hemispheres"; "Natural
Science" from the 1980;s "Permanent Waves";
"YYZ" and "Red Barchetta" from 1981's "Moving
Pictures"; and, for the first time ever, the
entire Ayn Rand-inspired "2112" medley from
1976's "2112."<p>
