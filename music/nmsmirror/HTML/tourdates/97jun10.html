3 Rush hours of hard-driving rock</font><br>
<strong>by Steve Slommrek</strong><p>
<font size=-1>Star rating: **** (out of four)</font><p>

It was All the World's a Stage all over again Tuesday night, only better.<p>

Exhibiting energy that belied their age, the members of Rush sent an exuberant 
crowd of 9,257 into a frenzy at Deer Creek Music Center. Tuesday's concert 
could well have taken place in the mid-1970s, when the live Stage album was 
released.<p>

But it's 20 years later, and Rush is so much wiser. The power trio of
singer/bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil Peart
matched that electricity of bygone days with a sense of purpose found in their
1980s-and-up era.<p>

The result was a true breadth of understanding on how to throw a great concert
that stimulates the ear and mind.<p>

But mostly the ear. Rush proved again that they can lay claim to one of the
best line groups out there. Tuesday, they rocked -- and rocked loudly -- with
virtuosic anthems and clean-sounding radio tunes for more than three hours,
with a 20-minute intermission.<p>

It was a can't lose situation for the band's devoted fans. Together, the group
sounded tight and fast, as illustrated on "Driven" and "Red Barchetta." But on
virtually every song, all three were able to strut their individualism. Lee
watched in admiration as Lifeson performed remarkable lead guitar work on
"Limelight." Lifeson did the same to Lee on "Limbo." And both of them, as well
as the crowd, had their eyes glued on the magical hands and wrists of
Peart.<p>

During the second set, Peart pounded away, "showing off" his speed and power,
during what would normally be called a drum solo. Instead, this was a drum
showcase.<p>

One of the highlights of the night was a well-performed "Closer to the Heart,"
with a perfect lead and bass guitar harmony, followed by the classic
20-plus-minute "2112." Much to the crowd's delight, this was played in its
entirety, just like on the '70s album.<p>

The crowd appeared at its happiest during "Spirit of Radio," jumping and
dancing to the popular hit.<p>

Indeed, Rush showed loads of spirit during that song and virtually all the
others. Even at this stage in their career.<p>
