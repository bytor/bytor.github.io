<font size=+3>THE BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD VERSION OF 2112</font><br>
by Andrea Zane Tawil<br>
<em>July 9, 1996</em><p>

<em>
(the scene: beavis and butthead sitting in the 20th century version
of their ultimate living room pit.  Butthead begins to speak)</em><p>

BUTTHEAD: "Uh, I like can't sleep and stuff.  I'm like looking at
megadon and the city and sky and stuff...and it sucks.  The Twin
Moons, just two pale orbs-<p>

BEAVIS: huh-huh, you said "orbs"<p>

BUTTHEAD: Oh yeah (5 minutes of moronic laughing) That was pretty
cool.  So like, life was cool.  I used to watch Megadonian Watch
on the Templevision and watch the chicks shake their thingies.<p>

BEAVIS: Yeah! Yeah! And um, my friend Beavis said it didn't suck as
much here as it did on other planets.  (Begins to get...dare I say,
more serious)  I believed what I was told.  I thought it was a good
life.  Then...<p>

BUTTHEAD: (Inturrupting and pointing at Beavis)  Uh, he's not my
friend.  He's just some dillhole who follows me around when I'm not
kicking his ass.<p>

BEAVIS: Shut up Butthead!  I'm gonna kick YOUR ass!<p>

(Beavis and Butthead start fighting as the Overture kicks in.  As the
music draws to a close, we see Stewart standing on top of a hill in an
Alanis Morrisette T-shirt)<p>

STEWART: And the meek shall inherit the earth.<p>

<strong>II Temples of Syrinx<p></strong>

BEAVIS:  So like, there's these temples everywhere.  And they suck!
The priests keep telling us what do, like to go to work and read books
and stuff.  Buttknockers.<p>

(We now see a 20th century classroom, where Sgt. Buzz *sorry, can't
remember his real name*, the ex-marine gym teacher from hell recites
his own version of "Temples of Syrinx" )<p>

SGT BUZZ: LISTEN UP YOU PANTY WIPES<p>

We took care of everything!  Everything you hear and sing and see is
decided by us.  DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT YOU PATHETIC SPECIMIN
OF MANHOOD?  We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx.  We control
the gift of life to be given or wasted on you peons!<p>

<strong>III. Discovery<p></strong>

BUTTHEAD: Uh, we were like, by the waterfall.  'Cuz sometimes the
priestesses of syrinx go to swim there and, huh-huh, you can see
their..huh-huh-huh-huh<p>

BEAVIS: Yeah!  GOING-OING-OING!!!<p>

BUTTHEAD: Huh-huh.  Morning wood.<p>

BEAVIS: Um, there were no chicks there, which sucked.  But then we saw
this thing.  We didn't know what it was, but it was cool...<p>

(flasback to Beavis and Butthead standing behind the waterfall holding
the guitar as the music plays)<p>

BUTTHEAD: What can this strange device be?  When I touch it-<p>

BEAVIS: Heh-heh, you said "Touch it"<p>

BUTTHEAD: Damnit Beavis, if you interrupt me one more time, I'm gonna
kick your ass! (Continues...) It's got wires that vibrate, and-<p>

BEAVIS: heh-heh, you said "vibra--" AAAAH! (screams as Butthead
backhands him across the face)<p>

BUTTHEAD: I said shut up, butt knocker!<p>

BEAVIS: Well quit talking like a wuss, and stop calling me butt
knocker!!<p>

BUTTHEAD:(laughing) Butt knocker.<p>

BEAVIS: Ahh! Shut up butthead, I'm gonna kill you!<p>

(Scene of Beavis and Butthead fighting fades into them fooling around
with the guitar)<p>

BUTTHEAD: Hey Beavis, lets take this thing to the temple.  Everyone
will think we're cool.<p>

BEAVIS: Yeah, and I bet we'll get lots of chicks!<p>

BUTTHEAD: Yeah. We're gonna score.<p>

<strong>IV.  Presentation<p></strong>

BEAVIS:  Um, sir?  I know it's weird to see us here.
         But we found something cool.
         So like listen to this, it rocks!<p>

SGT. BUZZ:  Damnit, Beavis, we already know what that is!
            It's bad enough we've got losers like you in the world.
            We don't need this too!<p>

BUTTHEAD:  Listen asswipe, this stuff is cool.
           And if we play it the world won't suck so much<p>

SGT. BUZZ:  THAT DID IT! If you maggots don't get the hell outta this
            temple right now, I'm gonna take that strange device of
            yours and wrap it around your thick empty skulls!  Now get
            out!!!<p>

(final scene of Sgt Buzz chasing Beavis and Butthad out of the Temple)<p>

<strong>V. Oracle: The Trip<p></strong>

(scene opens with Beavis and Butthead licking toads, trying to get a
buzz.  Eventually they pass out, and Mr. Van Dresden, the sensitive new-age
English teacher appears as the oracle)<p>

BUTTHEAD: Who's this wuss?<p>

HIPPIE TEACHER:  Beavis and Butthead, I'm here to show you a strange
wondrous land, where the hand of mind shall arise with hungry mind and
open eyes...<p>

BUTTHEAD:  Huh-huh, you said "arise"<p>

BEAVIS: Are we gonna see chicks with big hooters?<p>

HIPPIE TEACHER: No, Beavis.  I'm here to take you to a land light
years away, where the people still learn and grow...<p>

(The oracle takes beavis and butthead to a planet known as "White
Zombie Sector F", A planet full of loud music made with the same
strange device that they found, free concerts, and legalized pot
After getting their fill, the oracle brings them back)<p>

HIPPIE TEACHER:  Now Beavis and Butthead, these people are coming home
some day.  And some day, this planet will be like theirs.<p>

BUTTHEAD: Whoa!  That would be cool!<p>

<strong>VI. Soliloquy<p></strong>

(Beavis and Butthead are back in their living room)<p>

BUTTHEAD: We've been waiting for days, but those cool aliens haven't
shown up yet.<p>

BEAVIS: Y'know, I used to think this planet sucked, but after seeing
that place that rocked, my life really sucks!<p>

(The music starts)<p>

BUTTHEAD: Uh, I'm still coming down from my trip
          Feeling dizzy and stuff,
          I take a no-doz and sit up
          But it's to early to get out of bed.
          I wish our world cool like that trip
          And, uh, like I wish it didn't suck.<p>

BEAVIS:(suddenly freaking out) JUST THINK OF WHAT MY LIFE MIGHT BE
                               IN A WORLD LIKE I HAVE SEEN!<p>

BUTTHEAD:(impressed) Whoa!<p>

BEAVIS: I DON'T THINK I CAN CARRY ON
        CARRY ON THIS COLD AND EMPTY LIFE
        OH NO....AAAAAAAH!!! AAAAAAAHH!!! AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<p>

BUTTHEAD: Settle DOWN, Beavis.<p>

BEAVIS: Um, oh yeah.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>

BUTTHEAD: So like, we're depressed and stuff...<p>

(Before they can do us a favor and end their worthless lives, we
hear...)<p>

<strong>VII. The Grand Finale<p></strong>

(A loud noise is heard outside.  Beavis and Butthead run out to see a
fleet of ships filling the sky, playing cool music.)<p>

BEAVIS: Check it out Butthead, they're here!<p>

BUTTHEAD: Yeah!  (Waving his arms) Hey!  Hey!  We're here!<p>

(One spaceship hovers over Beavis and Butthead.  For a second, there
is a strange hum, then a red laser strikes Beavis and Butthead,
reducing the pair to a pile of grey dust as a booming voice announces:<p>

ATTENTION ALL PLANETS OF THE SOLAR FEDERATION<p>

WE'RE GONNA KICK YOUR ASS<p>

                         THE END
<p>
