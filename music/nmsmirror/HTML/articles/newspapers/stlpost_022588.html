<font size=+1>No better time than a Rush hour</font><br>
<b>by David Surkamp</b><p>

"Of course, I felt deeply honored to be entered into Modern Drummer
magazine's Hall of Fame," said Neil Peart of the Canadian rock trio
Rush in a recent telephone interview. While Sunday mornings are not
exactly peak waking hours for a musician on a busy concert tour, the
percussionist was already well into his day. As he spoke, only the
slightest trace of irony in his voice betrayed the fact that his tongue was
planted firmly in cheek. "However, as I went down the list of previous
inductees, including Gene Krupa, Keith Moon and John Bonham, I
found it slightly disturbing to discover that almost everyone who had
received the award was already dead." <p>

One listen to Rush's current album "Hold Your Fire" brings home the
fact that Peart is in the pink and involved in some of the most
challenging music of the band's 19-year career. Emerging from its roots
as a classic power trio, Rush has evolved into the upper echelon of '80s
high-tech music wizardry. <p>

Rush will bring its "Hold Your Fire" tour to The Arena March 1. The
concert will also feature a performance by special guest Tommy Shaw,
former lead guitarist with the rock group Styx. <p>

With each successive release, Peart, bassist-vocalist Geddy Lee and
guitarist Alex Lifeson have expanded the boundaries of Rush's musical
vision. The three Toronto-based musicians have gracefully matured
from the heavy-metal excursions of their early days to the experimental
brilliance of the band's science-fiction opus "2112." <p>

When Rush released its self-titled debut album in 1974, the group made
significant impact on rock music with its crunching, riff-dominated
sound and Lee's high-pitched vocals. With the radio airwaves already
filled with the heavy rock sounds of acts such as Led Zeppelin and Deep
Purple, Rush's powerhouse style fit in perfectly with the times. <p>

However, with the success of progressive groups like Yes, King
Crimson and Genesis in the late '70s, one element of rock became
increasingly orchestrated and intricate. Unlike most acts, which develop
a stylistic personality and stick to it for the life of a career, Rush took
notice and began making radical changes in its sound. <p>

John Rutsey was the group's original drummer. Peart replaced him for
the second album, "Fly By Night." Although the songs still retained
the impact of the early material, the changes in style were already
making themselves evident. With Peart contributing the lyrics to the
music, the focus of the songs began taking on a more fantasy-oriented
direction. <p>

Then, as such space-rock acts as Pink Floyd and Hawkwind began
gaining popularity, Rush moved in that direction. It released its "2112"
and "Caress of Steel" albums and recorded its live show on "All the
World's a Stage." The albums were laced with Peart's other-worldly
images that would have fit nicely into the science-fiction novels of
Michael Moorcock or Larry Nivens. <p>

By the release of its 1980 album "Permanent Wave," Rush began
concentrating on shorter, more concise arrangements and thematically
unrelated songs. Although Peart's lyrics retained the flow and depth of
poetry, the songs were accepted on a more commercial level and the
band was rewarded with its first hit single "Spirit of the Radio." <p>

Throughout the '80s, the band has continued to cement its reputation as
one of Canada's biggest contributions to progressive rock. Albums
such as "Moving Pictures," "Signals" and "Power Windows,"
captured and held the public's attention, while the trio continued to be
one of world's highest-grossing arena attractions. <p>

"Shifts in the band's style have never been premeditated," Peart said.
"If anything, we have evolved entirely at our own pace. Fortunately,
music technology has improved as we have continued to expand Rush's
textural possibilities. Today, with the advent of sequencers and digital
sampling, one can easily recreate a recorded studio performance
onstage. <p>

"Even with the changes in our style," Peart continued, "we have never
considered adding another member to the group. We have always
worried about upsetting the delicate balance of personalities we have
established. It is no secret that if you can't get along as people, it makes
it difficult to expect any long-term commitment to the musical unit." <p>
