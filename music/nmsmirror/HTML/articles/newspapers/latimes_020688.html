<font size=+1>Rush Delivery: They Could Have Mailed It In</font><br>
<b>by Duncan Strauss</b><p>

Rush has always been a large target for critics and consumers who like their
rock to roll, and to have at least a little passion.
<p>
Opening a two-night stand Thursday at the Forum, the Canadian trio turned in a
set that showed why it attracts those salvos: The show was unquestionably
high-tech -- and high-technique -- but emotionally parched.
<p>
When singer-bassist Geddy Lee is concentrating on dispensing those thick, busy
bass lines, the band is on fairly firm, focused ground. But when he presided
over his array of synthesizers, Rush produced some high-falutin' orchestral
maneuvers -- symphonic rock that, especially on the longer pieces, involved
too many movements and too little <strong>movement</strong>.
<p>
Rush's music tends to be precisely constructed and, even live, precisely
executed. So you're more likely to <strong>admire</strong> the end product than be swept up
by it.
<p>
Maybe the threesome recognizes that the music itself is far from bracing,
which would explain why they checked in with this season's second-most
impressive and/or silliest visual presentation (after Pink Floyd).
<p>
Presumably to help underscore their lofty lyrics about such topics as time,
the future, nuclear energy and libertarianism, they trotted out all manner of
lasers, films and state-of-the-art lighting.
<p>
Things were so high-tech in fact, that when Rush performed "Time Stand Still"
-- the single that features 'til tuesday's singer Aimee Mann -- the absent
Mann's face appeared on the video screen, while her vocal contribution was
mixed into the song. The next best thing to being there?<p>
