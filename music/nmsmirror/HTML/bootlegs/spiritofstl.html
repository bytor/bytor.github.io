<strong>Sound Quality:</strong> 10-<br>
<strong>Packaging:</strong> 5<br>
<p>
Like La Villa, this cd sounds perfect, perhaps too perfect to some, as the
crowd noise is faded in and out at the appropriate moments. "Pops" from
the LP source can also be heard. But where else can you find these songs 
sounding this good?<p>

The original source is from a radio broadcast, then pressed to LP, then
finally made its way onto CD. All instruments are sharp and clear, and the
"pops" don't detract from the music. The reggae intro to "Working Man" is
worth the price of the disc alone!<p>

The cover of the cd is a picture of Geddy and Alex from the Presto tour, 
and the booklet was printed "backward" -- it folds out the wrong way. The 
inside also contains Presto pictures, as does the back. Surprisingly, all
the songs are labelled correctly on the packaging, and the medley is indexed
as one song (unlike La Villa). It also lists the date as February 14th.<P>

Overall, a must-have cd. I can't find any discernable difference between
this and La Villa, other than Spirit sounds like they had the recording
level upped a bit. Either is a fine choice.<p>
