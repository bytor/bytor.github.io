"I think it's important to tour," says Rush drummer Neil Peart. "Even when
touring's not a commercial necessity, it's still important musically.
Because, like anything else, if you stop doing it for awhile, you tend to
get complacent and your abilities atrophy. Traveling is important -- in terms 
of getting input and staying in touch with what's happening in the world."<p>

Compared to other bands, Rush has kept a low profile in the press,
because, said Peart, "We're more interested in the work than the
press in a general sense. I enjoy doing interviews because I like to
talk about what I'm doing, but we don't go out of our way to go to
every radio station in town, and we don't go out of our way to get
in print everywhere we can. I think that's a limiting factor -- we
won't inconvenience ourselves for the sake of getting some press. It
has to be done as a secondary priority.<p>

"The success is important to the band, but our main priority is to
do exactly what we want to."<p>

Rush triumph at New England's huge Worcester Centrum</font><br>

<em>Worcester, Mass.</em><p>

THE LADY MEANS BUSINESS.<p>

In the shopping-mall restaurant across the road from the Centrum, the stocky
teenage hostess stands blocking the aisle like a linebacker on the fifty
yard line.<p>

"The rest rooms are for customers only," she says in an I-take-my-job-seriously 
voice -- the proverbial 18 year old who's pushing 40.<p>

It's hard to say who looks more desperate: the guy in the denim jacket and
Rush T-shirt or his girlfriend. But we're talking major emergency here. Back
teeth are floating. Eyeballs are beginning to roll. The couple, slightly
doubled-over, appear to be in great pain. The hostess isn't budging.<p>

But she no sooner turns and marches off with a sadistic grin when the two
fans make their move. Like cat burglars, they tip-toe past her hand-in-hand,
shoot toward the back of the place, and duck unnoticed through the doorway
marked "Gents."<p>

They're in there for a few minutes, and when the door squeaks open and the
couple emerge, it's with an audible sigh of relief. Passing the preoccupied
hostess, they pause. And then, in a choreographed humanist gesture that
would make Neil Peart proud, they flash her a magnificent middle finger.
Standing by the exit, their right arms held aloft, they paint a perfect
portrait of Rush fans in triumph.<p>

At the Worcester Centrum, Rush pulled off a triumph themselves, proving that 
lingering rumors and the band's worst fears were groundless: rumors that the 
Canadian trio was fragmenting after years of almost non-stop touring; fears 
that their fans (as evidenced by the lukewarm reception given Signals two 
years ago) were beginning to drift.<p>

Backed by Laserium and rear-projected video clips (ranging from the suburban
montage of "Subdivisions" to SCTV's Count Floyd's howling introduction to
"The Weapon"), Rush proved there are still a surprising number of tricks and
turns to be squeezed out of what Geddy Lee once admitted is a "potentially
limiting" three-piece lineup.<p>

Not surprisingly, the show was heavily weighted in favor of Grace Under
Pressure. Although the unfamiliarity of the new stuff was sometimes met by a
subdued crowd reaction, the five months the band have spent on the road have
honed items like "The Body Electric," "Between the Wheels," and "The Enemy
Within" to a finer edge than the studio versions. Lee's streamlined
Steinberger bass and battery of keyboards cut through clear and strong, as
did Neil Peart's drums (particularly during a lengthy but imaginative drum
solo). And though Alex Lifeson's guitars fell victim to the Centrum's dodgy
acoustics, he seems to have pulled out of the creative nose-dive he made
during Signals.<p>

The Grace Under Pressure tour marks the first time the "Fear Trilogy" has
been wheeled out in its entirety -- thanks to what Peart calls "having a few
years behind us and better technology," which has allowed the previously
unperformable "Witch Hunt" to be played live. By the end of the night,
however, the most surprising aspect of the gig was the reaction to the
tracks culled from Signals.<p>

"We've noticed that ourselves," Neil Peart says, winding down backstage
after the gig as Lee and Lifeson sit glued to a televised baseball game
across the hall. "It's funny. On the tour on which Signals was first
presented, it received an uncertain reaction. But we'd also noticed that on
the last tour with "Vital Signs" from Moving Pictures. People didn't know
what to make of it, they were responsive and polite, but didn't really get
enthusiastic. It's only been on this tour that the song has come into its
own. Our audience has learned to rock to that kind of rhythm, but it took 
people a while to accept -- as it did me."<p>

The Centrum show was the work of a looser Rush, though Peart explains that
the show is still "largely arranged and organized, because we have a
standard we never want to fall below, a certain level of professionalism. If
you try to be spontaneous and innovative, that can sometimes be very
wonderful. We come into each hall in the afternoon and spend a period of
time being totally spontaneous. Some days it is excellent. It might even be
worth paying money for. Other days it's terrible. It's a way for us to
express ourselves for a while, and then get into the discipline of being
professionals.<p>

"There's a bad thing going on with some bands, however, that I find hard to
handle. We've had a lot of different bands open for us on this tour. But so
many don't even care about being good. I often sit by the side of the stage,
and it's great to see a good band before we play. It's inspiring and can
contribute to our performance. But sometimes...." Peart shrugs. "All they
care about is the clothes, the pose and the party. What goes through their
heads?"<p>

"With Rush," Peart says, "quality is the bottom line. On tour, we've reamed
how to pace ourselves better, how to distract ourselves, how to disperse the
pressure in a creative and graceful way. Caring about what I do has
motivated my life. Rush have always cared, and when we're making decisions,
we break it down to one fundamental thing: if we were a fan of Rush, what 
would we think?"<p>
