If you like old old Rush, you'll love this. Recorded in 1974, this cd has two
shows with songs no later than Fly By Night. It also contains two songs that
have never been officially released, "Bad Boy" (a cover song) and "Fancy
Dancer" (an original song).

This cd was actually taken from vinyl, as both these shows have been available
as lp boots for some time (one is called "Electric"). Because they were taken
from vinyl, some pops can be heard throughout the recording, but are not very
noticeable unless you're looking for them.<p>

The recording from Electric Ladyland is a soundboard -- it was actually
recorded "live in the studio" -- and the quality is 
similar to Rush's first album. Everything is clear, sharp and very RAW; you 
can barely hear the polite clapping of the audience. The worst thing about it
is that halfway through "By-Tor" the song is faded out! The recording from
Cleveland is probably a soundboard, but sounds distorted, as if the recording
level is set too high. The bass at times overwhelms the guitar. What's odd
about this is during some songs ("Working Man" in particular) there is a
peculiar stereo effect with Alex's guitar, as if he is magically moving from
left to right and back again across the stage in a few seconds.  The last two
tracks are much quieter than the rest, and not as distorted. The popping is
more noticeable during the Cleveland show than the NYC show.<p>

The packaging is simple, and a short essay by "Marathon Man" graces the back
of the booklet. Inside the company indulged themselves and listed other
bootlegs that they manufacture. On the back is a neat black & white photo of
the band from "the early days". "Fancy Dancer" is listed incorrectly as 
"Can't You See" and may fool quite a few.<p>

Overall a solid raw recording, one worth having especially if you're in to
early Rush. If you are a fan of later recordings, you'll probably want to pass
this by. Counterparts it is not!<p>
