They say it's only a game - not that I would change my mind<br>
On T.V. - ya see it's not a waste of time<br>
And if I win - i'll be rich, and it's no crime<br>
The way that big wheel spins<p>

Well I arrived in LA, Pat was there to shake my hand<br>
Thought I'd see, if I could be Vanna's man<br>
Taking no chances, I wait with rose in hand<br>
Her rejection was bad!<p>

BUYING A VOWEL<br>
Don't want to wait to solve it<br>
GET A FREE SPIN<br>
Or some insight that will help me win<br>
PLAYING WITH DORKS<br>
I can't believe they picked these contestants<br>
LOOK AT THAT CAR<br>
The way that big wheel spins<p>

Well I had only a few, them darn spaces to fill<br>
My mind goes blank, I think I'm getting ill<br>
So I thought I could solve it, but those chances are all in the wheel<p>

Well I still had a chance, spin without a second glance<br>
Going for broke, time for a final chance<br>
Way beyond hope, I wanna win that trip to France<br>
It's such a circumstance<p>

Wheel spins round, landing on a thousand bucks<br>
Keeping my assets, I'll have a better chance<br>
When the final guessing begins<p>

Wheel slows down, landing on the bankrupt spot<br>
Game redirected, wheel stops unexpected<br>
Sometimes the fat lady wins<br>
The way that damn wheel spins!<p>
