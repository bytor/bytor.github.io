This bootleg was one of the first I saw on LP. Here it's reproduced on cd and
apparently not directly from the LP -- there are no "pops" on this recording!
This is and excellent earlier show with a wonderful song selection.<p>

The sound quality is superb and obviously is a soundboard recording.
Everything is sharp and clear. The left channel does cut out slightly during
the beginning of "La Villa", but is recovered quickly. One added bonus is the
rendition of "The Sphere" between two songs, it's not listed on any of the
packaging and is indexed as part of "Closer to the Heart".  Another neat
surprise is Neil's drum solo during "In The Mood" -- again, not labelled and
entirely unexpected!<p>

However, there is a cut between "La Villa" and "2112", cutting off the first
couple of minutes of 2112. The song starts in the middle of 'Presentation'.
<p>

The packaging is pretty non-existent, the cover simulating a wooden crate with
a "rush" stamp on it. There are no pictures of the band, but at least the song
titles are all correct.<p>

This is a wonderful cd boot to have, if only to hear Alex jam at the beginning
of "La Villa"! You won't be disappointed in the sound quality!<p>
