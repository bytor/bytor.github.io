PERFORMANCE BY '70's BAND BRINGS A RUSH OF MEMORIES</font><br>
<strong>by Nick Carter</strong><p>

     Adolescents in the late '70's and early '80's fell into one of two
camps: those who would rip a band like Rush to pieces while combing back
their hair, adjusting their skinny ties, and listening to Elvis Costello in
the school lunch room.<P>
     Or, if you were a believer, you were among those who could be spotted at
the basement weekend beer bash, splayed out in a bean bag chair and musing
over the band's pseudo-spiritual lyrics while passing around a bong and
gazing at black light poster (of bands such as Rush).<P>
     A time advanced image of that latter bunch was present among the nearly
10,000 who attended Rush's show Saturday [sic] night at the Bradley Center.
Such is the loyalty inspired by Rush, now among a handful of older bands that
continue to draw big crowds without the benefit of a hit album or heavy video
exposure. Deadline prevented a review of the late part of the show.<P>
     There's something a bit funny about Rush.<P>
     At one level, the band practically epitomizes the corniness and
pretension of the worst '70's rock. But when judged by the overwrought tenets
of '70's and '80's progressive rock, Rush ranks fairly high as a band. Over
the years, the group has learned to take the concepts of teen angst and
introspection and spew them into inanely introspective lyrical themes and
engaging, if overwrought, power rock arrangements. The band accomplishes its
artistic task, but it's just that the forum and direction of its talents,
especially with Rush consisting entirely of men in their 40s, seems
hopelessly sophomoric and lacking in humor.<P>
     The early Rush tune "2112" (its 20-minute-plus 1976 opus; sort of a
"Stairway to Heaven" for the stoner crowd) is more a string of musical
vignettes than a single composition. The various bits jump from basic hard
rock anthems to esoteric art-rock melodies, aided by drummer Neil Peart's
hyper-polyrhythmic dexterity and lead singer and bassist Geddy Lee's
accomplished bass lines.<P>
     Among other vintage material came the AOR classics "Tom Sawyer" and "The
Trees," which seemed to please the crowd the most. Among the brightest of the
flashbacks was "Closer to the Heart," which had Lee actually wailing an
octave above his usual trademark falsetto. Newer material from the recent
album "Test for Echo" and songs such as "Driven" and "Virtuosity" [sic] seem
to take a more direct power rock course, relying less on synthesizers and
complex arrangements.<p>
