There's a space between white and wheat<br>
not too many think about<br>
On the shelves between red jam and 'kraut<br>
The space between Wonder and trout<p>

This is some fresh bread<br>
Baked just like I said<br>
Those crusty loaves just won't satisfy<br>
Taste buds are keen, and so is my tie (?)<p>

yuum loaf to loaf to yum yum to loaf<br>
why the bread why the bread?<p>

There is a fine loaf, in the bakery section<br>
A sign placed to predicate<br>
the price between day-old and soft<br>
the fence between bagels and lox<p>

This is some fresh bread<br>
I postulate<br>
These homespun loaves; pumpernickel and rye<br>
The sign it says they are a key buy<p>

yuum loaf to loaf to yum yum to loaf<br>
why the bread why the bread?<p>

Some need to eat bread in the sun at high noon<br>
Some need to chew in the dark of the moon<br>
Eat cornbread fist-sized, stuffing it in your face<br>
We just need butter<br>
by the pound or the case<p>

This is a fine loaf, off the shelf I will take<br>
These baked just right; they look good to my eye<br>
The space between Wonder and rye<p>

yuum loaf to loaf to yum yum to loaf<br>
why the bread why the bread?<p>
