<font size=+1>For Rush, 'Roll the Bones' has big crowd rockin' and 
rollin' all night</font><br>
Rush, at the Seattle Center Coliseum, with Primus, last night.<br>
<b>by Tom Phalen</b><p>

Rush brought in as big a crowd as the Coliseum has seen in quite a while.
Just shy of capacity, it was a house that roared louder than the thundering
trio itself, which was a considerable accomplishment.  <p>

True, there were people there to see the opening Primus -- and some
actually made it through the slow, snaking line outside to catch, say, half
of Primus' set. But it was an audience expecting and receiving not only a
lion's share of the Rush's new "Roll the Bones" release, but a healthy
retrospective of Rush's greatest hits, videos and laser effects as well.  <p>

The band opened with four fast hits, including the rallying cry, "Free
Will." It was literally and figuratively supported by an enormous stage, an
elaborate lighting system and rear screen projection of various Rush videos
and cartoons. It was an impressive opening.  <p>

Geddy Lee, whose backbone bass and high register vocals were as solid and
true as ever, finally spoke at the end of the opening quartet. Thanking the
crowd, he led the band into the new release with the opening "Dreamland."
It's one of the best cuts from "Bones." Youth on the run across a landscape
of Hollywood fantasies, a cinematic theme that reemerges throughout the
band's considerable library. "Dreamland" segued into "Bravado," not as
strong a piece but well made up for by the visuals.  <p>

The members of Rush are not nearly as dynamic performers as they are
musicians. They're friendly, even accessible, considering the broad scope
of the production and occasional overreach of their lyrics. So the
inclusion of the addition videos is a plus rather than a distraction. Much
of "Roll the Bones" cover art imagery was recreated. Most impressive was
the title tune itself, a continuously active background of computer
animated dice, bones, skull hats, rabbits and guitars. A yammering skeleton
that jawboned the rap middle of the song was probably the most impressive
aspect. But cartoons used for "The Big Money" and "Tom Sawyer" were equally
entertaining.  <p>

Of course, Rush have always been at the vanguard of the Laserium concept,
and this show was no exception. Rays, fans, alien motherships and every
other lighting effect imaginable played across the stage and stadium. It
still sells.  <p>

But the biggest visual surprise was the 30-foot inflatable rabbits that
popped out of top hats on either side of the stage, bobbing, and weaving to
the closing numbers.  <p>

The biggest musical surprise was the sweeping instrumental, "Where's My
Thing? (Part IV, "Gangster of Boats" Trilogy)." Judging form the
overwhelming response the audience accorded the driving and dramatic
anthem, Rush could probably soft peddle some of those words and pictures.
No one would mind.
