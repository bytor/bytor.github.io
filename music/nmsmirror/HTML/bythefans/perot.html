<font size=+3>H. Ross Perot</font><br>
by Jared Strasburg<br>
<em>November 16, 1993</em>
<p>

I knew he was different in his political philosophy.<br>
All of his speeches seem to lack lucidity.<br>
He never seemed a threat to this great democracy.<br>
I only got some chuckles from his paranoid mentality.<p>

As the years went by, we remained apart.<br>
When I heard that Bush sabotaged his daughter's wedding,<br>
I felt a shadow cross my heart.<br>
But he's -<p>

H. Ross Perot - Makes a billion dollars, so he can do as he pleases.<br>
Perot - Makes another billion, invents conspiracies.<br>
Perot - Not the polished speaker, and in the polls it showed.<br>
Perot - In the last election, he played the spoiler's role.<br>
H. Ross Perot<p>

I didn't like Perot, but I watched him on TV.<br>
His dignity was shattered in a nightmare of stupidity.<br>
He called the Vice Prez a liar and NAFTA an atrocity.<br>
He said our jobs would all go south and offered pie charts as testimony.<p>

As the evening went by, his case fell apart.<br>
When I heard the debate was over, I felt a shadow cross my heart.<br>
But he's -<p>

H. Ross Perot - Has lots of clever insults, talks with a Texas twang.<br>
Perot - Everybody's out to get him, but he doesn't give a dang.<br>
Perot - Everybody's out to get him, but he doesn't give a dang.<br>
Perot - Not a politician, but they still fear his name.<br>
Perot - Not the glamour boy - does this man have no shame?<br>
H. Ross Perot<p>

As the years went by, we remained apart.<br>
When I heard that he was running in '96, I felt a shadow cross my heart.<br>
