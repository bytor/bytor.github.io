<font size=+1>Excitement the byword for rock band Rush</font><br>
<br>

One definition of the word "rush" is the initial quick, euphoric reaction
produced by a drug.<p>

Rush is also the name of a rock band, known for its fast, stimulating and
electric sounds.<p>

Neil Peart, drummer and chief lyricist for the Canadian group, said in a
recent telephone interview that "excitement" is their byword.<p>

"When it comes to writing a song, or trying a new idea, all of us have to be
excited about it or it won't happen," he said. "We have one of the few working
democracies around. Every decision we make is subject to unanimity. We deal in
consensus, not majority rule.<p>

"There has to be enough excitement in our music to make it fresh for us even
after days and weeks of rehearsing. It is conceivable that one composition may
be playing 300 or 400 times. If the music is exciting and alive to begin with,
there is a better chance that it will still be alive for us and our audience
after the 300th or 400th playing."<p>

Rush, which will play the Memorial Coliseum at 8 p.m. Thursday, March 20, has
been around for about eight years. Peart did not join the group until six
years ago when bass-player Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson needed a new
drummer. The band's original percussionist had left as a result of
disagreements, according to Peart.<P>

Peart described Rush's music as very simple in the earlier days, as compared
to the group's style now. At that time the instrumentation consisted only of
bass, guitar and drums. Now the band makes heavy use of electronic
synthesizers to produce a much more powerful, complex sound.<p>

One other factor contributing to the increased complexity of Rush's music has
been the heightened skill of the group's musicians. Peart said, "A lot of
credit is due to other musicians, whom we've admired. As you progress, the
standard within your grasp becomes higher and higher. Different influences,
and often better influences, are constantly breaking into, and improving, your
own eclecticism."<p>

When the drummer first joined the group, bass-man Geddy lee was writing most
of the lyrics. Peart's assignment as lyricist came about "as much by default
as anything." Although he had only dabbled with words for his own relaxation
and enjoyment before joining Rush, Peart now considers his writing serious
work. His interest, he says, has been sufficiently sparked to tackle short
stories and novels someday.<p>

Peart's lyrics are more involved than a string of simple refrains strung
together. Read apart from the music they are poems imbued wit ha sense of
mysticism -- themes that probe beyond the simple concrete existence of man's
life on earth, which this excerpt from "Free Will" demonstrates:
<dl>
<dd>
There are those who think that life<br>
Has nothing left to chance<br>
With a host of holy horrors<br>
To direct our aimless dance<p>

A planet of playthings<br>
We dance on the strings<br>
Of powers we cannot perceive<p>

The stars aren't aligned<br>
Or the gods are malign<br>
Blame is better to give than receive<p>
</dd></dl>

Rush's audience is young -- mostly in the 18- to 25-year-old range. With that
age group and the high excitement level of the music, one would anticipate
festival seating at the Coliseum on March 20.<p>

But such will not be the case as the group has put a moratorium on festival
seating (in performance halls that will allow them the choice), since 11 young
people were trampled to death Dec. 3 outside a concert scheduled by The Who,
in Cincinnati.<p>

"I have wanted to get rid of festival seating for several years now," said
Peart, "but before the Cincinnati incident, no one would take that request
seriously.<p>

"Our audiences (like The Who's) have the tendency to get very fired up. I like
an enthusiastic audience, but I do not like to watch people in physical pain.
Occasionally fans would charge en masse to get to our stage during a
performance. I saw people pressed against the stage, or picked up and dragged
by their feet.<p>

"The problems with festival seating and the high excitement level of rock
concerts were brought home for everyone in Cincinnati."<p>

Dick Reynolds, general manager of Memorial Coliseum, echoed Peart's concerns
but said it is not the policy of the coliseum to require either reserve or
festival seating. "Such a decision is up to the act," he said.<p>

Reynolds said that, to date, he has only received two requests for reserve
seating from bands who normally ask for festival seating: one from Rush, the
other from The Who.<p>
