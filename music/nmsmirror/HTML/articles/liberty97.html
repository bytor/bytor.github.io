<b>Liberty</b> -- September 1997</font><br><br>
<font size=+1>A Rebel and a Drummer</font><br>
<b>by Scott Bullock</b><p>

<em>
Rush's outspoken individualist drummer talks to Liberty's 
interviewer about Ayn Rand, his left-wing critics, 
and the pleasures of not selling out.</em><p>

Mention that you like Rush to a libertarian or conservative between the ages
of 25 and 40, and you might be surprised at the response. Rather than
immediately assume you are talking about a tubby right-wing radio
commentator, the person will likely think you mean a hard rock power trio
from Canada whose songs have vigorously defended individualism and
technology for over 20 years.<p>

        With no Top-40 or MTV exposure, Rush -- guitarist Alex Lifeson, bass
player and vocalist Geddy Lee, and drummer Neil Peart -- has nevertheless
built up an enormous fan base. Its last 16 albums have gone gold or
platinum, and the group is one of the most successful and enduring live
acts. Rush has a strong allegiance amoung young people tired of the nearly
monolithic leftward slant of rock groups. Even a cursory listen to Rush will
explain its attraction. As Bill Banasiewicz said in Visions, his biography
of Rush, the main interest in the group throughout its career, in addition
to making great music, has been in promoting human freedom.<p>

        The band released its first album in 1974, chock-full of Led
Zeppelin-like guitar riffing, vocal wailing, and pedestrian lyrics. Things
got much better by the second album with the addition of drummer Neil Peart.
Not only did Peart bring an exciting rhythmic influence to the band, he also
became the groups lyricist.<p>

        Peart's lyrics were a surprising change of pace, and unique in the
annals of rock. At the time most rock lyrics fit into one of three
categories: collectivist, left-wing political songs, maudlin
singer-songwriter fare, or macabre heavymetal posing. While some of Peart's
musings resembled the science fiction-fueled sagas popularized by Yes,
Genesis, and other progressive rock groups, Peart's main inspiration was
novelist and philosppher Ayn Rand. Indeed, Rush's epic 1976 album, <b>2112</b>, was
inspired by Rand's novel Anthem, a dystopian tale of one man's struggle to
revive individualism in a world so collectivist that even the word "I" is
prohibited. In the liner notes to the album, Peart sets forth his
appreciation for "the genius of Ayn Rand." Peart actually signalled his
interest in Rand in 1975's Fly by Night. In that album's "Anthem", Peart writes:
<p><dl><dd><tt>

        I know they always told you<br>
        Selfishness was wrong<br>
        But is was for me, not you<br>
        I came to write this song.</tt>

</dd></dl><p>

        Rand's influence and philosophy is evident in numerous other Rush
songs, including many that have become FM rock staples. Peart's lyrics for
"Free Will" neatly sums up the victim mentality of many alternative rock
bands (and fans):<p>
<dl><dd><tt>

        There are those who think that<br>
        They've been dealt a losing hand...<br>
        All pre-ordained<br>
        A prisoner in chains<br>
        A victim of venomous fate.
</tt>
</dd></dl><P>

        Here Peart could have been writing about Billy Corgan of Smashing
Pumpkins, who screams "Despite all my rage/I am still just a rat in a cage."
But the Rush song rejects this sense of helplessness, insisting that<p>
<dl><dd>
<tt>

        You can choose a ready guide<br>
        In some celestial voice<br>
        If you choose not to decide<br>
        You still have made a choice<br>
        You can choose from phantom fears<br>
        And kindness that can kill<br>
        I will choose a path that's clear<br>
        I will choose free will.<br>
              <em>(from <b>Permanent Waves</b> [1980])</em>
</tt>
</dd></dl><p>

        In the early 1980s (and even today on album-orientated rock
stations), it was hard to escape Rush's best known song, "Tom Sawyer," from
1981's <b>Moving Pictures</b> album. Transforming Twain's young individualist into
a "modern-day warrior," the song celebrates maintaining one's independence
and inquisitive spirit in an increasingly collectivist world. The song
contains perhaps the most Randian nugget in all Rush songs: "His mind is not
for rent/To any god or government."<p>

        Rush's response to their increasing fame was the majestic
"Limelight," also from <b>Moving Pictures</b>. Rather than whine about how rough it
is being a rock star, the song takes a clear-headed approach to dealing with
the pressures and temptations of stardom. While admitting that "living on a
lighted stage approaches the unreal," one must nevertheless put aside
alienation and all of the other bogus complaints of rock stars, and "get on
with the fascination" of making music. (If only Kurt Cobain had listened.)
Driving home the point, the song features a blazing guitar riff and an
electrifying solo by Alex Lifeson.<p>

        All these songs represent the band's most successful period, 1980 to
1984, when they transformed their style from sometimes meandering
progressive rock suites to catchier, more tightly crafted songs. Nowhere is
this new approach more evident than in the first song from <b>Permanent Waves</b>,
"The Spirit of Radio," which was also literally the first song released in
the 1980s, on January 1, 1980. Hearing it in the car, amidst late '70s disco 
dreck, was a welcome shock, and instantly made fans of many who had overlooked 
the less radio-friendly Rush songs of the '70s. The song has an insistent, 
muscular sound that fairly leaps from a car stereo and is itself a paean to 
radio, and to the sheer exhileration of driving a car with a great song coming 
over the airwaves.<p>

        The song represents another consistent theme of Rush -- an
appreciation and defense of science and technology. While many rock songs
bemoan progress and technological advancement, Rush uniquely embraces
science, space exploration (most noticably in "Countdown," from <b>Signals</b>),
and, on the band's latest album (albeit with some reservations), the
Internet and global communication.<p>

        "The Spirit of Radio" also represents, however, a certain
ambivalence in Peart's philosophy. Although his lyrics almost always affirm
individualism, several reveal a degree of suspicion about a fundamental
tenet of Rand's philosophy of "Objectivism" -- its belief in the morality of
commerce. "The Spirit of Radio" glorifies the technology of radio, but it
also rails against the corruption of this bright medium by, of all people,
"salesmen!" (sung in one of Geddy Lee's patented shrieks). In "Natural
Science," from the same album, Peart states his belief that ultimately "art
as expression/not as market campaigns/will still capture our imaginations."<p>

        Peart, a thoughtful, self-educated man, was introduced to
Objectivism by reading The Fountainhead while a teenager. When he was 18,
Peart moved from Canada to England to pursue a music career; but unlike most
of his peers, he never viewed music as a "mercenary endeavor." Music, to
Peart, is pure expression, and to play only for a paycheck is "prostitution"
and "pretty evil." He worked a day job to support himself, and played only
music he loved. It's little wonder that he was so entranced by The
Fountainhead. As Peart commented in an interview with me, speaking from his
home in Toronto, Howard Roark, the book's hero, affirms the principles of
integrity, individualism, and self-reliance by which Peart was already
seeking to fashion his own life.<p>

<blockquote>
<b>
        Howard Roark stood as a role model for me -- as exactly the 
        way I already was living. Even at that tender age [18] I 
        already felt that. And it was intuitive or instinctive or inbred
        stubbornness or whatever; but I had already made those
        choices and suffered for them.</b>
</blockquote><p>

        Shortly after Peart joined Rush, the group faced a crisis. Rush's
first three records had sold fairly well, but the record company wanted more
and pressured the group to change its style. Consultants were brought in,
and Rush was on the verge of "selling out" to make its music more
marketable. After much debate and tension with the band, and between the
record company and Rush's management, the group members decided to stick to
their artistic visions and reject the advice of their would-be handlers. The
result was <b>2112</b>, a very successful album that both increased Rush's
reputation and record sales, and vindicated Peart's artistic vision. So it
isn't surprising that Peart expresses some hostility toward salesmen,
marketers, or anyone else who would undermine artistic integrity.<p>

        The dilemma faced by Rush in the mid-1970s reflects a certain
tension in Rand's philosophy -- between her insistence on integrity and
individualism on the one hand, and the demands of the marketplace on the
other. After all, businesses are in a certain sense slaves to the
preferences and desires of others (a fact often overlooked by those on the
left). If the comsumer does not like its products, a business fails, no
matter how principled the capitalist or excellent his offerings.<p>

        Of course, Rand never claimed that making money (or selling records)
should be the ultimate aim of an entrepreneur (although certainly he is
entitled to the money he makes). Rather, a businessperson, artist,
scientist, or musician should realize his own dreams and ambitions by
adhering to the highest standard possible. Hopefully, others will appreciate
quality and be willing to pay for it. If not, then the individual still
keeps his integrity. And Peart doesn't attack capitalism so much as he
criticizes anyone, inside or outside the business world, who would try to
stop an individual from achieving his vision.<p>

        "Subdivisions" (1982) also seems to attack one of the crowning
achievements of modern capitalism, the suburbs. Long a target of leftist
culture critics, suburbs are generally defended by free marketeers as a
place where the working class can gain a modicum of comfort and independece
unknown in pre-capitalist or socialist societies. Peart, however, sees the
'burbs quite differently:<p>
<dl><dd><tt>
        Sprawling on the fringes of the city<br>
            In geometric order<br>
        An insulated border<br>
        In between the bright lights<br>
        And the far unlight unknown<p>

        Growing up it all seems so one-sided<br>
        Opinions all provided<br>
        The future pre-decided<br>
        Detatched and subdivided<br>
        In the mass production zone.<p>

        Nowhere is the dreamer<br>
        Or the misfit so alone.<p>

        Subdivisions --<br>
        In the highschool halls<br>
        In the shopping malls<br>
        Conform or be cast out...<p>

        Any escape might help to smooth<br>
        The unattractive truth<br>
        But the suburbs have no charms to soothe<br>
        The restless dreams of youth.<br>
             <em>(from <b>Signals</b>)</em>

</tt></dd></dl><p>
        To Peart, the suburbs can crush individuality. But is this a
repudiation of Objectivism? Most Objectivists and libertarians, and even
some conservatists, share Peart's thoughtful skepticism toward mass culture.
We may defend suburbs, strip malls, and a Boston Market on every block, but
we truly glorify the upstart entrepreneur, the non-conforming artist, and
others who challenge conventional wisdom and powerful institutions (many of
which are dominated today by the left).<p>

        Furthermore, though he loathes the suburbs, Peart writes tributes to
cities:<p>
<dl><dd><tt>

        The buildings are lost<br>
        In their limitless rise<br>
        My feet catch the pulse and the purposeful stride<br>
        I feel the sense of possibilities<br>
        I feel the wrench of hard realities<br>
        The focus is sharp in the city.<br>
             <em>("The Camera Eye" from <b>Moving Pictures</b> [1981])</em>
</tt></dd></dl><p>

        Rand would probably not have objected to Peart's contrast between
subdivisions and cities. She lived in and glorified Manhattan, not
Westchester County.<p>

        For long-time observers of Rush, it is clear that Peart has drifted
from his more obvious attachments to Objectivism. The more overtly Randian
references in Peart's lyrics have dwindled. <b>Power Windows</b> (1985) even
contains a song called "Mystic Rhythms," in which Peart takes an almost
worshipful, animistic view of nature. On Rush's latest album, he seems to
attack the West for supposedly causing Third World poverty:<p>
<dl><dd><tt>

        Half the world cares<br>
        While half the world is wasting the day<br>
        Half the world shares<br>
        While half the world is stealing away.<br>
            <em>("Half the World," from <b>Test for Echo</b> [1996])</em>
</tt></dd></dl><p>

        But Peart says that he has few problems with Rand's philosophy,
citing only two specific areas of disagreement. Contrary to Rand's rejection
of any form of government welfare, Peart supports a safety net for those in
need. Although he would prefer that welfare be funded voluntarily, he is not
convinced that private charity alone could support the truly needy. Also,
Peart was turned off by Rand's attacks on hippies and Woodstock:<p>

<blockquote><b>
        I always loved machines, and I always loved the workings
        of mankind in making things. I stayed up all night to watch
        the Apollo moon landing, and at the same time I was just as 
        excited by Woodstock. There is in fact no division there. In
        both cases you're talking about the things that people make
        and do. So I didn't see any division, but of course Rand did,
        in seeing us all as the unwashed Bohemian hordes.
</b></blockquote><p>

        Although Peart is now inclined to write off Rand's hostility toward
the Woodstock kids as a "generational thing," it was her essay on Woodstock
and rock music which forced him to realize that he did not agree with Rand
on every issue.<p>
<blockquote><b>

        That was when I started to not become a Randroid, and
        started to part from being a true believer. I realized that
        there were certain elements of her thinking and work that
        were affirming for me, and others that weren't. That's an
        important thing for any young idealist to discover -- that
        you are still your own person.
</b></blockquote><p>

        Over the years, Peart has made fewer direct references to Rand, and
he admits that one cause of the decline has been the intense hostility such 
sentiments have evoked among rock critics, especially in Britian:<p>
<blockquote><b>

        There was a remarkable backlash, especially from the
        English press -- this being the late seventies, when collectivism 
        was still in style, especially among journalists. They
        were calling us "junior fascists" and "Hitler lovers." It was a
        total shock to me.
</b></blockquote><p>

        Flip through any Rush review from the '70s and early '80s, and
you're likely to find a reference to the supposedly fascist overtones in
Rush lyrics -- invariably in reaction to Peart's admiration for Rand. Peart
says he was "shocked, stunned, and wounded" that people could equate
adherence to individualism, self-reliance, and liberty with fascism or
dictatorship. This savage reaction awakened Peart to a "polarity" between
Rand's philosophy and that of critics.<p>

<blockquote><b>
        For me, religion is life, and nothing else is worth living or
        dying for -- or killing other people for. But a large part of
        the world is convinced otherwise, so you tend to just allude
        to it in writing, but shut up about it when you're in an intolerant 
        group. You know, the Salman Rushdie lesson.
</b></blockquote><p>

        Convinced that he should stop sending up "flares" by directly
referencing Rand, Peart worked to incorporate her ideas in a more subtle
manner. The Randian elements in such songs as "Tom Sawyer," "Free Will," and
the more recent "Mission," (from 1987's Hold Your Fire) are far more
effective than the heavy-handed style of "Anthem" and 2112. This movement
away from hard-core Randianism paralleled Peart's rejection of involvement
in the organized movement:<p>

<blockquote><b>
        In the late seventies I subscribed to the Objectivist Forum for
        awhile. And it could be such a beautiful thing, it could be
        like a breath of fresh air coming in the mailbox. But it 
        became petty and divisive and also factionalized....I tend
        to stay away from it [now]. It's in the nature of the individualist 
        ethos that you don't want to be co-opted.<p>
          [Also], the ones most devoted to the cause are the ones
        with least of a life. A friend of mine who was involved in
        the Ayn Rand estate and the initial institutes and so on
        noticed that all of the coteries surrounding her didn't do anything....<p>
         The whole philosophy is about doing things...
        with an eye towards excellence and beauty. And that was the 
        one thing that was lacking in any of the coteries surrounding
        her. So that's another reason people stay away from [the official 
        Objectivist movement], saying, "Well, I have a life and
        I'm living the philosophy -- so why do I want to stop and
        talk about it with other people who aren't doing it?"
</b></blockquote><p>

        Peart acknowledges that other thinkers besides Rand have influenced
his philosophy. Jungian psychology, for instance, provides themes for a
number of songs, and Peart also cites John Dos Passos as an influence on his
thinking. Still, the Objectivist influences persist. Encapsulating the
Objective cultural critique, Peart remarks that in too much of popular
culture today, only the "poor and dumb" are glorified, never the "rich and
smart." And his "Heresy" (1991) is perhaps the only "fall of communism" song
that recognizes the essential link between personal and economic freedom:<p>
<dl><dd><tt>

        All around that dull gray world<br>
        From Moscow to Berlin<br>
        People storm the barricades<br>
        Walls go tumbling in<br>
        The counter revolution<br>
        At the counter of a store<br>
        People smiling through their tears.<br>
             <em>(from <b>Roll the Bones</b>)</em>
</tt></dd></dl><p>

        Politically, Peart describes himself as a "left-wing libertarian,"
noting that he could never be a conservative due to the right's intolerance
and support of censorship. Moreover, the rise of religious fundamentalism in
America and throughout the globe "terrifies" him. But he also sees rising
intolerance coming from the left, exemplified by a Toronto law "forbidding
smoking in any bar, restaurant, coffee shop, doughnut shop, anywhere." Thus,
though he believes that economic freedom is generally increasing, Peart also
observes that "socially it seems to be the opposite -- there is actually more
oppression."<p>

        Apart from the unique lyrics and world view, another aspect of Rush
that makes the group so appealing, especially to hard-core music
aficionados, is that all three members are virtuoso musicians. Each one of
their albums demonstrates a refinement of their musical skills. The members
take music seriously and constantly explore new musical ideas. Neil Peart is
one of the most admired percussionists in any genre of music, a sort of
drumming ubermensch whose extraordinary technique dazzles and delights
musicians and non-musicians alike.<p>

        Last year, Rush released its 20th album, <b>Test for Echo</b>, and will
tour again this summer to sold-out venues. Whether the band will break up
after this tour is discussed passionately among fans over the Internet.
Whatever the future of Rush, libertarians and Objectivists can delight in a
band whose music they can enjoy without having to ignore or cringe at the
lyrics. Some of Peart's lyrics can be strident or contradictory, but most
are eloquent and desperately needed defenses of individualism in a
collective age:<p>
<dl><dd><tt>

        I'm not giving in<br>
        To security under pressure<br>
        I'm not missing out<br>
        On the promise of adventure<br>
        I'm not giving up<br>
        On implausible dreams --<br>
