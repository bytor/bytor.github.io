Change the tire --<br>
Screw the lugs on tight<br>
Hurry now<br>
  <dd>don't take all damn night --<br></dd>
An auto with emissions<br>
  <dd>is a car with bad pistons<p></dd>

I hear their noisy garages<br>
Pay the bills<br>
  <dd>that break my bank<br></dd>
I gaze at the grimey mechanic<br>
The patch on his shirt says he's "Hank"<p>

When I feel the power decreasing<br>
And my car won't climb the hills<br>
I wish I owned their business --<br>
I wouldn't pay these bills!<p>

Autos spew forth noxious emissions<br>
Wrench-turners are waiting<br>
Focused only on their high profits<br>
So I can pay for their dating<p>

Get a grip on<br>
  <dd>this costly possession --<br></dd>
I'm a slave to my driving obsession --<br>
My car spews emissions,<br>
  <dd>and they say it's the pistons...<p></dd>

I watch the red gauges flicker<br>
Bring the car to a grinding halt<br>
Walk six miles<br>
  <dd>to the gas station<br></dd>
And I know it's all Hank's fault<p>

But he can't even<br>
  <dd>change motor oil<br></dd>
Nor gap the spark plugs right<br>
Mechanics just want more money --<br>
To free me from my plight!<p>

It's a long walk home<br>
You'd better not doubt it<br>
Should've asked for a loaner --<br>
Now I suffer without it<p>

If your car is<br>
  <dd>exotic and strange<br></dd>
You'd be wise to<br>
  <dd>quickly exchange it<br></dd>
For something with parts priced more sane<br>
Maybe something in Yugo's price range<p>

We each pay an outrageous price<br>
For our autos that look so nice<br>
But those cars with worn pistons<br>
  <dd>make some wonderful cisterns...<p></dd>
