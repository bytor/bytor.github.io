<font size=+1>There's a need for this kind of music</font><br>

<em>
Geddy Lee of the legendary Toronto power trio Rush -- which has just 
launched a fourth live album -- says he's sure progressive rock will always 
be with us.</em><p>

Toronto -- "The normal way of doing a live album is not an ideal situation 
for a band," asserts Geddy Lee, long-time vocalist and bassist for the rock 
band Rush, and a man who should know.<p>

"You take a recording truck, and barge in on six or seven dates. You create 
tension, you distract the performers, and you cause a totally unnatural 
environment. You basically throw everything into a tizzy, and at the end 
of it all, you really haven't even captured the band in its normal state," 
he said.<p>

"So I often wondered, what would happen if you just went out and recorded 
every single night of the tour, and at the end just picked through the tapes 
to find those really amazing performances that are relaxed and confident, 
where the crowd is super, and when it's just one of those magic nights?"<p>

With that in mind, Lee reviewed virtually every note played on last year's 
Test For Echo tour. The results of this exhaustive process can be heard on 
the band's latest album, <b>Different Stages</b>, which went on sale last week. The 
fourth live-album release from the veteran Toronto power trio, <b>Different 
Stages</b> is more than three hours long -- a sprawling document that must surely 
stand as one of the most expertly recorded and produced live rock albums 
ever released.<p>

And while the name on the cover confirms that this is indeed a group project, 
it was mostly Lee himself who bore the brunt of the responsibility for its 
creation. "Well," the 45-year old musician said with a shrug, over what 
looked like a cup of herbal tea in the basement of his Cabbagetown 
record-company office, "live albums are a difficult and time-consuming 
project. They're not joyous, like making a new album, because you're not 
creating anything from scratch. . . . So the other guys [drummer Neil Peart 
and guitarist Alex Lifeson] were like, 'You wanna do this? Fine! See you 
later.' So they kinda bailed out on the whole thing. But that's fine. I 
guess I've got more of a focus on stuff like this."<p>

Speaking of Neil Peart, the one question that most begged to be asked during 
the interview is the one that Lee was most unable to answer: The fact that 
Peart lost both his daughter and his wife through separate tragedies recently 
has thrown the future of the band into doubt.<p>

"It's too soon to say," what that future will be, Lee said. "It's not 
something that's even been broached. All that's important is that Neil have 
the time to heal."<p>

For a group that has such a long-time reputation as a quintessential touring 
band, the release over the years of four full albums of live work is both 
justified and appreciated by Rush's worldwide legion of fans, who 
traditionally turn such albums into gold and platinum releases. (The live 
albums that preceded <b>Different Stages</b> are: <b>All The World's a 
Stage</b> in
1976, <b>Exit... Stage Left</b> in 1981, and <b>A Show of Hands</b> in 1988.)<p>

But what's even more interesting is the observation made by some critics and 
fans who have noticed that the band's live albums always seem to come after 
a trio of studio albums has been released, and that the inevitable live album 
marks the end of one phase of the band's career and the subsequent beginning 
of another.<p>

"Well, people do keep pointing that out to me," Lee said with a laugh. "But I 
don't know that it's a conscious thing. You don't ever know when you're 
at the beginning of a new phase, only when you just finished it and are 
looking back."<p>

As well as hearing highlights of the Test For Echo tour on <b>Different 
Stages</b>, 
Rush fans will be receiving an added bonus as well. A third disc, a long-lost 
document of a performance staged at London's Hammersmith Odeon in 1978, will 
be packaged alongside the others. Included at no extra cost to the consumer 
(Lee happily notes that the three-disc package will ultimately cost only a 
tad more than a single disc would) the London show serves as an interesting 
counterpoint to the more refined and mature sound that the band would develop 
over the following two decades.<p>

The new album as a whole comes as a reminder that not only have the members 
of this Toronto trio amassed a remarkably consistent track record, but that 
they have done so by performing a type of music -- progressive rock -- that, 
while having its champions, has also had more than its share of detractors. 
Somehow, Rush has managed to confound the critics and naysayers and maintain 
its tremendous international following by performing a brand of music that 
hasn't been widely popular in two decades, except when they do it.<p>

"I think there are fans of this kind of music that really pay no mind to the 
trends," Lee suggested. "There's something in this kind of music that talks 
to them, is very important to them, and yet exists outside the ebb and flow 
of the ever-changing pop scene. I've always had the feeling that [progressive 
rock] would become less popular, then more popular, and so on.  But it will 
always be around because of the connection that I see made with certain 
members of our audience. There's a need for this kind of music, and I always 
figured that we'd hang around to fill it."<p>
