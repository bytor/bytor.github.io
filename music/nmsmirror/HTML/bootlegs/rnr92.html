This is arguably the best double-cd bootleg out there. Taken from a soundboard
recording of an early Roll the Bones concert, it sounds almost like an
official live Rush album. It merely lacks the final mix of elements to make a
"true" live album (sometimes the crowd is too loud, sometimes very faint).<p>

The original recording of this show is somewhat in question. Story has
it that Les Claypool (bassist for the group Primus, an opening act on the RTB
tour) wanted to hear a recording of one of the shows. A DAT copy of the
soundboard was sent to him, but intercepted along the way and made
into this double CD. Whether or not the story is true, the sound quality on
this is almost a guarantee that this is from a (or copy of a) soundboard 
recording.<p>

The packaging on the CD is weak, although there are pictures taken from the
RTB tour included inside. Two of the songs are mislabeled: "Dreamline" is
"Dream Life", and "Subdivisions" is "Sub Divisions". Overall though, care was
taken to make the track listing fairly accurate.<p>

This is a no-nonsense, no-frills, must-have cd. In this little gem you're
paying for sound quality, not pretty pictures. If you can only buy one RTB
show, this is the one to get.<p>
