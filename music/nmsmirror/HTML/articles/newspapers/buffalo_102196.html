<font size=+1>Rush in no hurry with memorable 3-hour concert</font><br>
<b>by Pat Riley</b><p>

Recall that evening of rock and roll you paid for this summer. It was
a "festival." You saw six bands perform a few hits during limp half-hour
sets before they scampered back stage to eat catered food.<p>

Now imagine one band on stage all night performing songs from 12 of
its 16 albums. If you can picture this, it's probably because you were
at the Marine Midland Arena Sunday night when  Rush  played for a
raucous three hours (with a short break) on the second date of its "Test
for Echo" tour.<p>

It's the longest show the power trio from Toronto has ever put
together, and as one of the few active bands with more than 20 years of
material to choose from, it makes sense. This extended play provided its
dedicated legion of Buffalo fans some of the most memorable treats of
their concert-going lives.<p>

Geddy Lee on bass and vocals, Alex Lifeson on guitar and Neil Peart
on drums were in top form performing their singular brand of music -- a
brand that has been labeled everything from "post-progressive" to "the
thinking man's rock."<p>

Lifeson, who's at his best during his ethereal solos, has been riding
high since 1993 when  Rush  returned to its guitar-oriented roots. Trim
and dressed in black, he refrained from his usual comic banter,
delivering his guitar parts with intensity.<p>

It was only appropriate that the band would play something from its
1976 breakthrough concept album "2112," since that record's signature
galloping guitar-bass sound can be heard throughout the latest album,
"Test For Echo." But not even the most fantasy-prone fan could have
expected what was delivered 90 minutes into the evening:  Rush  trotted
out the entire 20-minute concept song "2112," something they haven't
done since shortly after its release. To students of "Professor" Peart's
lyrics, this live performance was a chance to test their memory. And
musically, it may have been the most energized "jam" to take place
in the arena since its opening.<p>

Lee's bass lines were blistering and dominant and his vocals were
right on target, at times soaring with melodic emotion, and shifting
from his higher to lower registers with ease. He was aided by a sound
set-up which was much improved from the audio of the "Counterparts" tour
three years ago that had Lee sounding tinny and distorted.<p>

The air drummers in the crowd rested their arms and paid close
attention as Peart offered the latest version of his masterful drum solo
"The Rhythm Method." Influenced by his recent foray into music of
drummer Buddy Rich and some recent drum lessons, Peart served up his
trademark sounds with noticeable big band variations.<p>

Eager as always to mix the past with the present,  Rush  performed
most of its latest release. Standouts included "Driven" and "Resist,"
with its opening line, "I can learn to resist anything but temptation"
paraphrasing Oscar Wilde.<p>

A driving rendition of 1993's "Animate" whipped up a frenzy while
1970s anthem "Closer to the Heart" inspired a sing-along and a display
of lighters that was remarkable in this anti-tobacco age. But the crowd
responded most whole-heartedly to the songs from the early '80s, with
radio tunes like "Freewill," "Subdivisions" and "Tom Sawyer" supplying
fans with the "adrenaline surge" mentioned in "Red Barchetta."<p>

The jaw-dropper of the night was the brilliant but little known
(i.e., never played on radio) "Natural Science." From the 1980 album
"Permanent Waves," this dynamic, reverberating epic which declares that
"science, like nature, must also be tamed," left half the fans guffawing
with glee and the other half quietly attentive.<p>

"Natural Science" and "2112" together used up 30-minutes -- and  Rush
still  managed to play 24 other fist-pumping songs. As the crowd
filtered out, large sections of the throng continued to scream and
holler, apparently sated beyond words. That's entertainment.
