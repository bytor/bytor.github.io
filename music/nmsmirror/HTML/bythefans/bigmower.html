Big mower goes around the world<br>
Big mower overground<br>
Big mower got a mighty voice<br>
Big mower make big sound<br>
Big mower do a million yards<br>
Big mower make grass sing<br>
Big mower handle acreage<br>
Big mower is the king<p>

Sometimes people push it around<br>
Sometimes a self-propelled<br>
Sometimes working on a fairway<br>
Does the golfing ground<br>
Its the power and the glory<br>
Its the noise in paradise<br>
A multi-horse story<br>
On some hardware store advice<p>

Big mower cuts around the world<br>
Big mower make the news<br>
Big mower cut a mighty swath<br>
Big mower pay your dues<br>
Big mower make suburban dreams<br>
Big mower make big deals<br>
Big mower got some mighty gears<br>
Big mower spin big wheels<p>

Sometimes around ivory towers<br>
Sometimes knocking plants down<br>
Sometimes between the highways<br>
So you can see around<br>
Its the american religion<br>
Its the dry-spell watering rule<br>
Its the menards guy on television<br>
Getting paid to sell cheap tools<p>

Its the power and the glory<br>
Its the noise in paradise<br>
A multi-horse story<br>
On some hardware store advice<p>

Big mower goes around the world<br>
Big mower give and take<br>
Big mower kept some yards is shape<br>
Big mower take a break<br>
Big mower keep a culture intact<br>
Big mower set the rules<br>
Big mower sound like a jet plane<br>
Big mower waste fossil fuels<p>
