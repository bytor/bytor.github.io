<font size=+1>RUSH</font><br>
<b>by Fred Beckley</b><p>

Rush has reinvented itself in its own image, only more so.  After three
years of various non-Rush projects (solo and tribute albums, a travel book,
a percussion instructional video) the three Canadians have hit the road with
a three hour show, their longest ever.  "An Evening With Rush"
(industry-speak for "No Opening Act" features most of "Check for Echo
(Atlantic), a healthy dose of hits ("Closer to the Heart", "Tom Sawyer",
"Subdivisions"), an intermission (hey, they're over 40), and, for the first
time in 20 years, all 20 minutes of "2112." Gone are the keyboard-laden
riffs of, say 1982's "Signals"; "Check for Echo" shows us the metal
prog-rockers in their full guitar glory.  And for you mystical deep
thinkers, lyricist Neil Peart still churns out lines such as: "In the dog
days/People look to Sirius/Dogs cry to the moon/But those connections are
mysterious' (on "Dog Years").<p>
