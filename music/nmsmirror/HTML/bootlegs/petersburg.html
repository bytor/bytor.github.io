This boot can be summed up in one word: avoid!<p>

Although this does contain the entire Counterparts show, the sound quality if
pitiful. The crowd comes through better than the music itself; in some places
it sounds like they were yelling for the purpose of being recorded on tape.
The band is very muffled and distant; the bass seems to come through pretty
well, but the guitar usually doesn't.<p>

This cd also contains several songs from an RTB show, which could have
redeemed it. The sound quality of these songs is just as poor as the CP show,
and sound more tinny. It's also missing most of the volume out of the left
channel.<p>

The booklet has a neat picture of the band during soundcheck (as evidenced by
Alex's shorts and sandals), taken from behind them. Too bad it was taken from
the Counterparts tourbook. The other pictures have also appeared on other 
boots, but are all recent shots.<p>

This boot is identical to the "Florida 1994" cd, same show, same recording,
same dismal sound. Avoid both of them, there are better CP shows out there
(although I have yet to find one!)<p>
