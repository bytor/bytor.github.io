<font size=+1>Rush delivers splendid Knick show with old, new songs -- plus 
visuals</font><br>
<b>by Michael Lisi</b><p>

Albany -- It's been two years since Rush last hit the road and went on tour,
but the band hasn't spent that time off resting on its laurels.<p>

In fact, Rush has accomplished quite a lot since then.  Vocalist Geddy Lee
has become a father, guitarist Alex Lifeson produced his first solo album and
drummer Neil Peart produced a Buddy Rich tribute record.<p>

The band's vacation ended in January, when the trio went to record its latest
record, "Test For Echo," at Woodstock's Bearsville Studios -- just as the
Blizzard of '96 hit the area.<p>

It's been nothing but work, work, work since then, with Rush putting the
finishing touches to its three-hour live show this week during final pre-tour
rehearsals at the Glens Falls Civic Center.<p>

Rush showed that practice makes perfect at the Knickerbocker Arena on
Saturday night, kicking off its tour with a visual and aural attack that had
the near-sellout crowd on its feet and screaming all night long.<p>

The time off really seemed to rejuvenate and energize the power trio, who
performed a superb mix of new and old songs during its two 90-minute sets.  A
huge bonus for Capital Region fans: They were the first to see and hear Rush
play "2112" in its entirety in concert.<p>

Fans screamed and waved their hands through the 20-minute song and sat in
stunned disbelief after Rush ended the song to close its first set.  One fan
kept mouthing the word "unbelievable" minutes after the band left the stage.<p>

The band itself really seemed to relish playing the entire song live instead
of just performing parts of the seven movements of the song - which time
constraints have forced them to do in the past.<p>

There were plenty more hits as well: songs like "Red Barchetta," "Free Will,"
"The Trees," "Nobody's Hero" and a powerful read of the obligatory "Closer To
The Heart."<p>

The three men were able to breathe life into "Heart," a song they're probably
plenty sick of playing.  They could have simply gone through the motions and
got thunderous applause.<p>

But Lee, looking very much like John Lennon circa 1972 with long stringy hair
and wire-framed glasses, Peart and Lifeson really rocked it up and looked
like they were having a blast doing so.<p>

The band's new songs, tunes like "Limbo," "Driven," a driving read of
"Virtuality," and a version of "Test For Echo" (to open the second set) were
right on the mark as well.<p>

And if the music wasn't enough, the band's laser light show should have been.
Without question, it just doesn't get any better than this.<p>

A large movie-sized screen behind the band made it easier for people in the
cheaper seats to see the on-stage action.  Rush showed film clips and other
visual effects on the screens during most of the songs, which only added to
the experience.<p>

The band was right on the money as well.  Lee, who looked like he was reading
lyrics from a teleprompter on some of the new stuff, was in perfect vocal
form.  His trademark high-pitched voice sounded especially great on "The
Trees" and "2112."<p>

Lifeson and Peart, considered by many to be the best rock-and-roll
timekeepers ever, were amazingly tight as usual.  Peart's drum riser rotated,
allowing him to switch between two sets of drums during the show.<p>

Rush fans who feared that the Canadian rockers might be a bit rusty after
their layoff had no reason to worry after the show started.  Simply put, the
band sounded better than ever.
