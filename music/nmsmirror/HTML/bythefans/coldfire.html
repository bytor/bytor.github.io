The rain began falling outside at about six p.m. Rain puts me In the Mood -
a variety of moods - the most being a sense of security of being dry inside
when it is wet outside and safe inside when there is weather outside. But
tonight I feel very much like being out in the rain. Like Tears that fall
from  a lover's eyes. And I love to drive my truck - especially at night in
the rain. Fly By Night.<p>

Great tires, great handling and a great driver. A confident, cocky
individual. Sometimes I think I should have grown up in Georgia, Tennessee
or one of the Carolinas - and been a famous stock car driver. Except driving
in circles. And winning the race. A driver on a busy freeway, racing the
oblivious cars.<p>

The first time I ever got behind the Big Wheel of a car was at my uncle's
house in Connecticut. He knew I had never driven before. It was some kind of
reward I think. A beginning. He was patient and not too demanding. Giving
instructions with a cool brow, teaching me when to shift gears based on the
sound of the turbine freight. I remember driving down a big hill toward his
house and I was accelerating down the steep grade instead of letting the
engine and the road draw me down. He said I should check the speed of the
vehicle - but it was difficult to take my eyes off the road. I didn't want
to. I was scared to. We were speeding. And although it was only an old
Datsun B210, I believe, - Orange - but it felt like we in a Red Barchetta.<p>

Having a lover with you or being sexual by yourself while it is raining out
is another one of those moods I fall under when it rains. Open the window,
climb under the covers and stay very warm. Get really hot. Taking in two
sounds of two different types of wetness at the same time. Being inside and
dry, but also wet. Draw back the down comforter to cool off, blow out what's
left of the candles and snuggle up Where Two Halves Make Two Wholes and slip
into a long Dreamline, fantasizing that I'm a Double Agent.<p>

A hard, driving rain excites me. I want to feel it hitting my skin and
running down my face, see and hear it splattering on my windshield aimed
toward the sky and feel my tires, which stick to the asphalt and concrete
like glue, draw me to my destination, which sometimes are places that I have
never been before. Call it a highway to redemption. We are only happy at
home when we're on the fly anyway. Cut to the Chase.<p>

The rain incites me to chase something - to seek something out. There is a
warmth that comes with a cold rain - of going out into it and knowing what
lies at my destination. Yet when I get there, I have no idea of who I will
meet, what I will see or  what I might find. It's not love, it's fantasy
land. Painted streets in lights glittering all over the road in reds,
greens, yellows and neon. Especially neon. I See Red. The excitement builds
as the tension does and turns into pure desire and lust. Like a private eye
in my loins, I Detect and Emotion.<p>

Like a Stranger Coming Out of The Rain, I browse and become aroused. The
first time I passed her I knew I wanted her. Instantly. But I wanted it to
build up, make the anticipation last.  Let my mind run free. What image can
I build - what picture or scenario will emerge. I am distracted - and barely
notice the others. Doesn't matter. Her beautiful blonde hair spilling past
her shoulders. Her youthful smile and body. Her long legs, smooth, angular
face and dark brown eyes. Her clothes. It all draws me inside. Time to  Roll
the Bones.<p>

We speak, at last. She said come on in and take a seat. I said you are the
type that I'd like to meet. There are still raindrops on my clothes, yet I
feel warm with her. I Can't Deny a Stranger is a Long Awaited Friend, I
think to myself. She said can I start? I said, sure, I'll do my part. She
knew exactly what I liked without even asking. Her moves are instinctive and
practiced, but spontaneous, like a romantic and gently experienced lover.
Cool and Remote Like a Dancing Girl. In the Heat and the Beat of the Night.
And the Light.<p>

Separated by the glass, we talk about the rain - about being hot under the
covers - and her voice is soothing, encouraging and erotic. I am entranced
and a little more shy, for a change. I am humbled by a beautiful woman, I
think. I like watching and listening to her. So much so that sometimes I
can't look at her for a few moments - the way she knows what I want makes me
- blush? - but my eyes return to you out of sheer want, desire, lust and
confidence. Hold your Fire. Keep it Burning Bright, at least for a few more
minutes.<p>

I see you my favorite way now - or is it your favorite? It's difficult to
maintain control because of the chase, the emotion, the fire, anticipation
and the connection. Time is running out. Freeze This Moment a Little Bit
Longer. Make Each Sensation a Little Bit Stronger. Experience Slips Away. I
Let My Past Go Too Fast, No Time to Pause. No Matter What I Pretend. If I
Could Slow It All Down, Like Some Captain, Whose Ship Run Aground...<p>

Time won't Stand Still. It can't. It won't. But an image can be frozen in
time in a picture or in your mind if you look at it a certain way,
especially if you Freeze the Motion. And I look at her and I know that I
will remember the image and take it home with me. And replay it in my mind
over and over again whenever I want. Show Me, Don't Tell Me, I say to
myself. And she does.<p>

Time passes. I'm Losing It. Permanent Waves of pleasure wash over me like
I'm some type of Alien Shore.<p>

As we calm down, our spoken words and smiles are still gentle. I want to
stay here all night.  It has been magical - the rain, the chase, the
stranger, the warm satisfaction you brought to me. It is over too fast. As
fast as a magician pulling a rabbit from his hat, and, poof!. Presto. It's
time to leave.<p>

Driving through the rain back home, I knew she would do the same later in
the night. I wanted to turn around and go back and see her again. But I had
to Keep Moving. Can't Stop. Moving.<p>

I do not know when she is leaving, and I don't know when she might be
around. I'll Be Around, If She Doesn't Let Me Down. Sometimes people search
for something for their whole lives. Even if they find it, they can still
keep looking for it afterward. As long as there may be rain, I will enter
the night and drive through deserted streets, watching the reflections and
remember how warm and wanted I felt with her. I want to see her again - I
want more images to recall, but only a Spirit With a Vision has a Dream With
a Mission.<p>

The rain. Burning hot. Like a Cold Fire.<p>
