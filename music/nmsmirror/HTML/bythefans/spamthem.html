Though your luncheon meat is satisfyingly sweet<br>
Don't be fooled by those childish luncheon treats<br>
When you're shopping, look for 4 letters small and yellow<br>
They signify the pseudo-meat that will make your gizzard bellow!<p>

Spamthem of the heart(burn), Spamthem of the mind<br>
It's best on burnt toast, with fresh pork rinds<br>
Yes, in college we marveled at those who took<br>
Big hunks of Spam and cooked it!<p>

Live for your Spam, this pork product is more enigmatic than briskit!<br>
But rational minds and hungry stomachs would rather go hungry than risk it!<p>

Spam sits on my hearth and taunts me all the time<br>
I'd rather eat dirt than Spam and limes<br>
Yes I marvel at those who take the Spam can<br>
And take their own life into their hands!<br>
Their hands!<p>

Well I know they've always sold you<br>
Spam with jubilation<br>
But have you ever stopped to wonder<br>
Why those cans have no date of expiration?<p>

Spamthem of the lardy Spam -- you all, beware!<br>
It could be the latest development in chemical warfare<br>
Yes, I marvel at those who buy<br>
Cartloads of Spam and don't die!<br>
Don't die!<p>
