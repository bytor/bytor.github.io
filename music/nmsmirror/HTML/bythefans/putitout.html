<p>

Your fingers are yellow<br>
Your teeth are all stained.<br>
No one will kiss you<br>
Got smog in your brain.<p>

Heat of the lighter<br>
Brown stinky tongue<br>
Spit out your stogie<br>
Don't cough up a lung!<p>

Put it out - I don't want your poison<br>
Put it out - Don't blow in my face<br>
Put it out - You smell like an ashtray<br>
Put it out - Get outta my space.<p>

Carbon monoxide;<br>
Nicotine fit.<br>
You choke and get dizzy,<br>
But still you won't quit.<br>
It may not cause cancer;<br>
They still don't have proof.<br>
I'm not taking chances--<br>
Go smoke on the roof!<p>

(chorus)<p>

Put it out<br>
Each day you rinse with Lavoris<br>
To make your mouth smell sweet<br>
Who the heck are you kidding--<br>
Your breath stinks worse than Limbaugh's feet.<br>
You get so used to the warnings,<br>
You still light up in spite of them.<br>
You get so sick in the mornings,<br>
Waking up and coughing up phlegm...<p>

Heat of the lighter<br>
Brown stinky tongue<br>
Spit out your stogie<br>
Don't cough up a lung!<p>

(chorus)<p>

Put it out<br>
Stomp it out<br>
Blow it out<br>
Snuff it out<p>
