No one can survive without a vacuum<br>
Nothing's worse than dust throughout our home<br>
We pretend we're<br>
  cleaner than our neighbors<br>
We've all got dust motes of our own<p>

It's enough to stoop<br>
  to scrub the toilet<br>
We can't clean rugs with Mister Clean<br>
All that we can do is get new carpet --<br>
Replace the floor when things turn green<p>

Every day we're standing<br>
  in a large pig pen<br>
Facing down the river of our mess<br>
Every day we're standing<br>
  in a huge cesspool<br>
Racing 'round to clean it, more or less<p>

It's like a cage<br>
It's an outrage --<br>
We need a mage --<br>
  meet Kirby. Sage...<p>

Looking for<br>
  that vacuum salesman<br>
Catching his long pitch and demo too<br>
Checking out<br>
  the price of his cleaner<br>
Dreading the outrageous payments due<p>

Dust is after all a moving target<br>
I bought the thing,<br>
   but pieces just don't fit<br>
How can anybody use this SUCKER?<br>
I guess I'll let my house just look like sh_t!<p>
