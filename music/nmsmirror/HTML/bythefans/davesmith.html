Dave Smith goes around the world<br>
Dave Smith on the mound<br>
Dave Smith got no mighty pitch<br>
Dave Smith hits the ground<br>
Dave Smith makes a million bucks<br>
Dave Smith's fastball won't rise<br>
Dave Smith blows games the Cubs have led<br>
Dave Smith, drawing flies<p>
<dl><dd>
	Sometimes walking batters around<br>
	Sometimes laying down a rug<br>
	Sometimes giving up homeruns<br>
	Sometimes giving his groin a tug<br>
	It's a long, tired story<br>
	It's a blown save in paradise<br>
	Will he get this batter out?<br>
	It's a tumble of the dice!<p>

Dave Smith's pitches go around the world<br>

Dave Smith likes to lose<br>
Dave Smith breaks a million dreams<br>
Dave Smith, a losing deal<br>
Dave Smith should be shot dead<br>
Dave Smith spins his wheels<p>
<dl><dd>

	Sometimes warming up for hours<br>
	Sometimes knocking batters down<br>
	Sometimes building up your confidence<br>
	Never makes a sound<br>
	It's that Cubs fan's religion<br>
	It's Wrigley he would rule<br>
	He's that lame-armed pitcher<br>
	Get played to play like a fool<p>
